"I ve bought mostly everything for my business from Alibaba. Most of the suppliers I ve dealt with have been great - I ve received what I ordered pretty quickly. Just recently, I had an order go horribly wrong when a supplier took months to even mail out my package, and then it was not what I ordered. I messaged them, and they basically told me to just deal with it and would not make it right. They said if I wanted a refund, I had to pay to ship the items that were not what I ordered back, and the shipping cost was most of what I paid. I was nervous about how Alibaba would handle it. I definitely will continue shopping here after the experience - I was issued a full refund and did not have to pay to ship what I did not order back (thank goodness). Thank you, Alibaba."
"I like Alibaba a lot, however it needs to be brought up how the app malfunctions in chat and after-order services. There is no legitimate reason for it to crash or a seller claims not being able to do something simple like reporting a tracking number. With a large order showing  successfully delivered  in a different US state- I d never know if I was getting scammed by the supplier. The dismissiveness about resolving was riding the clock. Like most carriers, UPS has its quirks but is great with reporting a shipment s location. The screenshot I was sent did not match with UPS global nor domestic and I am a customer. It had not made it to the carrier at all while the seller listed a USPS Express shipment (5-7 days) to Alibaba. It s been 60+ days, still waiting for a complete shipment but if I respond in mobile it resets. I should not have to pay full price and was probably overcharged for shipping. 

I was glad to get Alibaba to step in with their Trade assurance policy. If there is a post-order concern, I ve noticed the app freezes & crashes a lot. It also resets requests. Alibaba runs paying Buyers away with this App. I trust the service but I d expect functions to be way better than eBay s App to disappointment. I really hope there s improvements to come, but desktop mode is better."
"I ordered items and seen that it shipped. That was great at the time. Three weeks later I see that the tracking said that the items was delivered. Yes, they were delivered but not to me or the state that I live in. I contacted the supplier and they claimed that was an error tracking number and sends me a copy of a UPS label that they just created. That means my items never shipped out. I put in a claim with the trade assurance letting them know my items never shipped and the tracking number in my order has nothing to do with my order. I let them know that it needed to be updated to not delivered/ complete so my trade assurance can start on the day the items are actually delivered. To make a long story short they never updated the order and kept saying the supplier made an error with shipping and has fixed it. You will receive your items soon. I tell you they need to hire people who can actually read and write English. Just an horrible experience. This is why I always do test runs with new suppliers and only place small orders for this reason. Now once my order is delivered my trade assurance will be no good because the supplier refuse to update the order because that will prove they necker shipped it out when they claimed they did. This was my experience and it was not a good one."
"Overall pretty good app. Shipping from anywhere takes entirely too long though but that s a given. Unfortunately I had an EXTREMELY bad experience with this supplier 

<Shenzhen Pan-China Industry Co., Ltd.> 

because I left them a 1 star review. It was a very confusing transaction because I THOUGHT I was to be receiving 3 different products due to the order presenting 3 different pictures with 3 different descriptions (1 being a  gift ). I left a review THEN asked for a refund. They refused a refund, frustrated I was fine with the sample box & not receiving a refund, I agreed okay thru the Alibaba app; with that being said I stopped speaking to Amy Zhang because there was nothing else to discuss. However I am unsatisfied with the product (INSIDE DAMAGE AND LOOKED NOTHING LIKE EITHER 3 pictures) AND how Amy Zhang spoke to me. BECAUSE of MY REVIEW & MY EXPERIENCE with them/her, 2 weeks after the matter Amy Zhang felt the need to email my personal email accusing me of being a liar, of wanting free samples AND threatening to  shame my name  all over social medias if I did not change my review. Well, nothing has been resolved. I want Amy Zhang to stop harassing me about description boxes, I told her it was confusing and I already said okay!!!"
"Alibaba needs more shipping options to the U.S. I researched purchasing an electric ATV (quad/four wheeler) for 5 weeks on Alibaba. I looked at 10 different companies. At first I was about to give up completely because none of the companies seemed to understand English well enough to understand my product requirements and what I was looking for. Almost every company told me I could buy the ATV from them and they would ship it to the nearest U.S. seaport, but I would have to figure out how to get it from there, through Customs, and to my home in Utah myself. Most of the companies had no option available to them to do the logistics themselves or to have a 3rd party company do it for them. I finally found 1 of 10 companies that could sell me the ATV, clear customs, and provide ground shipping, but it added 100% to the cost of the product. Alibaba has some great product options, but Please improve the shipping options available so you can increase your sales to the United States. Thanks."
"I ordered Hydraulic hydraulic valves, never received.
 Then I also ordered two lap top computers, received late damaged and only a keyboard without monitor arrived to my neighbors unit. 
Last time I order from China I said,to my self, but I needed help with test diagnostic equipment, the price was overwhelming so I ordered, to find out, a floppy computer disc arrived that was not compatible to my computer drives and not in English. More loss money. 
But recently I had a requirement for a hydraulic seal kit for a pump I am rebuilding, I was quoted long lead times and no availability s.
So I found Allibaba Express paid and received on time the correct item in excellent condition and the vendor kept me updated on the progress of my order. The best service I received anywhere. Next I need a Tandem aluminum hydraulic pump crossing my fingers."
"I'm a fairly new buyer to Alibaba,
Any questions or concerning I have regarding my orders are quickly and efficiently answered.
Navigating the websites can be challenging for a new comers.
Trust me I make a lot of mistakes, I'm sure the sellers look at some of my Request's and say ""What is he thinking"" or ""What is he trying to say"". But I'm getting better and they are SO patient, Its not the end of the world... It was just a typing mistake! Mistakes are learning and learning is the best part of life... There are unbelievably great deals here. This website has changed my life and it can change yours Too.... Just take a deep breath.... Get a cup of coffee... And don't be afraid to ask lots of questions... Now let's go make money... Best of Luck ... Carroll ...USA"
"This has been a very good experience for me. This was my first time, and I have share my experience already with more than forty people. I have talk about with my entire family and many others. I am impressed with the treatment that I received from Mrs Nancy, who was the seller, but also She represented me in China. She expended a lot of time with me looking to satisfy my needs and She did it. I am very thankful with Her work and kindness, gentleness and professional actitud. Now, I am trying to buy another equipment because I am pretty sure that is the best thing that I can do. Thank you Mrs Nancy and all people that took part in this business. God Bless You All. Thank you."
"Be very careful with who you deal with if from the USA. I asked for a quote and was contacted by multiple people. I placed an order for clothes. 20 hats, 20 beenies, 24 hoodies, 5 athletic jumpsuites and 6 wool coats. The sizes were sizes that would fit children. The embroidery wasn t finished, and won t respond to a single message now. The company was Antom Enterprises. I have asked for a return label, corrected order etc. and now they won t respond. I was asked to contact them through WhatsApp they said it would be easier and sent them the money PayPal. Do not do this. Alibaba will not help you with your order or people who scam you. They do not keep track of who contacts you based on your request. I spent over 45mins with alibaba customer service and got no where. This is the perfect site for people to scam people on. I m new to alibaba placed my first sample order for clothing and got ripped off."
I was pushed by eBay to this app only because I was looking for a single item and it is here in America for about $80-$120bucks brand new or $16-$40 bucks plus $539 dollars for freight from China! The people were all helpful and the sets means time the app was a learning experience for me so not a waste of time. I want to delete my information on the app but it seems like it is not accessible to doing so. That s the part I don t like and how lots of people are asking me but when I tried to close the question I pose the automated artificial intelligence chat told me repeatedly that it wasn t updated so I m digging trying to find out how to get to an updated version within the app it s telling. Don t like that.
"I use an ipad and this app has too many glitches to think of right now but my main gripe is a recent change in the search results to only display one third of the image of the product you are searching for. Completely moronic!  Then when you try to swipe down to go back up the list of results it totally closes the search window so you must start over.   On the home screen, most of the time when you click on a product link you wind up frozen on a blank screen.   When you click on promoted items, you wind up randomly somewhere other than the promoted listing page you clicked on.  Come one people, for such a huge and rich company, you have an app that was built by an amature!  It really is dissapointing!"
"I have visited so many mini sites and everyone claims to be a manufacturer.  My recent experience of a purchase did not convince me that I dealt with a manufacturer. It s important that the info is authentic. We need to be sure of whom we are dealing with so that we can achieve our objectives. 

Alibaba has been useful but again, how do we enforce international warranties? We are about to make orders for items that vendor (can t call them manufacturers) are offering 3 years warranties. Also how do we see other customers review about a vendors product? 

Thank you."
"I can t get reliable info from vendors, often parts are sold separately and you are not sure if one component will fit another from a different vendor. Vendors don t reply to inquiries reliably and then send messages asking if you re ready to order. Many products are sold in bulk, minimum purchase of 1,000 or more totaling $950 or more without know what you are getting. Not recommended unless you are fluent in a Chinese/Mandarin. Impossible to delete app account and personal information they have already collected about you. This app is not recommended if you have security concerns. 0 out of 5 stars. Sorry Alibaba. Great idea but execution is a hard fail."
"I'm not completely sure of the purpose for this app, but I think it's for business use and not personal use because a lot
Of items require you to purchase 100 pieces. I would never need this many.
I found some that said 1 piece minimum that had a good price range like $1-50 which is cheap for gymnastics equipment which I was trying to buy. So I messaged the buyer, she was friendly but gave me a price way over the price range. Was disappointed. I'm guessing the price range is before shipping cost because it sounds like shipping is what added the couple hundred of dollars to the price. Shipping needs to be Included in the price range."
"There are hundreds of products, but they all post one price , most have a MSQ listed at XYZ price. Then when a quote is requested the price increases by 400% . The manufacturers expect you to buy a million pieces to give the price originally listed. 
ThTs without the freight fees and no one seems to understand English.  Either that or they just have an auto reply system stating the same over and over. 
It s the worst and most frustrating experience for people who want to do business."
"I bought a pair of shoes which I never received. It was a scam supplier and when I started the refund process, first, they are in China and they barely understand what you say. Second,Their return process will drive you crazy. After trying for 1 hour, I wasn t able to apply for the refund because they made it impossible for the individual customer who buy a single product. You would need to provide a lot of details which is practicaly impossible for a person without a CPA. 
It was a bad experience and please don t think they are American platforms who are providing customer service or that easy.
Let s not waste American dollars here, for God sake. Please support your own business.
Thanks"
"When I first made my account it was just for me to purchase clothing for myself but now I use my account for business the vendors are very responsible and respectful, they reply back quickly and when your custom items are shipped it doesn t take long shipping may take up to 2 weeks which is perfect for me. You might come across a few vendors that s doing a bit much but other than that it s a great app"
"I ve worked with sellers on Alibaba for many years and have spent A LOT to have really amazing things built at affordable prices.  Most of them are great, however some are not and it seems Alibaba is unwilling to offer buyer protection as they have described. We recently ordered a very expensive electric vehicle for our business that was over $10K. Everything was great until US customs miscategoriezed it and it was rejected.  We tried everything possible to fix this issue but unfortunately it had to be shipped back.  We paid for the return shipping. Now the manufacture is unwilling to provide us with a refund and we LOST the trade assurance dispute with Alibaba. This is ridiculous."
"This app is great, I love that I can place an order from just about anywhere.  It s user friendly and it lets you save your favorite suppliers and favorite items and when you are ready you can quickly place an order from your favorites list or from an automatic  start order  list that appears when you go to one particular supplier... it will list and show all their items available based on your search details.  Very cool app, I love it..."
"I m super disappointed with Alibaba. I ve order a few times but recently had a situation where the e supplier sent the equipment without all the parts, changed the design and had bad welds. I reached out through the Trade Assurance program and Alibaba said there was very little they could do. They offered a very small compensation due to the manufacturer issue but the app does t have a UI button to accept the offer so I was unable to accept it. In addition to the guarantees of the Trade Assurance program being worthless the app was buggy leading to multiple attempts to try to resolve the situation. Really bummed with Alibaba."
"I like most of what I see each time I look ! Problem no info on cost of shipping ! 
Plus it would be nice to have someone here in Maine selling your products for you ! It would be a great plus as people that build here over charge ! Having some of you big products such as food trailers and trucks would sell great here ! Thank You ! Brad  !"
"I like Alex press and enjoy many of the products. I would like to know about the shipping possibilities if they could be a little quicker is that possible? And I would also like to inquire about the quantities that can be ordered. Four instance, is there a possibility of ordering a smaller amount for now until the business begins to grow a little bigger and the demand gets better then expand to a larger amount? Thank you for your concerns. Jimmie Rivera, Allentown Pennsylvania USA"
"I bought merchandise from one of the vendors which still I have not received they kept changing  the date I opened a dispute since I was getting no where the vendor send me a message saying if I didn t change my dispute he would not refund me I escalated the issue still no refund I m very disappointed and I believe could have been handled differently my dispute is still open , I have my own business and I m work with other business I will be letting them know about my experience . I upload pictures of the messages from the vendor to the dispute department ."
"New user to alibaba, but no stranger to using sourcing apps for our business.  Hands down one of the best designed and smoothest apps I have used.  Able to access and enjoy everything I need through its intuitive and friendly arrangement. 

My review is based on the applications user experience and not based on what some other reviews seem to harp over."
"The app is out dated, slow and needs to be revamped. I ve also experienced adverse response dealing with Trade Association. I was scammed out of 7k US dollars by the Yang Yang company. A vendor should never want to keep the full payment after 48 hours of payment submittal without providing service/product. In addition to that I have had Trade Association employees respond to me who can t write or speak proper English which poses a barrier. You must also be careful bcuz some Trade Association reps are bias due to being friends with some of the vendors. Please make sure you vett the company s sales, leadership team, and quality of the products."
I cant seem to login from my cellphone without a bunch of headache. Works fine from desktop some security they have makes it liters impossible for clients to access their accounts beyond frustrating ruins the quality of alibaba overall
"Easy to browse, filters are nice to have to narrow products down a lot. 
  Some sellers descriptions and prices can be very misleading.  
   You have to be savvy when browsing and look at whose selling an item, a manufacturer, a wholesaler or trading company.  
    And knowing about the product when inquiring with seller helps lessen any confusion between you two.  
  Very happy with the companies I have worked with so far."
I bought a laptop to check and see if this thing is legit. I m new to all of this. And it was a verified seller. Scammed. Now have a dispute and they don t want to pay me my money. This is ruining the site. And now I m afraid to buy anything else from there. Cruel world. Now the dispute takes forever. Can t get it moving. It s a waiting game. Now it s gonna be a crap show. Now I sent all the info to show it s a scam. But I still think I m gonna get screwed. Because I paid off site. Probably worse they will do is shut the account down.
"My experience on Alibaba is Horrible. Feel like most of chinese suppliers are Cheating. My first supplier asked more charge from me after I transferred payment with Wireless transfer. So I had to cancel it costed me waste my transfer fee. Second supplier ( air transportation service) is more horrible.I paid them fast air ( most expensive)which will take around 10 days as they said , but actually it taking around 20 days n no update for my items yet. So disappointed and full of horrible App ever I had shopping."
"Difficult to get cost on items.
Suppliers respond to odd items that I ve not even asked about.
Some have responded to inquiries I ve made about their items, cost and shipping information with nonsense or canned replies that have no relation to the question i asked them.
Order process is not straightforward or intuitive.
Overall not a confidence building experience.
All the above makes everything seem  shady  or worrisome that something criminal could happen with my payment information.

There definitely are items here that I want/need that are not available on AliExpress so I may continue to inquire until I find a supplier that gives confidence of a happy outcome but overall I just wish the item I seek was available from a supplier on AliExpress...I have many hundreds of dollars there and have had a 100% Good experience at there."
This is the best site in the world! It helped me create a clothing company and amass almost $2.5 million dollars! I was sitting at home wondering how can I get my clothes made? I don t know how to sew or had much knowledge about designing. I was sad. I wondered  how can I really get off the ground and build something great  but then liberty mutual called and I broke into my happy dance.
"I have to admit,it is always a learning experience and fun to see all the new ideas,,advanced and rends,also the interactive shopping experience every time I use any service on this site or the app..thankyou for making this possible  "
"A truly wonderful experience I have with Alibaba. You can find just about all you need by looking it up on the site. The prices are more than reasonable and it s very enjoyable to browse through what you re interested in purchasing.

"For today s complaint. I had purchased some clear transparent epoxy resin and Hardner from  maidaofu  at Foshan madoff chemical Co ltd. 

I showed her pictures of what I was doing and that I also would be using transparent pigment to color the transparent epoxy. She never once told me that she was sending brown Hardner. Literally the color of coffee. 

When I addressed her about this, she told me that I asked for Brown which is a lie and added me to the blacklist instead of communicating or sending me to her boss to communicate

In our messages, I clearly state that it needs to be transparent and this is utterly ridiculous having her tell me that she was not made clear requirements.

 I need them to be contacted, they need to send me CLEAR Hardner to fix the improper product that they sent."
"I am needed you to explain the process  and what it is that I m suppose to accomplish. 
I want some quick training please . 
I can make this work a miracle. 
Send me some type of paperwork that I m hired and I m in school training."
"Since the adoption and enforcement of basically having to have the app, I have found the entire experience slow and difficult.

It is not fun to utilize Alibaba - and it is not better for business.

It is a very good example of a company that has tons of money but no understanding of what made it grow so quickly. It is one of the worst apps I have ever used from a well funded company."
Everyone seems to use everyone else photos as if they done the work. very hard to figure out who is telling the truth. Alibaba needs to crack down on this and make sure suppliers are not using someone else s photos. Not everyone is as smart or know the apparel industry to know what s the truth and what s a lie when it comes to shipping and fabric. Don t be so quick to send payment without doing research on the company you are working with.
"This is a bad trick to make your customers keep opening the app. I try to respond to to my chat messages but 90% of the time, there are no messages, just promotions. 

This wastes my time and makes me stop opening the app which creates a bad experience and delays for chat.

Stop being greedy with promotions. People know what they want and they certainly don t like to be tricked and have their time wasted."
"So far companies on this app seem flaky.  I email and if I am lucky enough to get a response they stop responding after the first email and don t seem too pleased if your only interested in ordering the moq. Sorry I need all product and shipping details? My bad for inquiring about your other products? App could be better designed too, I feel it could flow a little better."
Awesome products even though most are from China I d rather order from them as they are one step above our technology and everything I ve owned made in China has been built to last.
"So I downloaded the app because the messaging system was confusing to me on the actual website. The app is wayyy more user friendly plus I can make deals on the go!!!! Perfect,and I love how quick the suppliers reply!"
"Yet to place a order. But from the experience of someone who is not as internet savvy. The website and help service is user friendly and prices are far beyond its competitors. More importantly the brand has world wide reputation that s been labeled 5 stars and meets all those expectations. Looking forward to a lasting business relationship with this company in these times of imitation, sale first, and culture outdated concepts and missions.

"Good interface, very intuitive app, the service alibaba is a great design to connect the manufacturers right to the businesses. No problems so far but I ve only had the app for four minutes so we ll have to see"
"Such a convoluted buying process. Have not found a single  Buy Now  button. You have to jump through all these hoops. Send snd inquiry. Ask specific questions, very specific. So you better know what it is exactly that you want or suffer the consequences. Then ask for a price. Just not a US buyer/seller type setup."
I have had many very good experiences and response from most factoryies I have worked with. Like with everything else we had A few were bad experiences but for the most part it it great.
"If you get lied to by a seller and want a canceled order, good luck getting your order canceled and your money back. I ve been lied to buy a seller and when I tried to cancel it he order 2 days after placing the order, alibaba customer service said good luck and deal with the seller directly. First and last time I will ever use this site. What a horrible experience"
"How could I check the customer experiences about a particular items??
When I need to buy anything I need to know the customers opinions about it  
Or tell me how?"
"A lot of interesting features that set Alibaba away from the norm.  Lots of interface to talk directly at super fast response time.  Would highly recommend to friends and co workers for businesses.  
Thank you!!"
I like the idea of having an inquiry prompt. It s hard to tell exact size on some items and I m hindered due to the fact that we don t use metric in USA.
I ve been struggling for 5 months now the merchant says my stuff are at customs I no longer want the product and Alibaba aren t helping me out worst experience I ve had my money has be stranded for months now and I still haven t gotten my product make sure you are willing to put your money on hold for a while before you buy anything.
My Rep is responsive and always on target even with her load of clients. I ve had really great experiences and the items I m purchasing are top notch.
I shouldn t say this but there s no other place for quality pricing for quality equipment then this place. if I shop somewhere else I m only cheating myself.
"The app/website is very confusing and not organized. I don t get notifications accurately when suing or not using the app unless I m on the main page. 
Transportation companies are the king. They decide whatever price they want. Vary too much among different companies."
"Some deals to be found, but when using the app on iPad, or even in the browser the images are too large, fonts get cut off. Jumbled clunky user interface. Needs work. Even selected desktop website, with not much difference."
"I had a terrible experience since the supplier who has gold rating, has been on Alibaba for three years decided to raise the price of the product after I paid. I requested a refund a have to wait 3 weeks for the money to be refunded. The banking fee of 46$ will not be refunded. I will not use this website anymore and would suggest that no one from the US goes through what I went through."
"I think the website is built very nicely however I was not able to give him a question about photos of the vehicle. Please contact me back I m very interested in the
in the taxi"
"The worst experience I have ever had in my whole life, ordered 3 times through Alibaba and the orders never got shipped out form china. I asked for a refund and they are taking 10 years to process and finalize the refund. They try their best to keep the orders but they do nothing to fasten the shipping times. They really wasted my time ordering from them. I WOULD NEVER ORDER ANYTHING FORM THIS APP."
I can t believe EVERYONE doesn t know about or use this.  I m new to Alibaba but so far it is quite an amazing experience.  I m excited about learning more!
My experience with this company has been awesome great customer service and feel you in every step of the way
Sometimes sellers respond quickly and other times slow. But over all have found many things I could not imagine existed.
We use Alibaba for locating product components that we require. We have never been let down. Excellent business platform.
"Accurate, quality site. Most of the wholesalers respond quickly and with detailed information. I like it a lot"
I have had a great experience on Ali-Baba. I made my first purchase and was happy when I received my product as advertised. I will be doing more business with Ali-Baba. Thank you for this awesome platform.  
"If I could give this app zero stars, I would. No matter how careful you are on this site, there s just so many scammers on here. I bought my first (and definitely the last) order on here, and the seller sent me the wrong item. Wouldn t refund me, and told me to just keep what I had. Extremely negative experience."
Sometimes I need to resort to Google.  If I am looking for a 12 watt small lamp I often get a bunch of many watt street lamps. There are some good ways to narrow a search but it isn t as intuitive as expected.
The listings are not detailed enough.  There needs to be better listing standards across all items for sale.  I would also like to have estimated shipping costs on every item I view.  Inquiries are either taking too long or no supplier responds to my inquiries.  Sellers should be required to have all the right details.
"I am not sure if this is right, because I have made inquiries in the past and no response. Please let me know if this right business site to buy used cars. Fatasaaba"
I am interested in buying the portable storage houses they have but it says you have to buy a minimum amount and I only need one I am trying to build a house of grid and was recommended this app but it s seems this is mostly bulk sell unless each unit is like a part or something I am very confused
It is difficult the purchase the required product observing the tedious procedure of filling up the documents. Please make it simple so that illiterates like me can also place the orders.
"I,been looking for something large pre- built and taken apart for shipping."
"Not understanding how others are having such a great experience this app. The UI is very disappointing considering size of business. Highly unreliable login & over interface struggles. Don t recommend app, use on computer for best experience."
"Once you get registered, the app works well, just be prepared to wait a day or two for the confirmation email. I get very fast responses to inquiries."
"I am very march interested in a price on your transportation equipment, any chance of getting a price list on all of your 4 wheel 4 wheeler s and Jeep type and 4x4  and scooter type transportation, not interested in electrical ones , gas and diesel only"
"Aloha I have been a huge fan of Alibaba over a decade. . .Could be the Worlds best company, definitely the best as far as I am concerned. . .Highly recommend for types of materials and laser equipment . . ."
"Professional, quick response to questions. Would definitely refer they re site to anyone."
Why is there no phone number to make a phone call to somebody and find out what s going on and how to order the equipment and answer some simple questions so frustrating
I enjoy this experience because you can find everything needed!! Plus more
I was so impress how easy it was to make an inquiry with Ali Baba; my question now is shipping them to the islands from your end. How much will my cost be from China to Micronesia via USPS. Thank you
Quite everything am looking for @ very very affordable prices!
Absolutely love this app and the vendors!! Quick service prompt and professional
Great need more info on some cars just not sure about small Buisness
SO much more intuitive than using Alibaba on my computer! Wild
Quick response and quality products. Be very specific in your inquiries.
They did a nice job building this website
This is my second attempt to navigate the system. It is not intuitively obvious how to complete orders which apparently require communication with the seller. There is a certain level of frustration here.
"Very good and quick response, I recommend anyone interested in buy to give this market place a shot"
"Always happy with my purchases and prompt responses to inquiries. Makes my life easier trusting in them. 
Thank you much 
Gigirebecca"
"On the regular website it allows you to register an account via gmail quick access, which is what I did.  On the app, the only options for quick access are Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter.  So I cannot login using the app, only the desktop/mobile website."
"the worst experience, we paid  $3,800 dollars from me and neither the seller nor the company wants to respond to give me my money back, and the alibaba representatives can not help you at all because it is as if they understand   honestly do not buy construction drill sellers they are a scam company"
This is a quick and easy way to reach thousands of vendors to help manufacture your products.
This is a great tool but the amount of spam that gets sent through the inbox from suppliers also makes it quite an annoyance.
"This is my first experience with this company, was told they are fair and easy to work with. I am interested in purchasing a paddle boat."
I was amazed at how easy the app worked and how intuitive to operate.  Now to find out how responsive the sellers are!
"Great variety of suppliers and products. 
The distinction between inquiries and messaging is very confusing and the user interface with messaging and speed is like a 3rd grader made the app. Needs to be quicker and smoother and very clear."
Found the required item source so quick
All vendors that I ve been in contact with has exceeded my idea of excellence and provided a great buying experience
The app is really cool especially it shows varieties of equipment and products but my challenge is how to place an order and I need a low MOQ. In all you're doing a great job
There needs to be more more manufacturers from around the globe. Like Italy and etc. but it s good. Also they shouldn t ban someone s account if they sent multiple inquiries..
This app is slow and gets stuck sometimes. I have a better experience on the website.
Hank you for the quick response
I personally find it quite hard to navigate the site
"I am a new customer for Alibaba, I would like to know if I can 3 dozens of your products instead of your minimum required"
"So far I had all good experiences,alibaba has been very reliable."
"I could browse and chat with suppliers.  But could not get placing or paying for orders to work.

My advice: stick to the web site.   App is not quite ready for prime time."
Always find AliBaba fruitful Source for making business deal with top manufacturing firms
I downloaded this app to write a review on something disgusting I saw this morning an add with a child clearly underaged in a swimsuit with the name under saying  sexy kids bikini.  Who ever chose to use that word marketing children s swimwear needs to be fired or something. I reported the add but I still have a screenshot for proof. I m sill very unsettled.
Love having this app on my phone for quick communication with suppliers.
"You are crazy, your company made it impossible to buy anything from you, absolutely unnecessary filling out the forms that you require, and I am no longer going to buy anything from you, and I will inform my friends."
"I tried placing order for 1000 pieces. Though they require me to pay in cash app not in alibaba. 
I complaint  about them in alibaba customers service. They didn't take any action as well!!!!!!!"
I purchased barbershop equipment because I thought it would be cheaper I ended paying double the price at the end when they started charging me extra shipping cost port charges warehouse fees I m really upset will never buy again and will spread the word about this scam
"The app is enjoyable, but I am a new startup business, and many of the suppliers require that multiple units be purchased. I only need one unit of the items in which I am interested."
The Deals look great. Closing the deal is where they overcharge in some companies. Some are quick and sending demo . And the other 50 % ignore you unless you have a what s up app .
Very quick response! friendly and warm atmosphere!
We love build for houses and businesses too faster living modern environment.
Be very careful using I had bad experience with scammer seller on this app even after dispute case was opened twice they couldn t solve the issue and the scammer got away with it.
I prefer shops that already allow purchase without inquiries. This is cumbersome.
Horrible customer service I received horrible experience this app this a ripoff and it is unfair and not ridiculous don t waste your money my experience was the worst and I am a big online shopper just horrible
"Very Very very very very very very very very bad company please don t use this company I already lost a lot of money because of this.
This supplier Lie to me and still my money.

"Very good app, easy to navigate and receive quick responses."
"Not very intuitive, complicated business model, confusing replies. I have made multiple orders and haven t received anything yet....but I m hopeful"
I have been dealing with this Company for years starting 2008very go experience.
App is efficient and fluid. Easy to use.
I want sets but it s making me buy individual pieces to build my sets
"Dear Sir:
Please help find Brazil Sour Honey that cures Cancer.  I sent an inquiry to Supplier hoping that this Organic Sour Honey is from Brazil.
Thank You,
Rita"
The user interface makes this app unbearable to use. Everything is gigantic and there is no way to resize the resolution to make browsing more comfortable.
Any wait to start buying my new equipment
"It s hard to navigate on here and you need to be like AliExpress and have a checkout pay now button to purchase and be done,This is a horrible experience.I have gotten any good help yet."
Great website. Some suppliers are horrible when it comes to replying to inquiries.
This app is way too confusing. Why can t you simply order a jersey instead of sending inquiry. I will stick with DHgate.
"Nice and intuitive app, very easy to use"
Great app. Easy to navigate. I have had great experiences working with vendors on Alibaba.
"Easy inquiry process, thank you"
"Awesome resources for any business. Easy, fun and quick services. Thanks Alibaba!!"
"The sellers advertise ""Low Minimum Order Quantity"" to attract buyers but when you submit an inquiry, you quickly find out their required MOQ is not even close to whats advertised. Had many bad experiences on alibaba."
Great supplier great services. Nice buying experience!
"But I m getting ready to, these prices in salon equipment are great!  Will be back to let ya know."
No after sales service since 5 month we are waiting for seller assistance to use their USD6000 machine. Really sad experience
"Often times when you inquire they say contact us at WhatsApp, we ll that s an immediate Red Flag and almost certainly A downright scam! Can t trust it."
Poor performance and confusing interface.
"I m a SaudiArabia citizen, AliExpress is a great experience.. Future Marketing !"
I just inquired about a product from a manufacturer in China and they somehow turned it into an ORDER for $ 7500. Beware there s a big gap in communication and sometimes ethics.
"most of the businesses does not know hot to respond timely, i inquired about ads of gem stones and jewelries and no anwer"
"This app is a fraud. I had the worst experience ever, a seller stole my money and never sent any of my items, and she refused to send back the money. The website was not helpful in solving the matter."
Easy to find required items. Problem is only with credit card payment.
the payment method quite difficult as need to keep logging in. and some error keep on happening during payment
Just recently purchase an electric folding bike here from Alibaba. I ve always been using Amazon but I saw it in Alibaba that was offering a better price that was way cheaper than buying it from Amazon. So I decided to buy it from Alibaba instead. My experience has been wonderful the customer service is nothing short than great. It only took them to sent the product to my front door in 4 days that is amazing. The product works like a charm and I m loving my e-bike. It s called Coswheel definitely would buy it again from Alibaba. It s going to be a blast buying it from here. Thank you from Malaysia
This app has many problem to browse it. i can't smoothly use this app. bad experience.
The app is quite good
It was an exciting experience
Very poor app even tech savvy can't easily understand the way of chat and inquiry process in one go. Shipping charges are sometime 1000 times than the actual product. Due to so many glitches I didn't go for any shopping this time after downloading it after 5 years.
Very good experience this alibaba

"Easy to order from Shenyang Niuxitaier Musical Instrument Co., Ltd. Doris was wonderful. I'll order more when the time comes. Singing bowls were perfect pitch, wonderfully built and shipped in some of the best packing boxes Ive ever seen in my entire life. Doris made the bowls exactly what I wanted. I chose the speed of shipping and it took about a month because I'm cheap! I choose not to ship any faster because it's expensive! Doris cant control the cost nor the time it takes to make its way to the US. The bowls arrived via UPS here in the US."
"Qulity product, Awesome service, Fast delivery!
This blinds are top notch! Very elegant design and very modern look.
Product is not cheap, the materials used have lots of quality and are very durable.
Placed the order on June 5 and Received it on June 12.
Second time buying from this seller and again, I had a great experience.
Great job Zhejiang Muxuan Home Furnishing Co., Ltd.
Thank you Rena, you're awesome!"
"I liked that these adapters purchased were exactly as described. They work good with the device I plugged into them. They company is going to make a lot of sales because the price is low, quality is good, and they can be relied upon for delivery from halfway across the world. All in all it was a great experience!"
"Aside from a couple of minor details that were quickly rectified it was a pleasure to deal with this company. Communication was good and quick and the whole transaction went smoothly, culminating in a prompt delivery"
"vraiment faire attention aucune protection chez Alibaba. j'ai fait deux commande identique et une arrive a moiti . donc facile a v rifier car le poids change du premier colis au deuxi me. mais Alibaba me la mis dans la BABA. a fuir.

really be careful no protection at alibaba. I made two identical orders and one arrived halfway. therefore easy to check because the weight changes from the first package to the second. but Alibaba put it in BABA for me. to flee."

HIGHLY RECOMMEND.  ommunication and delivery were just as good."

"Rachel Wang from Guangzhou Ruijia Packing Products Co., Ltd very friendly and nice to speak with. Company entertains MOQ of 3000 pieces. Until now, I keep a good memory and experience with them.

On the other hand, bad services received from Huizhou Poleview Commodity Co. Ltd (Ginnie Young) and Shenzhen Anko Industry Co. Ltd (Lego Chen). They both show false prices regarding loofahs. When I confirm minimum price for minimum MOQ in chat boxes, Ginnie Young replied an abrut 'no' and Lego Chen replied an abrut 'no' followed by block his customers. Until now, I can only remember a bad feeling received on that day."
"It was my first time using Alibaba to search for manufacturer. It's easy to use, intuitive and loads of different options to make payment. Having application installed on smartphone you will not miss any notifications with messages from sellers. Great tool!"
"1) very very bad experience on Alibaba.com took trade assurance 100% unsafe at all plenty of time contact him higher team reply 2-3 day again and again till full month passed after protection finished but i am open matter more than a month how much cheap and cheat peoples online. 2) Late Dispatch according Alibaba.com rules could not follow his own rules. Really rubbish, bad supplier and himself cheat peoples."
"I cannot be more happy with Jason Deng at Dongguan City Xiong Fei Electric Material Co., Ltd. he is an awesome proffesional, always helping and giving good advices even if you are quite noob on this kind of issues. The quality of the product and the results are better than spected, and i am working with them for a couple of months.
the best company and best seller for creators"
"Communication and understanding was very easy at all steps in process. Service was knowledgeable and friendly. Company adapted with ease to product design specifics. From date of order it was shipment ready within 10 days. Further, based on experience with the product over the past 3 weeks, it performs as expected. Shipping as managed by the manufacturer was great. For instance, within 4 days product arrived in a city near me and was though customs. Meanwhile UPS on my end was slow to the mark and added a further 4 days. Overall very satisfied."
"The shipment and receipt of the package was a success. The attention was fast, cordial and very professional, especially from Kelly Ma, who was very cordial, attentive and willing to help me in the purchase and shipment of the equipment."
"I had an excellent experience with the product I purchased, and it exceeded my expectations. The seller, ""Sam,"" was incredibly attentive to every detail and demonstrated a high level of professionalism in their work and the service they provided. I highly recommend their services."
"The website is very confused, not friendly and it took me quite ling time to understand how It worked.
I never will use this platform again. I had to pay huge taxation to get the good cleared from custom. UPS charged me the same value than the original price. So I paid double without any advice or short notice.
So, horrible experience and you will not see my face here again."
"My first time purchasing on Alibaba and it was a great experience. The supplier I chose was super friendly, quick in her replies and very professional.
A lot of negative reviews about Alibaba but mine was the exact opposite. You just need to ensure you choose the right (and VERIFIED) supplier to avoid scams and disappointments."
"The service is always great, and the quality of the product is very good. The product is delivered very quick using good courier companies."
I easily found a company able to provide the scarves I required. The company provided an excellent product with prompt despatch and excellent communications. Will certainly use again.
A trust inspiring experience! Alibaba's platform is well laid out and makes it easy to identify trustworthy companies to work with. The process of communicating and ordering from companies seems very well managed by the platform and ensures that the customer is well protected from scammers. Will definitely use Alibaba again!
"They (the manufacturer) were very patient and responded to all inquiries and concerns throughout the process. Shipping was fast and well-packaged. Value was significant. The platform to connect, communicate, and transact worked very well."
"The experience using the platform was great because everything was clear and straightforward since the beginning. The products I ordered were delivered on time according to schedule, and they matched the pictures shown on the website perfectly. The communication was easy, fluent, and professional at all times."
"The fact that we were able to use Alibaba for our payment definitely made dealing with a new supplier easier and gave us added confidence. The professionalism of Tony in arranging everything meant that overall we had a great experience. The monitor we purchased was delivered not only on time but 1 day earlier than expected and the monitor being exactly as promised made us a very happy customer.

"During the whole process the support received was first class.

Everything quoted and stated was met without fault.

The product itself is also wonderful and overall a very satisfying purchase and experience."
Thank you for opening up new opportunities for us to purchase our business product from China. The entire experience has helped our business grow!
Customer service from Victor & his team @ Jinyu Sporting company. Expert guidance & provided a range of choices/options for personalising specifications of an ebike. Very smooth transaction too!
"I had an outstanding experience shopping on Alibaba.com. The customer service was excellent, promptly and courteously answering all my questions. I found the company to be highly cooperative, willing to adjust to my requirements and changes. The cost of my purchases was within an acceptable range, leading to a very satisfying buying experience. Overall, I would highly recommend Alibaba.com to anyone looking for high-quality products and exceptional service"
Everything was very well explained and the process of purchasing an expensive piece of equipment was smooth and trouble-free.
overall it was a good experience with platform transaction. but the Messages sometime didn't show supplier on list even though we spoke to each other and had order placed.
They checked in with me via internet to guide the process of my order. Very good.
"Very very very third class things. 
Show me different things send me different very very bad experience. "
"With Alibaba, I was able to find a supplier who brought my idea to life and one that I can build a relationship with."
"The Agents were very kind, the product is perfect and the price is good, the delivery was on time, the experience was very good in general."
What I liked the most about the company was its genuine willingness and commitment to do business with me despite the fact that was not looking for many qualities.
"I recently had the opportunity to explore Alibaba as a platform for sourcing suppliers from China, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations in every way. Alibaba has truly established itself as the go-to platform for businesses looking to connect with suppliers and secure the best prices in the market. Here's why I believe Alibaba is the best platform for this purpose.

Vast Supplier Network: Alibaba boasts an extensive network of suppliers, encompassing a wide range of industries and products. Whether you're looking for electronics, clothing, machinery, or any other type of product, you'll find countless suppliers on Alibaba willing to cater to your needs. The platform's vast supplier database ensures that you can explore multiple options and choose the one that best suits your requirements.

Competitive Pricing: One of the biggest advantages of Alibaba is the ability to find suppliers offering the best prices in the market. The platform facilitates direct communication with suppliers, allowing you to negotiate and strike the most competitive deals. This price advantage is particularly beneficial for businesses looking to maximize their profit margins or those operating on a tight budget.

Trade Assurance: Alibaba's Trade Assurance feature is a game-changer when it comes to ensuring a secure and trustworthy transaction. With Trade Assurance, buyers are protected against supplier fraud or misrepresentation. The feature provides a safety net by offering full or partial refunds if the products received do not meet the agreed-upon specifications or if the shipment is delayed. This level of assurance adds peace of mind and significantly reduces the risks associated with international trade.

Supplier Verification: Alibaba takes supplier verification seriously, which is crucial when dealing with overseas suppliers. The platform offers various verification badges and certifications that indicate a supplier's reliability, such as Gold Supplier, Onsite Check, and Assessed Supplier. These verification measures help in building trust and confidence in the suppliers you choose to work with.

Communication Tools: Alibaba provides an array of communication tools that simplify the process of contacting and collaborating with suppliers. The platform's messaging system allows for seamless communication, enabling you to discuss product details, negotiate prices, and address any concerns directly with the suppliers. This streamlined communication process saves time and eliminates potential misunderstandings.

In conclusion, Alibaba is undoubtedly the best platform for connecting with suppliers from China and securing the best prices in the market. Its vast supplier network, competitive pricing, and robust Trade Assurance feature make it an ideal choice for businesses of all sizes. The platform's emphasis on supplier verification and efficient communication tools further enhance the overall experience. Whether you're a small business owner or a large corporation, Alibaba provides the resources and security needed to establish fruitful relationships with Chinese suppliers. I highly recommend Alibaba for anyone looking to source products from China."
Very good service. Quick reply. Quick delivery. Firm packing!
Great experience! Thank you!
"The ordering and payment process was professional and easy to follow.
All relevant information was provided quickly and correctly."
"Despite the language problem (Spanish-English), and my lack of experience on the platform, the seller was very helpful in solving technical and logistical problems."
"It was quick, easy, and very helpful."
"All Good Perfect delivery.
Great Experience with Supplier."
I've ordered from many manufacturers here and almost all had great experiences. Over the years the site has improved quite a bit and the manufacturer offering has vastly improved.
Piper has been nothing but helpful and professional. She always replies quickly and has helped us with everything we have requested. We could not be happier with her. Products arrived in a timely manner.
Great service and attention; a friendly experience
"Fast delivery, great product. The manufacturer offers exactly what was required. I plan to continue working with him."
I got many experience working with Chinese companies. More Shenzen company. Respect their work!
"When first placing my order I had learned that the was out of stock, but Mandy went right to work and found another supplier who could supply the triggers and complete my order. This whole experience with Mandy made me feel like I was getting the white glove red carpet treatment. Mandy went out of her way to make sure I was #1.
Mandy is an asset and she is #1 in my book.

Everything was Perfect!!!"
Easy to get quality quotes from quality suppliers. Easy to use. No commitment expected or required
"Alibaba has its ups and downs. they use US dollar which is annoying as between the 3 different countries, the currency exchange is forever changing and they do not alter the prices well. tracking product in transit is poor as they do not have integration to link theirs to Alibaba's tracking details, so, you have to rely on Alibaba Trade assurance if the seller doesn't send you the products. it confirms reciept saying the item has been shipped and you cannot contest it on alibaba. it only extends it. the items you see on a page are not the products they actually sell. so the image you enquire about on their page is a bit of click bait and you have to start the design phase from the very beginning. Alibaba is very behind in customer experience"
"This site is created to steal people's money. $1285 was stolen from me by( Guangzhu Huimei Technology Co,Ltd) and the help center did nothing. I do not recommend dealing with this fake site. I bought a massage machine which worked only for 2 months., be careful from this company, their products are cheap quality"
"I was able to purchased from the Shantou City Chenghai District Ze Cong Plastic Toys Factory a single sample of a very hard to find (in the USA), BLAZE STORM #7082 Manual Pump Toy Blaster. The product was delivered quickly by DHL Express. The product was packaged safely and arrived undamaged. The quality of the product is actually quite excellent. There was complete transparency by the seller agents. Most co-operative and willing to adjust to customer requirements and needed changes. All cost were within acceptable range. This was a very good purchasing experience from this toy seller. Recommend this seller on Alibaba."
Great Experience And Easy to communicate with Suppliers
"This was my first purchase from Alibaba, and I am VERY pleased with the entire experience! Shenzhen Angelina was super helpful when I initially reached out with a request for quote and additional information about the flower wall panels. I purchased this flower wall on 4/24 and received it in 2 boxes on 5/10 and 5/11. This is a set of 2, 8'x4' panels with the flowers and colors exactly as shown in the pictures. A few additional flowers were also included in my shipment in case I need to fill any gaps. I purchased this for my wedding in August, and I am so very excited to use it! Thank you! Overall I would say this is worth the purchase compared to renting at a similar price, or purchasing from other companies for twice the price. Very satisfied!"
"Alibaba doesn't care of buyer but they only care of seller. This is my recent experience. In case dispute happen with your order, this process will run continue till your life, they will not doing anything except asking evidence to upload every 24 hours, can you imagine, I have been uploading more than 12 times still asking to upload. Such a Mad architecture of Alibaba & owner who accepted this process, why? only refund not inisitaed.

Seller : Yiwu Zheweijin E-Commerce Co., Ltd

Please never buy from this seller, he is very close of Alibaba hence if you have any issue then Alibaba will not support you!

Want to buy from above seller - do your own risk."
A pleasure to do business with them. Very attentive. Quick responses. Merchandise is correct and works perfectly. Fast shipping.
The supplier chatted with me until I was absolutely satisfied with the colour I needed. The order was shipped quickly and corresponded exactly to what I expected.
"Ordered a product and it did not turn up by the deadline on the tracking before it is automatically confirmed as delivered, so I requested a refund and went through the process and they sided with the seller saying that it was within the normal delivery time scale, if it can take this long to turn up then why not extend the tracking period before its automatically confirmed as delivered, i have not product and am out 260 quid, I will avoid them from now on"
Extremely quick shipping and the product was just as expected.
Quick to respond to messages and very professional and helpful.
ease of communication with manufacturer quick delivery
This a great site. that is full of plenty of options for what I am looking for. Since I have been using Alibaba I have had an all around great experience. Great customer service who is always more than will to help with any issues that might come up.
The truth is very easy to navigate when it comes to contacting the provider very quickly and online gives more confidence
"Great shopping experience!
I will recommend this seller and Alibaba in general to my friends and family.

Best regards."
"Great people, understandable and quick response"
Great experience. Im so satisfied with the price and the quality of the products.
"Jasmine Wu from Guangzhou Bonroy Cultural Creativity Co., Ltd. was wonderful to work with and answered all of my curly questions quickly. I love the book that was printed for me - it's beautifully made and very high quality. They also allowed me to use recycled paper."
I am very please with the products that I received even though I haven't gone through the whole box yet. It came quickly and customer service answered all my questions every time. Darlene was very friendly and knows the products and business very well which made buying very easy for e because I felt like I could trust her. I will definitely purchase from here again.
Quick and reliable. Sean Gao is good.
"I recently purchased a cream from this company and I must say that I am completely satisfied with my experience. The cream itself is of very high quality and has worked wonders for my client's skin. I have noticed a significant positive feedback from my clients and i also recommend extra improvement to increase the use and quality more.

In addition to the quality of the product, I was also very impressed with the delivery service. The cream arrived promptly and was well-packaged, so it was in perfect condition when it arrived. The company also provided excellent customer service, answering any questions I had promptly and courteously.

The system is very good and guides a new customer well.

"I will recommended strongly this company

"Fast shipping, Quickness with which I find the products, very good communication with the suppliers, and easy navigation on the web."
Great experience. Thank you

"I recently had a great buying experience with a manufacturer on Alibaba. The communication with the manufacturer was prompt, clear, and professional. They provided detailed product information, including pricing, shipping, and packaging options.

Once I placed my order, the manufacturer kept me updated throughout the entire production process, providing regular updates and photos of the products as they were being manufactured. The quality of the products was excellent, and they were delivered on time as promised.

Overall, I was extremely satisfied with my experience with this Alibaba manufacturer. Their communication, attention to detail, and quality of products exceeded my expectations. I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a reliable and trustworthy manufacturer on Alibaba."
"I was fortunate to find a seller that has been extremely kind and helpful! The product cost is perfect for a start-up business, and the product quality is fantastic. I am very impressed with their business practices and how quick the shipping can be! It really depends on the seller. My main seller ships within a couple of days, and the product arrives at my door in roughly a week and a half. They have been kind enough to send me free product samples as well! I very much recommend Alibaba and its affiliates for those who are starting up a business!"
Nicholas and his company were able to help me is so many ways. Very quick response and turnaround to my questions and changes. Very happy with the quality. ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND!!!
We had a negative experience as the incorrect part was sent (not the part number agreed to) however Alibaba did not support the customer or provide protection through Trade Assurance. Alibaba continuously noted that nothing could be done to compel the seller to refund. We returned the part internationally funding the return shipping which has been a costly and lengthy endeavor. The seller has also not been cooperative in clearing the import/receiving the return which Alibaba also has not intervened in. The overall experience has been of a lack of customer support from Alibaba to correct the fraudulent business dealings of the seller.
"Everything is good nice people.
But, it depends on the company, they are required different alibaba fees.There are no standard rules about fee. this is sort of inconvenience.

But the other this are so far so good."
Bob Wilson is always great to deal with. He responds quickly to questions and follows up with any issues from suppliers. The only problems I have had have been in delays in recieving products... which is more of a supply issue than anything Bob has done.
Just as ordered! Shipped quickly! Representative was professional and efficient!
"Delivered as promised. Printer very good professional quality, affordable price and easy to install. Eva is very helpfull and quick answers on questions :) thanx!"
great experience buying large excavator equipment directly from factory .
"I had a very pleasant experience, I like the serious approach that is being applied."
Their customer service really set them apart for me. Winnie Zhang was exceptional in answering questions and providing guidance throughout the entire process.
my supplier made this experience great for me
Another great purchase through Alibaba! Great customer service before ordering and very quick shipment.
This is the worst experience we have ever had. To pay so much for 2 wrong products sent out by this supplier and we can not get this sorted. There is no point having trade assurance when they can t even understand we have been sold and sent wrong items. This has put us off using this platform again. We were very excited to keep looking for new products for our business. Now we know we get sent wrong products and can t do anything about it won t be using again. Will not recommend either. Very disappointed. The products are wrong
"Very professional and positive experience working with this supplier. Nice quality product, fast communications and replies to our questions. Would definately recommend to others."
"Language is not as much of a problem as I had expected, and just requires some patience and basic understanding. The vast number of suppliers accessible through the platform truly make it my one stop shop for product sourcing."
"This was my first experience ordering from Alibaba. I had many doubts about the payment and quality. But the supplier was very helpful and answered all my doubts. Communicated with me frequently to answer all queries. Shared images before dispatch. The order was delivered on time. The quality was good as expected.
The collection of products of Alibaba is endless, you wish for something and you will find it there. Do your due diligence about manufacturer and make payments inside Alibaba to avoid fraud and you are good to go.
The only issue I faced was that, I prepaid the order and shipping cost to the supplier still I was charged the extra amount in the form of customs duty and service charge, of which I was not aware. I was expecting that it will be included in the shipping fee, as the supplier confirmed the same. Seems the supplier was also not aware of the charges, so I would advise checking about the charges in the form of customs duty and service charges at your destination port as they are not included in the payment you will make to the supplier on Alibaba. But the supplier cooperated with me in investigating the extra charges. In the end, the product quality was good and communication with the supplier was very smooth. Hence the extra price is acceptable. I would recommend Alibaba for your business or personal use purchases."
"The customer service from Amanda was excellent and the parts produced from the mold were perfect - all for a price that was among the lowest quotes we received.
All around, an excellent experience."
"First of all, I want say thanks to Respected Ms. Tiffany Chen from the bottom of my heart, she is very nice, kind, cooperative, talented, intelligent, honest lady, thank you so much for your excellent service.

I want to express my heartfelt gratitude for everything you have done for us. Your kindness and generosity have not gone unnoticed, and your hard work and dedication are truly appreciated.

She supported us more than we expected. We had absolutely no idea that we would find such a good company with such good people at the very beginning.

Your professionalism and attention to detail have made my experience with you a pleasure. I am so grateful for all the time and effort you have put into helping us.

You have gone above and beyond to make sure I am satisfied, and for that, I am truly thankful.

Your cheerful attitude and friendly demeanor always brighten up my day. Your contributions to our company are invaluable, and we are lucky to have you.

From the very beginning, you have gone above and beyond to ensure that our needs are met and that we receive the best possible solutions. Your attention to detail, prompt responses, and willingness to accommodate our requests have made working with you an absolute pleasure.

It is clear that you take great pride in your work, and it shows in every aspect of our business relationship. We are grateful for your partnership and look forward to continuing to work together for many years to come.

Thank you for being an amazing vendor and a wonderful person to work with, and thank you for all that you do."
"I love the product (electric bath chair for the disabled people) and the top of the line service.

The delivery was fast, with costumer assistance via WhatsApp and email, I love the experience and the chair is awesome.

I recommend the chair for all the people with motor impairment."
I've experienced good communications with Alibaba and have had no issues with my first two import orders.
The only complaint I have is the review section is too long and requires too much time.
"Easy to deal with, quick and great product,31/3/2023"
"easy and quick communication, very fast shipment."
My overall experience with ordering from Alibaba was good. The vendor assisted me throughout the ordering process and shipping.
"1. So far so good, not bad at all except for one just incident which is known. The very best manufacturer for Me as regards to tablets, ls Shenzhen Carevery Technology Co.

Jackie Li made my buying experience smooth and professional.
"Professional, quick delivery and insured - very happy overall."
"Great experience working with this company for developing a customized exclusive product.
Professional job."
Easy to find products and manufacturers. FOllow up is very useful and all the tools available to connect and exchange requirements and points of view.
"I needed a little larger quantity of product (not a huge quantity)for some custom craft work. Alibaba was able to connect me to a manufacturer that was willing to provide the product and quantity I needed. The pricing was straight forward. With shipping, taxes and any duties included, I was still able to save quite a bit over the resellers. Alibaba promised a delivery date and I received my order almost 2 weeks before the promised delivery date. I expect to use Alibaba's services as needed in the future."
"This was my first order with Alibaba and I must say I was very suprise with the quick shipment, the quality of the product and most importantly the willingness that Alibaba gives to assist the buyers with any issues before, during and after buying."
"I have to congratulate you, I have never received a product so quickly, I congratulate you, I hope it is a quality that will not be lost over time, taking advantage of this instance, I ask you if this delivery with this speed is for any product that I buy with you? .."
Sales staff was very helpful and guided the purchasing process really well. Product is good quality and easy to use.
It gives us easy communication between buyerand supplier. So I can get a quick feedback from suppliers.
Very helpful and friendly customer service. Fast shipping. One of the best buying experiences I've had on this site
"Good day everyone. I had ban experience. Decided to buy TV Samsung, good price, cheap price! Used chat online at Alibaba, manager of Xiamen Duyu Trading Co., Ltd ask watsapp number, I gave. During 10 min, from +905310152350 i received an invoice and request to pay not to company but to a physical person Sergei Scaun at Bank of Georgia, amount 465 eur. After it I received a track number, which can be checked at transitgatxpresslogistics.co, this tracking number not related to DHL, UPS and other world wide logistic companies (fake tracking number and web resource). On the next day I received message from manager, that I have to pay an insurance 1201 eur, which is returnable, of course with Invoice and again to pay to physical person Mariam Beridze at Bank of Georgia. Of course at question, details of insurance company I did not get a clear answer. From my side I inform Alibaba about violators. As well offer to Alibaba personal and professional assistance because this company Xiamen Duyu Trading Co., Ltd not only one. Another one AK ESSENTIALS LIMITED link, officially dissolved at 22 September 2015 according to Company House information. Unfortunately impossible to set a reviews at Alibaba about this companies. No one knows where goes this criminal money to support international terrorism or criminal activity. Please be careful before paying."
"my experience was very good and it was my first time, the representative from the company always replied very fast y replied all my questions"
Alibaba takes customer support and customer experience to a completely different level. The services and options provided by Alibaba simply have no match in today's market and that is why I source as much as possible through them.
Had great experiences with this company so far. Looking forward to continue using them in the future.
"It is very easy to work with vendors, finding quality products. The process of getting necessary information to make purchasing decisions and placing the orders is very quick.

Products are packed with care and arrive on time in great shape."
i have very good experience with all time
This company was helpful and shipped my items quickly. I enjoyed a very good experience with them.
"The overall interaction with the website is easy to use, clear and helpful to get along with suppliers.
Everything is made to give you the easiest experience and give you the best chances to make your trades work."
This experience has been great and has made me feel very comfortable in making deals in the future.
"Easy, no hassle and quick. Great communication and the product looks beautiful. Thank you!"
"What made my experience great was Miruko Zhang, the ability to stay in communication with me even though I'm 12 hrs away was great, I am very respectful for all the service that was given to me the entire time and answering every question I had in a timely professional manner..! Much thanks and appreciation..!"

"First!! Quick response...
I needed faith to deal with overseas clients.
The counselor gave me faith with quick response and expertise."
"Shandong Jieriu Machinery & Equipment: Alibaba,
The Sawmill I recently purchased is surprisingly a great quality saw. The gauge metal used was thicker than I expected.... the shipping was on time as promised, and I will return to purchase another unit (or three) sooner than later! Thanks Jerry @ Shandong Jieriu Machinery & Equipment!
William - USA"
The sales representative was friendly and helpful. The items arrived very quickly and exceeded my expectations. I will definitely be ordering more.
"excellent platform, great products and great suppliers so far has been my experience. Thank you very much. Regards. Juliet."
Alibaba is a scam. They take your money and then you will end up with very low quality product that is completely different than what you promised then you go back to them for their quality assurance program or the quick refund program and they do nothing for you then you end up with garbage product that you paid for and your Chinese supplier doesn't want to see back. They only protect the seller and will screw the buyer every time over and over so I never do business with him if you want to not be screwed.
"My company European Connection Furniture is in business for more than thirty-five years. I brought and shipped hundreds of containers and other goods
From the Alibaba website my search for a freight forwarder I choose one with a pretty competitive rate from his reply to my ad on the Alibaba platform. This particular shipper has excellent reviews published on Alibaba's website and then I decided to ship my factory-ordered goods to the shipper's warehouse in Shenzhen to be shipped to my address in the USA. After the goods were delivered to the company warehouse on October 30, 2022, the shipper increases the shipping rates more than 4 times from the original quote and demanded that I send money without any security to his private account without any invoice from his side. I had hundreds of chats with Alibaba customer service for more than 3 months but they finally refused any help to me, claiming that I need to go direct to the party for any solution. I later found from other complaints websites that this forwarder scammed the same way many other customers in the past and feedback from these customers was not allowed to be placed on Alibaba. For more than two months I was begging Alibaba to let me access the website of the shipper to place just a review about my experience and warn some other potential customers about their practices. Alibaba refused to place my feedback on its website of this particular supplier even after a phone conversation with the manager of the customer service.
It looks like all scammers and fraudsters on the Alibaba website are receiving full protection from Alibaba and customers like me are arrogantly ignored by the company. The reason is probably that they receive a commission from the advertisers and not from the customers. Four and half months have passed and my order is not shipped. I would like to advise all customers of Alibaba not to look at feedback placed on Alibaba websites because they are manipulated by Alibaba policies and are not trustworthy at all."
"My experience has been good so far, but I have left a space for any improvement."
easy to find what i was looking for and quick turn around. quick check out process .
"the best seller of work shoes I am seriously always willing to meet and help solve certain issues
quickly and efficiently"
"Our experience purchasing from suppliers out of country was make simple and easy. I felt we had the protection and processes to be confident in our purchase. We will be continuing to make more orders though more suppliers for our small business in the future, and Alibaba makes it easy and safe!"
It is my first time with Alibaba and it has been a good experience.
Love the number of choices. Easy communication and quick ship.
"Hi I purchased a car radio which was faulty ..
The supplier and Alibaba were unhelpful. What a waste of money.
Do not use these guys as there is no help for the consumer after the purchase.
If I could give a zero rating I would have ..
One of the worst experiences in my life , also spent a lot of time on the computer to reason with them, to no avail."
"I recently had the pleasure of using Alibaba.com for my business needs, and I couldn't be happier with the experience. The platform is incredibly user-friendly, and I was able to easily find and connect with suppliers who offered the products I needed at competitive prices.

One of the features I particularly liked was the ability to filter search results by various criteria, such as product category, supplier type, and location. This made it easy to narrow down my options and find the best suppliers for my needs.

I also appreciated the level of transparency and communication throughout the process. The suppliers I worked with were responsive and provided detailed information about their products and services, which gave me confidence in my purchasing decisions.

Overall, I would highly recommend Alibaba.com to anyone in need of quality products and reliable suppliers. The platform is a great resource for businesses of all sizes, and I will definitely be using it again in the future."
"Ivy Wu, our manager performs so great and shifts our expectations every time we apply for any inquiries. Highest professional level, deep expertise and helpful attitude. Simply the best!!! Thank you, Ivy  "
All perfect. Like in the photos. More quickly than I expectes
"Good quality. Fast delivery. The seller is always in touch, responds quickly."
Amazing experience with a quality product
"Trade Assurance is just a marketing thing and has nothing to do with real customer protection. I ordered two smartphones and explained that I can get them before March 6, the UPS seized these phones and required me to provide an NBTC import license (hah just for two smartphones), the process of getting a license is impossibly hard, long, and complicated, I had no chance to get these phones before March 6. I explained it to the Alibaba dispute team, but they declined my request and did not return the money."
Overall the experience is good but I think the shipping side should be better explained. For beginners the incoterms specification is a bit complicated and many suppliers put DAP service in ready to ship orders. So I believe you should simplify and inform buyers about this kind of service. There is the translation which is correct but sometimes of poor quality. But overall the service and the elements in place are very good.
"Overall very happy with myexperience. Easy to communicate, supplier was very helpful and reliable.Product quality was in mint condition."
Quick delivery and good help during the order procedure
"The website is really user-friendly and you can find almost ererything. Might not be suitable for small order/quantities, depending on the products, but if you're planning/have an online shop, it's the website of choice!"
"This supplier is the BEST I have dealt with on Alibaba , he doesn't make promises he can't keep , he is honest and always quick to reply to questions and help.
If every seller on Alibaba was as good as Frank , then Amazon wouldn't exist."
"Amazing experience, really good products , excellent attention. SAbrina is so great, help me in all the process.
THanks!!"
"I especially want to note the manager Della Qiu, she was very professional, she was always in touch, she answered all the questions very quickly. Everyone liked it very much!"
"Found product we needed, exactly as advertised. Very good overall experience."
The supplier was so gently and quickly responding what was I looked for.
"- Mr and Mrs.
- This is to inform you that I received the scanner and I am very satisfied.
- The purchase was an experience of cooperation on your part.
- Thank you."
Provided all the information. They answered quickly. Quickly sent.
I have a very rewarding experience with Alibaba and my supplier reacted well during the purchase process until delivery. I liked it
i had nice experience with my last purchase..everything went smooth.
"Alibaba is not helping me with the seller not shipping according to the agreement. Alibaba agent Ellie is cooperating on the sellers behalf, and is only taking the sellers side. Ellie keeps pushing the case date with the same response. I have done a lot of buisness on alibaba because of the feeling of the safeness of dealing on alibaba. If this case dont get sorted i will not ever use alibaba as my chinease connection platform.

I am uploading all evidence of supplier shipping on diffrent date as agreed, and goods not arriving before the agreed guarentee arrival date. The alibaba agent says goods arrived before 5x times even though i proved the opposite. Ellie is for no help and have through the case that has been going on for over a month still not called me to find a solution.

Dont matter to use Alibaba for anything else than to find the contact for the supplier. You have no protection when it comes to the end even though you are paying for the service.

I DO NOT RECCOMEND DOING BUISNESS THROUGH ALIBABA. They are pushing out the cases, and supplier has still not shipped batteries for the goods close to 2 months after Agreed delevery date. DO NOT RECCOMEND. Find a agent in china that can do the contact with supplier to be safe, alibaba is not as safe place to do buisess!

Be aware of the suppliers making fake evidence to make it look like they are in the right, and (ALIBABA AGENT) Knows.

BE CAREFULL!"
My experience was very good everything ran smoothly and communication was very clear
"Ordered a sophisticated, programmable electronic gate lock from One Lock from China through Alibaba. Gave it to my locksmith with 40+ years of experience to install and was told it came with absolutely no assembly, install, or programming instructions. He could not do anything with it until he did. Rep for supplier lied repeatedly after multiple requests for instructions and said they were being sent, and never arrived. Finally sent me a 90 second video IN CHINESE. Still no programming info. I started a refund request and supplier refused to accept return or give full refund of $150. Alibaba got involved and was not helpful in any way. I had screenshots of all communications and the short Chinese video. Supplier agreed to $100 refund then apparently changed their mind- Alibaba said they'd give me $60 back and a $40 Alibaba credit. Finally filed a dispute with Visa. Avoid Alibaba and One Lock like the plague- they are crooks."
"In the end it was great! This was my first time buying on Alibaba.com and I made my purchases right before the Lunar New Year. The transactions went through without a hitch, or so I thought until I looked my dashboard the following day. I was confused. Somehow I had to orders for the same item when I intended to only purchase one. I tried using the support function to get rid of one of them. It incorrectly told me to complete the purchase, however I pointed out that the charges had already been taken from my bank. I pressed farther and the system told me to make the purchase anyway and if it was duplicative it would refund automatically. This was all untrue. I followed the direction I was given and completed the second order. Which, I immediately knew was a mistake, so I cancelled the order and unfortunately was at the mercy of the seller to do me right and refund everything. It was a very uncomfortable experience and a couple hours of unnecessary time spent troubleshooting. I know how I'll handle those situations going forward, but using their chat function to try to resolve it was not a great use of my time to get my issue resolved. Lessons learned and I am moving on. Then because of the holiday season, nothing shipped. I wasn't too worried on one of my orders, but on the other the seller had already marked it as shipped and so the 'receive' countdown started while nothing was actually moving. So, I had to use my one receive time extension without knowing whether I would get my order in time or not. It would've been nice if I had the option to pause the receive countdown or one additional extension to account for the Lunar New Year period. It would've meant peace of mind for me. That said once my order started moving it was reassuring, and it did make it with a few days to spare. I was able to fully inspect my item and ensure everything was in order. I was very happy in the end, and my other order should be arriving soon. I am very much looking forward to using Alibaba for future purchases. Thank you so much for a very well thought through platform, and mostly functional customer support system."
Very nice experience - so helpful and our end product was fantastic!
"Great Experience with the Seller from Shantou City Chenghai District Letian Craft Trade Firm
on Alibaba!
Ordered a CADA Building Block Kit, came in its original box, Free shipping with Tracking. Shipping can take a while! At the time of ordering a shipment arrival time-frame is given. In my case it took 29 days (water way). No problem with that as it was well within the shipping time frame!
Great Price as well.
Highly Recommend."
"I've only had positive experiences on Alibaba. I have dealt with over 15 factories/suppliers on the platform and all of them were genuine, attended to my queries and shipped my products on time.

Their trade assurance payment system is also very secure. Until I confirm that I have received my goods or the courier tracking says ""delivered"", I can still receive a full refund.

Keep it up Alibaba!"
Great site. Many Quick Reponses. Sometimes too quick but that a great problem to have.
"Experience was good as the Supplier remained clear, timely & precise. Dispatch was effected very fast via DHL and I even received the item one day earlier than indicated.

Excellent experience !"
"Excellent. The badges and the trade assurances, built trust in me before selecting a supplier. As a first time buyer, this was very reassuring and it paid off. I was able to find an excellent supplier who was super professional and dedicated to providing a stellar product for my company."
"Alibaba always looks for a way to help sellers and not customers, we open a dispute and 4 months later still no solution, alibaba personel won't answer on time, and even when evidence is provided, they will look for other ways ,so you will get cheated. When they know they will loose or when ypu prove you are right, they try to bribe you so you won't take legal action. Worst experience ever"
"quite good, nice"
"The order was sent on time and in full, the packaging is good, the product is intact, there are spare parts and equipment."
"They good support, fast responding and product quality meed as we required."
Quick and Prompt Shipment. Quality of Product is really good.
"From A to Z this company stands out for service and quality. From the people to the products, they are professional. After having some so,so experiences with other vendors, I can not say enough good things about this transaction."
"Very good Interface, well organized for products details and specifications. Very helpful to select manufacture and their products."
"Everything ran OK !
Product received in time (just 3 weeks) !
Product as expected !
Very goood experience"
My experience was great because when I outlined what we wanted they replied promptly with exactly what they could supply. We agreed and then the product was sent. Upon seeing it our team were so pleased!!! We are very grateful indeed!!!
Great experience. Responsive and quality products.
Amazing experience!!! Great product!!! Excellent service!!!
"Wonderful first time experience. I was extremely hesitant to use Alibaba with such a long wait time, but it worked out well for me."
"That's quite a good experience to work with Ningbo Grace. Also for Alibaba, it's lucky to find this supplier with high ability to offer the best price and fast delivery. Nice talk with their sales, quite professional service."
I'm very satisfied with the quality of the bags and the printed logo. They were produced to my exact specifications and shipped quickly!
"Before I trusted Alibaba, I ordered from a vendor directly off their website and honestly, I had a better experience and got better prices with Alibaba than dealing directly with that provider outside of this platform. The vendor I found on Alibaba is excellent to work with. Faster shipping and great customer service."
"The whole experience is a bit overwhelming. The product search is a bit tedious and there is no spell checking on products and many are not spelled correctly, making it difficult to search for the items you want. I haven't used the site many times and maybe it would be easier to use with more experience but it is not a very user friendly site overall for first time users. I did manage to get my order in and received goods. Mostly I think the overall layout of the site could be a little less confusing."
"If you proceed placing an order with one of their sellers you will have to outsmart them, you will need everything in the quotation. Every little detail, that you would think, ""this goes without saying"", NO. It needs saying, like I want the stitching straight on my product, yes, you will have to discuss basic things with the seller. Check every little detail of your order, ask for everything to be added on the quotation, any special requirement you have, put it in writing. Because of course it will arrive wrong, duh. But at least the alibaba dispute team won't refute your case using that excuse. You asked for something, you put in in writing, then maybe they will refund your money if needed. I ordered using their platform, even though I did not receive a quality product and there were missing details I requested, they won't fix it or give me a refund. There can be stains, it can be broken, and it can be really really cheap, they won't assume any responsibility or fix the issue for you. PUT EVERYTHING IN WRITING if you still think its worth it."
the goods arrived very quickly. Corresponds to the description. High quality.

"I am extremely happy with the performance of this supplier. My sales person Karin with the company is absolutely amazing because she is quick to stay on top of all of my needs and makes sure everything is 100% satisfactory with what I ask and she is very quick to do so. She is helpful in every single way and I think the company is very luck to have her as an employee. I couldn't be more happy working her and the company to grow my business. HIGHLY recommend Guangzhou Wenchang Car Appliances Co., Ltd!"
As I live in Australia I was nervous about purchasing items direct from China and I have found the experience easier and quicker than expected. Communications with the manufacturing company and the price including shipping was excellent
"Most suppliers are scammers especially those advertising DJ equipment and Alibaba never helps to retrieve the money back
Please stop trusting suppliers from this platform
They are all scammers
I dealt with 3 suppliers now but I have never received my parcels"
"This is very important to deal with professional people that care I was very satisfied and will continue to do business in a daily basis. Thank you, Luis. Great Rep!"
"I had a good experience with this company and particullary with Peter, I will always use their services in the future"
"Alibaba connects me with suppliers that are thoroughly professional. Thanks to the site I now work with a great printer, and I can recommend quality tools to my industry colleagues. Messaging with companies is easy and paying for orders couldn t be easier. I ve tried numerous times to work with companies on my side of the world but they expect me to compromise on what I need for my business. I don t have that experience with companies on Alibaba."
Quick delivery& Good product.
Always quick to respond. Great customer service. Products are top notch.
"Amazing experience, gently, fast and professional!
Thank you!"
"The supplier is professional with great communication and a pleasure to deal with. The supplier made the transaction seamless, smooth and easy with no problems. The product I purchased is clean and very well constructed. I rate the product 9/10. I would give a 10 but the supplier did not provide instructions or the rubber isolators for the muffler/tailpipe hangers. Overall, a great experience."
"Great platform, great supplier - overall great experience."
"Be extremely cautious with using this site and especially the seller or supplier that you work with. Make sure to look at the reviews. If you are in the US look for reviews from others in the US.

After doing some research on the dispute process on Alibaba.com through the trade assurance, it can be a pretty complicated process to order from suppliers outside of the US. You must be very specific in your specifications of both the merchandise, shipment, quality guarantees and time lines.

You must also make sure to not surrender carrier liability and request that shipment be made when you are at home to receive it. You must also make sure that the external and internal shipping materials are not damaged in any way. If they are take a picture and possibly even refuse the delivery. If there is anything wrong with your merchandise you need to contact the seller or supplier ASAP and begin The refund application. They will likely attempt to tell you that it is damage that occurred through shipping and therefore you will have to create a claim with the carrier. That s why it s very important that if you re using UPS or FedEx that you require the shipment in hand and do not surrender carrier liability by authorizing them to leave it at your door.

The seller or supplier will encourage you to cancel your dispute. Never do that. You will have to make the effort to be extremely thorough in your refund application and provide plenty of evidence.

I m in a dispute process right now and I went in pretty hard on the cellar and threw everything at them and let them know that I believe the seller to be malicious in his dealings with me. This is not like returning something from amazon.com. Please keep that in mind when thinking about using Alibaba.com. I do not recommend buying from seller OUS on that site."
very good company and very easy to work with and extremely good quality products very good experience especially my first time shopping on Alibaba
"I have used Alibaba for one order. As soon as I posted what I wanted, I got offers from several sellers and spent a few days combing through and asking questions. So long as you keep ALL communication on alibaba, I hope your experience will be as good as mine."
"Alibaba Trade Assurance is not working. We ordered samples from the supplier's UK based warehouse. Samples were ok so we placed a big order from China. The products from China were lower quality (unusable) and I asked to return them for a refund. We proposed several ways including returning the products, on our cost, to UK warehouse where they can resell them. The supplier didn't want to hear about a return and Trade Assurance team did everything they could to protect the supplier. In the end they pressured me to take a partial refund and keep the products which I couldn't use.

My experience with Aliaba :
1 - Trade Assurance is not working !
2 - Suppliers will never take responsibility for their mistakes and they do everything they can to make you keep the product you are not happy with."
"I am new to the website Alibaba, and I was terrified to make a purchase, but the executive was really helpful, I would be even more glad if she could understand my language better. But anyhow Alibaba made it simple for me and I loved the service she provided me. It was quick and the product quality is just super excellent. I am glad I found this company on this platform. Now I am rest assure that I am going to do really well in my business and help my people with aesthetic fashion!"

absolute loveüòçüòçexperience best offers always...
Such a pathetic app. It takes month long delivery and cherry on the cake they just deliver to any random person and the order is prepaid. I don't get any call for delivery and I only get a message delivery failed and on the app it shows delivered. I mean how pathetic this is . This is 1st time I've ordered from Nykaa and such horrible experience. Folks do not order from THIS FAKE APP . BE CAREFUL DON'T MAKE PRE-PAID ORDER IF YOU DO . PATHETIC IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT FOR THIS APP .
"Awesome experience,üòÑüòÑüòÑ"
Fantastic hassle free app a great experience
It was a great experience ordering items üòä and must download this app but packaging should be better
All the products that you want ... You'll get it here.. and many more options even. Loving it .. every time the experience gets better and better. Happy
Am happy with the experience. I really love for the wide range of products and safe delivery.
Osm experience
good experience so far
"Bad experience  I've ordered like one shampoo and conditioner from morocconoil brand bcz another app or shopping app doesn't have this brand but they didn't shipped my order they just cancelled it and I just ordered another s&c in another shopping app and they literally came in one week. So nykka doesn't provide good services and even I've ordered so much stuff from here but they didn't shipped my orders they just cancel them.So I requested to shipped my recent order I hope.also I've ordered organix oil and they delivered me a lipstick which is not my order, I'll never buy anything from nykka again and I'm pretty sure. I hated this app + everything."
It has always been a fun experience shopping here! Thankyou Nykaaüñ§
i have good experience with nykka always super fast delivery and original product.
Very disappointed with Nykaa's customer service. I've received damaged products from Nykaa three times and return experience is a true hassle and is not simple with them requesting for multiple photos of damaged products and you having to chase customer care multiple times for the return to be processed and followed up.
It's very helpful in guiding you about the products and it's review. Also offers original products at minimum rate. Enjoyed my experience with nykaa and wish to continue it.
good experience with nykaa
Nice experience
"Recently I had a very bad experience with Nykaa, the product which was delivered to me was not what I had ordered and inspite of getting in touch with them several times ,they have done nothing about it. In fact I have already made a payment for the product ordered which is much more than the wrong product delivered to me. I am feeling very cheated. I would advise not to use this app since they do not bother about what is being delivered or about responding or even having the wrong product exchanged!!!! BAD EXPERIENCE!!"
Pathetic customer service experience. Doesn't listen to the issue and give baseless excuses.
had a Very bad experience with nykaa really disappointed alot . i've ordered for 3products üëâüèªsleek cold Wax ( ordered for super saver pack and recieved mini one ) üëâüèªsleek hot wax ( damaged ) üëâüèªrica avacado no strip wax ( damaged ) This is really disguasting nykaa i want my refund back

Very good experience
I have been using since 2019.but always got fake products. No return possible. Horrible experience....
wonderful experience
Nice shopping experience
"Bad Experience!! Slow service and slow delivery. Since it was my first order, I thought that the products that I've ordered would be delivered by the expected date but they extended upto 4 days from the delivery date."
"Awesome experience. The products I've recieved by far,were all genuine,as compared to the other online/shopping sites like flipcart n snapdeal(although in these sites the discount levels are crazy_hence the duplicate products!) Overall......I m happy with Nykaa."
"I have made multiple purchases from mykaa, today i got one of the product which was non satisfactory and raised a return same day, however, nykaa is not accepting the return stating some policies. Bad experience in case of returning the product"
It's been a wonderful experience shopping with Nykaa. Besides good quality products it's amazing when you receive surprise gifts too. Love you Nykaa.
worst beauty app ever. they dont deliver your pre paid orders and just eat away your money. do not order from nykaa. i ve never had such a bad experience with any other beauty app. and their customer service sucks big time.
Worst experience with nykaa literally you make people fool first of all you told that the area where I have ordered due to restriction you can't deliver there change the address then I have changed the address but still not get my parcel .
Amazing experience and very good service.Products reach on time
experience is great...üòç‚ù§üòäüëå
Amazing experience
Pathetic experience .. ordered the product in sale but am charged the non discounted price.. even after repeated complains there is no resolution .. there is no complaint no issued like in other sites to keep a track .. everytime you call need to explain the issue again and hear dat same would get resolved without any resolution .
Nyc havd a great experience
"I ordered 3 items from Nykaa, and it was my first order. Honestly, I had an amazing experience. All the products were good and original. The delivery was on time as well. I request Nykaa to maintain their quality of service in future. I would love to shop again."
gud experience witb nykaa
Mine experience is always good..thanku nykaa for delivering quality products.
Got wonderful experience on my 1st booking. Loving it.
worst app... experience worst.... i ordered nd then didnt rcvd my parcel...... firstly..... the delivery boy called me more than 29 days after i placed my order.... nd then he told me tgat he will deliver me..... but then not deliverd... nd next day i called him.. he said ur parcel is on another centre.... so i asked that will anyone call me... he told yes.... but no one called me... then after 10 days... nykka called. me... i cmade complain then they told that will shortly send it... but niw.. its been 20 days... but no cLls... no message... no information..... hate blue dart... hate nykka.. do not shop from here.. they dont give your parcel
Had a terrible experience with this app. everything was perfect until I cancelled one order they are not refunding the amount and no proper response i got from the customer care. Despite of checking what's the problem is from their side they are harrasing me that i have a problem with the app or the bank. i wish there were minus stars that i can give to this app
Bad experience üëéüëéüëé looting app i would recommend zero star for poor technical response
Worst customer service. Had a first time experience of wrong product delivered. Called Customer service are but no proper response.
Good experience for nayka....thanku for everything. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
always a great experience üòç
good experience..
This is my first experience to shop from nykaa. Its amazing shopping site which gives maximum discount on products. Love nykaa
behavior of delivery boys is so bad..not satisfied with this online shopping comp...I am so disappointed seriously...very bad experiences ever..
Fabulous shopping experience
it was gr8 experience
Awesome experience. Offers are very less. Discounts are very less.
great experience üòÅ
Buying products from this app has been awesome experience. So many varieties and brands for the same product. Option to choose product which is suitable as well as budget friendly. Thanks Nykaa. Will continue shopping from this app forever.
A wonderful experience..n products r worth for money.....
Worst experience. I will never suggest any one to buy anything from nykka. Nykka deliver short term expiry product in Cosmetic and not receive return order. Even customer care doesn't give proper answer. They declined my return order. Very upset with nykka. I have lost my 4300 rupees. I don't have any words for nykka. Great angerness towards nykka. Stupid people and stupid staff.
worderful experience with nykaa
Mindblowing experience
"Genuine products, decent interface"
Very bad experience. Late in delivering products. No intimation of late products. Will never shop again.
Had the worst delivery experience recently!!! the agent didn't call me...No attempt was made to the my address even after 15 days...though I shopped with nykaa before but nothing like this ever happened...I was just getting messages from nykaa and the delivery partner Bluedart again and again saying delivery failed cz you weren't available....!!! these delivery partners of nykaa are the worst !!!
"love it, super shopping experience"
"Patheticcccccccc!!!!!! Worst experience ever! I odered a pair of lens on 
the sixth of july 2018, one of the lens sachet had no solution the lens had 
been packed that way . Ever since i have been trying to return but the 
customer service is such a joke!!!that i am not sure if am angry or i feel 
like laughing its the 25th of july and the return pick up guy is still 
travelling from the himalayas anyway if u pick a product and u like it 
gooood for you if you dont please dont wait on them to pick it up they are 
as good as our government services . Thank you Nykaaa Lots of love 
(sarcasam overloaded)"
it was a amazing experience with nykaa.
Worst App Very bad and worst experience with Nykaa app and services. Please improve your customer support section.
Overall very good experience üòä
really good experience so far
"I have made an prepaid  order couple of weeks back..firstly, twice i have called customer support but not very helpful..and now also my order is not dispatched even it is showing in the app that it has been shipped. Very poor experience and after receiving the order i will uninstall it right away.."
"One of the stupidest buying experience one can ever have. They have 0 logistics whatsoever. The products are neither being delivered nor money refunded but delivery date extending from 4th to 15th, 19th and now 20th. Please have a look at their reply on their Facebook page."
it's really an awesome experience shopping with nykaa.
very nice experience with fast delivery as well as cheap rates
having a great experience with Nykaa

Such a worst experience... very disappointed from nykaa. I never refer any one . I received defective product and one item is missing but they told me that they vil return and refund but yet no response. And dissatisfied customer support .üò°üò°üò°üò°
Very good experience
Worst experience... delivery agent never calls..u get regular mails that ur package is out for delivery.. Frustrating...bad.. ridiculous app....never recommend or use it again ..they just tend to reschedule ur order...everytime..never ever pay them online before...
superb experience
Always been a good experience!
Never ever trust on the shades of cosmetics they are displaying. I got extremely different shade. And they don't even accept our return request. Very bad experience. I wasted my money. Will never buy from Nykaa.
great experience.... looking for more products
My experience with the product is good but you don't provide such an offer. So that anyobe can easily get the products.
nice experience
Good experience
"Why you announce sales and discounts later when we place the order with prepaid amount, you cancel our order's on your own.. By saying we can't re-deliver order , and we will initiate the refund... Worst experience with nykaa this time"
I love shopping from nykaa coz it's products are super awesome and my experience is always worth it also it is delivered always on time...
"i just love this app. can trust nykaa blindly. the variety of the brands, the interface, it just feels home!!"
"Grt buying experience, smooth app...love it.."
Such a bad experience... Very delay in service and sometimes it cancelled by itself... Never delivered in time even if one pre-paid also.. Sometimes they don't deliver
Good experience so far... two orders on time and the products are as it is on the application... happy to use it... tq
yes the experience was good the products are great and I'm also pleased by their service üòä
"Good and I can't find the estimated delivery date, how shall I find that?, despite this, everything is good and easy interface, I can find every product and its review, no need to rely on Google, I loved it‚ò∫Ô∏è"
very good.user interface..searching product and overall authentic product quality
"nykaa is the best app out there on playstore for buying makeup, skincare, etc etc etc..... my experience with nykaa is tremendous. I have been buying on nykaa for almost 4 years now, ( almost 2 years from my sister's phone, after I got a mobile for myself it's almost 2 and a half years) 100% genuine products, assured and safety, I literally mean it as GENUINE and nobody can give such offers and discounts like nykaa, I bet on this, and being a NYKAA PRIVE member I'm very happy and proud"
awesome experience
Good experience
"Overall nice experience.,Can't recognise which shade to purchase in compact Powder category."

"Worst experience, first time shopping paid online,nothing delivered to me.Please refund my amount Rs 562.I never imagined such a fraud company."
Amazing app with genuine products ..m used to it n never go market for my cosmetic n skin regime ...best place where I can get everything in just a click without any hustle...lots of good experiences with nykaa
very good experience
Having awsome experience shopping with Nykaa. Genuine products and fast delivery.
I am very unhappy with my shopping experience in nykka. My parcel was to be delivered today. I was not at home and the delivery person has delivered the parcel. I am unable to locate my parcel. I have never had such a bad experience with any shopping app. And nykka help was of no help. I would like to know where did my parcel go? And how dare they deliver it without my permission?
I would love to give 5 stars for the app but not willing to give any for the delivery.it is most worst experience with nyaaka .i have canceled my order loosing my patience after 5 days but they had not taken any action even after reporting the issue .the chat is no use and the service center is not at all useful.there is no proper response from both the delivery agent and nyaaka.tracking was not available.
awesome experience in shopping with nykaa
Overall a nice experience.....quality product at one spot...
my experience with nykka is wonderful I love this app. üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç
wrost experience was trying to place my order but order didnt placed but my account get debited twice n not even get back the amount never gonna buy anything from nykaa
I would give it 0 stars Ohh my god it's only 4-5 days i have Installed the app and now the assistant and my order details both are not working and showing something wrong. Delivery boy was so rude that he started shouting that you didn't answer call and very rudely said I won't deliver the product.. Oo.. My god what was this!!! I ordered only one product and shuch bad experiences I won't use this again and recommend you not to use this Instead go to a shop they treat you so well. üôè
Good shopping experience with great offers
"I had order on 19 Oct 2019 few products, till date one of my product was not yet delivered. When I reached out to customer care they told that once we receive that item will deliver it, it been one month and there is no progress.... It's very bad experience to me. Plz Nykaa delivery my product asap."
Awesome experience with nykaa‚úåÔ∏è
my experience has always been very good nykaa... thankyou for great quality products

Never had a bad experience with Myles.
This is one of the best apps for beauty shopping. Extremely satisfied with the user interface. Nykaa always has some or the other offers going on thats y you get best of the prodcuts all the time. With authentic and genuine quality.
Its always an amazing experience with nayka...and the sale is soooooo good...you cannot stop your self from buying this...
"great super fast delivery and amazing consumer experience.. will give 5 stars when you get brands like ABH, fenty, etc in India which are right now not available in Sephora"
"very pathetic experience with nykaa, received a damaged product.. requested for replacement 6 days back.. but they have rejected the. replacement request..!! customer service is very bad,.. very disappointed nykaa üëéüèª"

"Poor customer service by nykaa. I had challenge with my recent order. I'm explaining in detail to assistant. The assistant let me wait for more than 10 minutes. But when I was taking picture of product for sharing they ended the chat. Mary, manpreet and Azaan are the poor assistant experience. Paul was quick and good."
I'm using it last 3-4 years... I never had a bad experience...I have gotten all the products in good condition...even they had sent a bday surprise giftüíú...I love nykaa‚ù§Ô∏è
Very bad experience with nykaa app. Very bad customer service. Delivered damaged product so I returned it and it's been almost 15 days and I haven't got a refund for it. Very bad . I have mailed them so many times yet they are not sending me a refund.
Best experience
Amazing experience!!! I'm obsessed
"good service.. original quality products in it's original price.. only problem I found is that I can't zoom in the page to read the description, reviews and more.. moreover nice shopping experience.. Nykaa.. I'm here again to share about ur packaging.. u really cared for my products. perfect packing. amazingly perfect.. loved it.. I regret I was so late you reach you.."
Sending old and fake products and even dnt take them back.. Worst ever experience..
Even though i had a previous bad experience with nykaa.... Due to delivery problems.... I do enjoy shopping from here as the deals are good... But the customer care is a bit shaggy i would say...
Gud i am the first experience in this app
"Multiple brands , sometimes good deals available. Delivery should be faster. Overall nice experience."
No experience abhi products aane ke bad pta chalega kesi he
my experience is ok
Very good experience
Smooth interface. Tons of options for products.

I never had a bad experience shopping with nykaa
Amazing shopping experience with Nykaa
"My experience with nykaa is great. Fast delivery, excellent products and the best thing is they have really good customer service."
"Sales SCAM by Nykaa! I was a regular customer. My wrost resent experience, that I want to share is that I added products from 0- 40,% discount, but within few minutes while I'm browsing the website they changed the rates of the same products that were in my basket of 40% discount to 35%,20%or straight to zero. I observed it happen not once but multiple times within 24 hours and over the time of 4days. Didn't expect this. Very Disappointed in Nykaa!"
They give false offer and name it technical error.and then some people can order it and quantity shows 6 left....very poor experience......
Nice experience.
Nykaa has to learn to that their delivery chain and customer service is the most important aspect. Have had a horrible experience with the delivery never happening and customer service reps clueless about the status . Refunds are delayed and I am asked to cancel my order in my own and place it again . Terrible experience . Will never shop here again.
Such a horrible shopping experience. They have returned my products without asking me. I've waited for weeks and found out later that they have returned it. Wow! The best part is I haven't received the refund yet. Such a professional dealings!!!! Hell yeah! Beware guys!
Very nice experience
Its a very good app.I loved it.awsome experience.
superb experience
It's my first experience on nykaa but it has really a very good discount which helps a lot.
Really a very good experience..loved the app as it promises quality of the products and there are a lot of options to choose from
my experience with nyka has been good. but could you please reduce the pricing of the product. however I would still love to buy from nyka.
Best experience of online shopping with best quality so farüòä
"As per the experience which i have been observed that, the server respond time of the app is quite long. need to work on this."
awesome experience üëç keep it up #nykaa
Its a great experience shopping with Nykaa.
It's an amazing experience ‚ù§Ô∏èüòç to shop on nykaa totally loved it
wrost experience!! after got the parcel it was totally damaged!
Amazing experience
Always genuine and original products.. great experience always.
I was not disappointed with Nykaa till the date. This time I'm really disappointed because I didn't even get my delivery till now. I have placed my order on 31st May n got a call on 8th June but I was no available at my mobile n also I gave one alternative contact which is my office land line . The delivery man did not even try to contact me there nor 2nd delivery attempt. They keep on telling me he will come n finally the order is back to warehouse. N now I'm calling Nykaa everyday n they are giving me different answers everyday. first they said u vl get by today evening on last Thursday then on same day evening they said no I vl get on Monday. Satday they said it's back to warehouse u have placed a new order.why should I. I have already placed my order m u ppl do not have a good courier please partner to deliver the product. Again I complained they said they vl initiate the shipment again but now again they saying they have to check they are not sure. Seriously I have been using this app since 1 year but this time my experience is worst.
I have till date enjoyed the experience of shopping at nyka. They are prompt with their replies if you have a problem. I find a lot of products in nykaa which otherwise is not easily available in the Indian Market. Keep going nykaaüëç
great experience every time ‚ù§Ô∏è
Very good experience
awesome experience...prpducts are good quality
nice experience
"Do not deliver the orders on time... it was urgent, I text bt no response, a automatic message was deliver everytym which is very irritating. Its my secnd tym I order nd both d tym worst experience for me. They dont bother for ur orders, m out of station today dey r calling me for d delivery. D expected delivry tym was 5th , den they snd msg for failed delivery, nw agn dey r calling for d product. Worst, nd vry irritating."
Great experience with Nykaa.
Its always a great experience shopping with nykaa.....genuine products and trustworthy deliveries..
Worst service experience... Very poor quality products..... Mostly fake product s Very bad customer support.
I had requested for return. Nykaa asked me to send pictures showing tag and invoice. I immediately shared pics. Nykaa replied asking for more pictures. I complied. Then there was no response. So i contacted chat since there is no calling option. This was even worse. Chat fellow or chat-bot kept me on hold for a long time saying they are looking up my details. Then after 15 mins of wait they closed the chat saying that I haven't responded for long. This happened twice. Frustrating experience.
bestest of alll........ I have been shopping from nykaa since 2 years now.... Great experience so far... Amazing deal... Authenticated products..
Great experience ...
Amazing experience

Very bad experience... dnt use this app.. use flipkart. They tell me they didnt accept the product return once product is opened.. worst services...

Very good app for cosmetics purchasing. They sell real products. I have very good experience with nykaa. I loved it...
"I have been shopping from this app since lot of time, it has genuine products and it's a shoppers paradise. It's been a very satisfying experience."
"It was a really really bad experience shoping through this app. They don't mention the most important rules in the product description, you have to go and read thier policy before you shop. The return and refund policy just sucks, just the worse. I really prefer online shopping but i will not refer this app to anyone."
Genuine product & fast delivery. My experience with NYKAA is excellent. Love to browse their app as well.
Smooth experience
I had been shopping from Nykaa since much long. The shopping experience has always been great but just a bit disappointed that they don't run any good loyalty program for their loyal customers other than some loyalty points which are alot much less according to the order size. The only point of disappointment. Rest all good
I had a very bad experience with nykka. I order Vega hair dryer but after receiving that product for some reason I want to return that but they reject my return request. Even my money got stuck with them. And I'm not even using that product. I never recommended this app or never suggest anyone to order something prepaid from nykka. This is a total waste of money and waste of time.
Easy interface . Loving it
Good experience with this aap loving it üòçüòçüòç
Amazing experience everytime
V bad service n bad experience sent damaged product
must shop in nykaa wonderful experience
"Pathetic customers support, Horrible experience with online shopping so far. My order is yet to be delivered from past 10 days, I mailed, chat ,called customer support all are giving the same answer that it is dispatched and will be delivered in 2-3 days. I must tell to Nykaa team if you are not able to handle too many customers then why you are giving offers and trying to attract more customers. Firstly fix what you have and then think of next step."
nice experience
Awesome experience...just love this aap‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
So far experience with nykaa beauty eretail is good. I usually receive orders on time & there are less chances for duplicate products.
So nice experience

"I have a wonderful experience with nykaa ,once i got trouble with nykaa regarding return and refund matter, i was bit angry but it takes time alot then resolved my problem too. Its genuine and promising which makes them different from others."
Great experience shopping with Nykaa...
products are nice.. but didn't have good experience when it comes to delivery of products. sometimes the product is missing or just delay without any update. that makes the customer restless and dissatisfied too
very nice app ..all the brands are very good..my experience till now is going really well üò≥
It was really a gud experience. üòä
Worst experience and pathetic customer service. Whenever I tried to connect with customer service person I will always get a reply that none of our executives are available right now. I would love to rate you negative but I couldn't see that option. Not going to use this app now onwards
"It's a great app I have ever seen, I have ordered so many products and great experience with this aap, always quick delivery and given discounts always.. Happy to have this app in my mobile Thank you üòä"
Coustomer care service worse...dont delv at the given address..so much harassment..dont like it at all..worse experience
The app is great. The offers are irresistible. I loved the experience.
I love nyka it's great bcoz this app show good products and budgeted prices it gives also coupon nd discounts it's delivery is very fast it was a great experience I was order wow hair product at night nd I received next day at evening 4:00 pm so it is too good I recommend use this app.
Very bad service experience. You see the product is out for delivery and they dont deliver it. End of the day the courier service gives reasons like call not picked or consignee was not available. And this has been happening several times. After several calls to customer care you end up cancelling the product. Pathetic.
"Awesome app but does gets stuck at times.I am loving the shopping 
experience via Nykaa"
One of the most trustworthy online shopping platform. I only rely on nykaa for my makeup products. The customer support is also great. Love the experience
wonderful experience with Nykaa. Quick delivery provided by Nykaa. I will recommend to everyone to buy from Nykaaüëç
"I love the app..so many brand,,amazing offers,,super quick delivery,,genuine products..but I wish they should notify us earlier about the upcoming discounts and offers jus like they do on myntra..once I ordered some products on mrp and then the next day I saw flat 25% off the brand ..I got a mini heart attack,,lol...if we know about the sale/haul in advance we can make a list thus having a better shopping experience..plz nykaa do smthing about it"
Terrible experience with the return of the products. For the first time the products was not as expected but these customer service guy is throwing the punchline if the product is tested we cannot return the product. Without opening the package how will u come to know the product is not good. Highly disappointed by the service.
So happy Very good experience
It was a great experience with Nykaa delivering genuine products
I have good experience so far with nykaa app!!! When it comes to buy make up i trust nykaa...

"Fake products, lengthy process of return. Total waste of money. I ordered a Yellow brand handbag n it was of very poor quality. Outside material was so cheap n the chains tht attached to the belt was all black and rusty. Don't waste your time and money. My first experience with them was worst."
I get a almst empty facewash n we can't connect with nyka we can only chat with them how can I send a pik of empty facewash tube . I din't not get nthing so I must say poor poor experience.
"Lovely experience on every time I buy something, on time delivery"
"Awesome experience on nykaa ever,very quick services,thanks team nykaa"
it's so easy to payment......I m happy üòäThanks Google pay for hassle free payment experience....
"Delivery services are disgusting and has been getting worse day by day. They have such a good range of genuine products. I wish they would have their own delivery services. Really Nykaa, you need to get this straight. This has been my 7 delayed experience. Product is in delivery hub since the last 8days yet, it is not delivered to me. Nykaa, this is my last order. They don't actually work on making fast delivery or entertain customer queries with corrective measures. Pathetic"
Excellent experience
wonderful shopping experience. original brands and gr8 discounts..
I'm ordering my all beauty products from this app. it's been a great experience with this app. What i love about this app is that it provides many many varieties of products and even accessories that i ordered and it gives discount and points which we can use in our next purchase. I will continue to use this app. thanks Nyka.
"Never again shop from this website. I had very bad shopping experience with Nykaa. They are terribly bad in delivery,products(selling damaged products),customer support. And Selling product at a price higher than MRP!. I sincerely do not recommend this online shopping site, don't ever buy from Nykaa later you would regret. Its my experience."
It was an absolutely wonderful online shopping experience
Best experience for me i love you nykaa thsnk you so much....üòòüòòüòòüòòüòò
I loved your app this is my first time experience hope to get the product good as seen in the picture..thank you.
I used this app regularly but my last order experience has made me doubtful about future use. My order delivery date was three days ago and till now I have not got my package as the package was sent to some wrong address. I was not contacted from either the courier service or nykaa. And they have not adequately even replied to my queries. I am really disappointed by the way you people treat prepaid orders. It feels like no one is responsible and doesn't even care.
I am having quite good experience with nykaa.
Very nice app with an easy to use and attractive user interface . Its worth using
Very disappointed. Nykaa send me a used product and doesn't provide any refund. Worst experience ever I have with any online shopping app.
amazing experience all i can say.. i love nykaa..
Really mann not satisfied at all.. Wat kind of courier boy..first of all can't come n deliver at the exact place.. N afterwards not even recieving the call...worst experience ever...i think i wl never order anything from u anymore..disgusting....i would never want to see this app anymore... üò†üò†üò†üò†üò°üò°üò°üò°
"It is a very good app. Easy to use, elaborates things properly. Had a great experience shopping here. Must try‚ù§Ô∏è‚úåÔ∏èüèº"
Amazing app. Experience of using nykaas product is really good. Offers are also very good. Really great.
"Great app , always best experience"
awsme experience with nykaa and all the products are available for sure and also it is best store for cosmetics ....
Nice experience with Nykaaüòç
I had a horrible experience. I ordered few products from nykaa and I received the package empty. From November 2018 only I have been continuously calling customer care but of no use. At first they told they will deliver the products again. They didn't. Later they told they will refund the money... Still no signs of any help. It's been 3 months I am trying to get help. But alas no help.
Great experience. Genuine products
Excellent experience
"I had a very bad experience , the pack i recived doesnt have makeup brush that i ordered. The pack contained empty box only. mailed them many times with order number but no reply. other friends told that they do this with prepaid coustmers often. very poor service for such a big name. Will never buy anything again."
Purchase experience is smooth...products are of good quality... Special mention to products of nykaa's own brand... But collection of product should be improved... Many good products are either out of stock all the time or not available.
It's worst experience I ordered on 29/10/18 till now I don't get the order
very nice experience with nykaa....
Very horrible experience My order doesn't deliver me and returned without informing me
My experience with Nykaa is amazing. They deliver their products on time. This app is amazing for purchasing makeup and skin care products.
Great ü§ó experience
good experience
"My experience was amazing with you people, the packing was amazing l loved it so much thank you so much"
Nykaa is the finest aap with great customer experience and it provides best products thank you nykaa
I have a good experience with Nykaa. Nykaa's product are the best. So Fast delivery and also with good condition. Thanks nykaaüòä‚ô•Ô∏è
iam housewife i dont get time to go out and buy my daily essentials from nykaa i have experience a new world of buying my things.i select compare and buy my products.from last one year i purchase my daily need from nykaa.best service.real products.great discount.nykaa is like santa to me.it bring smile on my face.
Worst experience . I ordered an expensive dress and it did not fit me right. While I made the order they did not show any notice of their weird return policy. Now since I am not happy with the product they are not accepting my return and refund request. I am Calling them and sending them so many emails. Very bad experience . Don't buy anything from this site specially expensive stuff . They are not customer friendly.
Great experience
this app is a one stop solution for a girl. user friendly and good quality products found here. my experiences have been good till now.
Worst experience
"Awesome discounts, shopping ease and experience"
very worst app experience
Nykaa... I love u..... Good app.. Every girl shud try Nykaa shopping experience.. üòò
"I just read other reviews and found that many gives one star to the appüòÇüòÇüòÇ. I mean I can't relate. the customer service is not that excellent but I hadn't face any situation that prevails me to give them a star rating. For a people like me who works, but needs efficient time saving app with availability of authentic products is beyond 'thanks'.It's their experiences but personally for me, I appreciate the innovation and my experiences have been indeed a pleasure for me. Hope y'all get better!"
Wonderful experience
"I had purchased many items from here .. Awesome experience . All products are original and lots of amezing offers they provide.. i love nykaa,‚ù§Ô∏è"
"It's been two days that I've been trying to get my replacement approved for a deodrant bottle that's not only leaking but also it's spray isn't working, do you really think anybody would be able to explain this problem through an image. Either the app should include a video option or send some representatives who can check on your behalf whether the product is defective or not. Super late solutions to simple replacement due to defective material. Worst experience."
"They first show you offers regarding some products to lure the customer and when the products are delivered, there is no free product with it. And when you complaint, they just get away saying that the free product might not be available at that time, hence was not delivered. (So why couldn't you just remove the offers when you can't fulfil them?) Worst experience."
Always been a wonderful experience. Nykaa has never let me down. Keep it up Nykaa.
amazing experience
Great experience
good experience
Lovely experience ...nd always satisfied
Always get genuine products...Thanks Nykaa for giving us fabulous online shopping experience.
Ultra wide range of cosmetics at our disposal. Easy and simple user interface. Love it!
My experience for nyka is very good.....believable app....100% original product...thanks nyka
I tried to return a product .I bought wrong size bra for me. However there is a very slow return mechanism . I don't wat investigation they are doing . Asked to upload pictures of product . Pathetic experience . Not a good platform to buy from
"Worst ever! Being a customer! These people have taken it as a joke! I am penning my worst experience here! I ordered my product worth of 924/- In order status, it was showing it to be delivered on 8th Feb 2020! When on 10th I still didn't receive my order, neither any out for delivery message, I reached to customer care of Nykaa These people told me that my order shipment got delayed and said I will be receiving message once it will be out for delivery This block doesn't have space for more"
I ordered maybelline age rewind concealer  but the product is not coming out bad experience   won't order again
Amazing experience
order here u will find 100% best product from m experience üòäüòò
"I orderd for 5 items on Naykaa. But I recieved only 1 item And on order 
detail it is mentioning all 5 items were delivered. As I'm trying to track 
my undelivered items it is not even working always it shows that all 
products were delivered. Very disappointed with it. I'm giving only 1 star 
for these kind of gesture by naykaa team. Worst experienceüëé"
"Best experience with all lovable brands Fast delivery, Nice packaging and authenticity"
I get the best range of products from Nykaa. Thank you Nykaa for the amazing experience.
Referral code unable to use... Bad experience
good experience.....fast delivery as well
Quite satisfied with the app experience. Cutting off a star because lately a lot of products seem to be perenially out of stock. Also the shade range of most complexion products is frankly disappointing. I have come to realise that they often don't carry the full range available from brands.
"I just love the app ,great experience"
Very good experience.quick reaction.every thing is very clear.
It was good experience
Awesome experience.. you can trust this app blindly....
awesome experience form nayika every time I am very satisfied from nykaa
VERY VERY VERY BAD EXPERIENCE..I don't understand why you people are allowing your customer's to place an order if you cannot deliver it to them properly.. before ordering an item I entered my PIN code to that given box below... and it was showing clearly that the item will be delivered to me within 5-6 days..so I placed the order..2 days after the shipment that rubbish courier service company BLUE DART is saying that the order is returned to the shipper.. after that I mailed on your customer's service.. they told me that my order is cancelled... Seriously!!!!!! You people cancelled my order without even informing me...Then what is the point of placing an order on your shopping site..You suppose to tell me this before placing the order.. Even you should not allow me to place an order as it can't be able to be delivered to me.. I placed the order again. Now also it is not showing the tracking details..I mailed your customer's service centre for 4 times.. and guess what!! There is not a single reply I recieved... WORST EXPERIENCE EVER..
great experience.......ü§óü§ó
good experience
Good experience. Genuine products
great experience. I don't need to go for cosmetic and daily beauty care products shopping anymore
awesome experience shopping with nyka and all brands and products you get in this appüòÉüòÉ
Very bad experience. I did prepayment and afer 2 days i got message of order delivered at 9.51PM ..my office is till 6 then to whom they delivered the order. Froud application... never ever shop here
App is very user friendly. Also so far good experience overall
"Fake products, the barcode on products indicates so. It was my first experience with Nykaa. I noticed, they mention high price on products than it's MRP and then apply discount which the product itself provides. I purchased Vaseline which had price of 355 on app and the product itself has discount of 120. I ordered it and noticed the product MRP is actually 235 only. So the discount provided by the company itself on the product isn't passed on to the consumer.  I also purchased loreal conditioner which to me looks fake as it's barcode doesn't indicate originality. When I tried to return your order, this app gets error and even doesn't allow to attach pictures of received order. Anyways, this is my last purchase with Nykaa. I hope I can spread a word."
"I have worst experience with nykaa. It's about one month, neither they are delivering my products nor they are accepting my cancellation request. Their customer service is of no help at all. It doesn't matter how many times you complain, they least bother and never come back. Their customer care person told me he can only initiate refund when they will get products back from courier company. How can I trust that courier company will soon give back products to nykaa. So much waste of time.. fraud at the name of heavy discounts"
My first experience is good.
Worst experience on very first time... i ordered and i got empty box and company doesn't give any satisfactory responses to me.... highly highly disappointed.
Worst experience from nykaa.. Low budget company earning interest from bank amount paid by prepaid customers delaying products delivery.. Fake committments on call given by unprofessional seniors staff. Making fool of customers.. Guys never make payments online always go for cash on delivery. Giving mental harrasments to their customers. Irresponsible nykaa.
Fast delivery is an amazing experience with nykaa
The best shopping experience with nykaa. The quality of products is amazing.
fabulous experience..most importantly products are genuine with best price...üíïüíï‚ù§
Pathetic!! Half of the items are of extremely bad quality with no returning facility. Jewelleries what you get has all different colour from what you see on the app. Not at all a user friendly app with bad customer service. Had a disappointing experience.
nykaa .... is getting bad day by day not even....helpline number can solve or refund issue...they not even delivered my product and not even refunded money ..when I called them they said we have already refunded ..I checked my back account atlest for 4 to 5 time ...no money was refunded ....very bad experience ...
My experience is pretty good with nykaa !! I love their products.
"Excellent beauty shopping app , good experience"
Nice experience every time.
best experience
So far good experience.
Nice experience
"Ridiculous site n delayed delivery...with worst customer service 
experience... Don't trust nykaa ever..."
"Great shopping experience with discount and free goodies ,, Love NAYKAA"
Always Awesome experience !!
I cancelled my product since last 7 days and still no clue about my refund !! Overall bad experience !!üòê
Awsm experience
nice experience
"I love nykaa... Customer since 3yrs.. it is the best cosmetic app you can find! Ive an amazing experience with Nykaa. Products comes fast & well packed, I did not return any item as of now! That's their quality!!"
This is the 2nd time and worst experience with nykaa. I have been a loyal customer since long and u do not provide customer support. I have ordered multiple products and 1 product was missing from the deliveries. U guys are saying that u have dispatched all the products but i haven't got all of them. Either its your fault or your courier service is not trustworthy. And i have to suffer as my money is in loss. U should have provided replacement or refund for the same. Never gonna purchase again.
"Worst site. Delivered me a sealed open foundation and refused to take it 
back. Experienced very rude customer care service. Going to uninstall it. 
WORST SITE, WORST EXPERIENCE"
My overall experience is good...nykaa is reliable site as Products are original here not duplicate
I simply love this app. Makes my shopping experience so easy and hassle free. Love the product selection and best part is the delivery time.
Good experience
"worst experience ever, they take money and then say product is out of stock and o can still see the product in stock since last 3 days. customer support team doesn't know how many days its gonna take they say they are not responsible. sometimes they say it will take 4weeks and then they suggest to go for a refund. total waste of time and mo ney with no customer support"
worst experience with nykaa i ordered some products and prepaid for it n till now i don't receive my order i call everyday to customer care and they also said out of delivery i will nvr recommend this app to anyone
I got a lipstick which had fungus on it really very bad experience with nykaa..I want to return the product and I have emailed them for the same but no response from their side..very bad customer service too..My order no:  # 500450708 pls help me out I want to return the product and want my money back..
i buy makeup brush from nykaa..and that was duplicate product so i want to return the product but they reply due to hygine reason we cancelled your return order....nnot good really bad experience
"Last order experience was bad. i also wrote review on that. this time i ordered few products. it delivered on time. one complementary product they haven't sent in this parcel. they may send later i assume. shampoo bottle was leak, however they have to look at packing part next time. otherwise all ok."
Wonderful experience to find all under one roof! A contented customer since 5 + years! Thank you Nykaa for the genuine products at competetive price! Best app ever!
My experience with nykaa has always been amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è

"Nykaa was my go to app when it comes to cosmetics nd i dint face much issues with the app so far. But now, when I try to return something for the first time ( its a long chain which is not upto the mark its colour is faded nd not useful) they twll mw to upload the pictures nd i did it 4 or 5 times. Still the problem is not solved and their team is repeating the same thing over and over. Customer support is disappointing nd dint get response on time. Very bad experience with thw app."
Worse experience ever ....I ordered few things and it was pre-paid ...now it's more than 10 days but they haven't deliverd it yet .even there customer executive aren't replaying ....I wish I could abuse you guys publicly
good experience...trustworthy
It always has been nice experience with Nykaa
"The most important functionality - order history is not working. My order was delayed and returned due to covid 19, but can't do anything since order history is not available. Neither the app nor the sote is very reliable. Extremely bad experience."
Great experience üíñ
Very good experience. Quality of products is also very nice I'm happy with this app. Thank you nykaaüòò
Worst experience and cheatung products in the name of offers and dispatching empty boxes...

"Worst experience, the coupon is not working."
Awesome experience with nykaa because in covid19 pandemic period it delivered the item in full safety....love you nykaaüíìüíìüòçüòçüòç
One of the worst online shopping experience even.tTry to be a good copycat.
The shopping experience was great and most of their products are excellent. The only thing I wasn't satisfied was when I ordered Bella pany liners. They were horrible. Hadn't expected such inferior quality products from Nykaa. Please discontinue such sub standard products from your products list.
Very bad experience.. Poor service and wrong product provided and not return.. Naykka fake app it makes fool to customers..i would not recommend to use this app for any product...
"It's a trustworthy place to buy products ....... never disappointing..... 
really one of the best experience here..."
Good experience for nykaa
"My experience with nykaa is very good Its is an amazing app, they always deliver the product with a very nice packaging and on time"
Amazing app i am using this app from more then 2 years and my experience was amazing and the best part is that they dont sell duplicates of expensive products..... Loved it
"Nykaa is user-friendly and a very wonderful app for ladies especially. Rather I say and make u feel it's overrated, you must first experience it and then see the difference."
It is an excellent experience. 100% original products genuine and reasonable
Nice experience
"A grand variety of products, good shopping experience."

One of the best app for purchase of beauty products.i really really very impressed with all of its products I've ever purchased from nykaa. This is the most trusted app I have ever experienced. Love you nykaa hope every one will experience the same as of mine as you are too good.
Very grateful experience
"Horrible experience. They are good only till you place the order and after that they don't care whether you get the delivery or refund or not and they will never help only just assurance, uninstalling for life now."
Good experience for cosmetic
Nice experience and very good products
Worst experience
"had a very bad experience with nykaa while placing an order the money was debited twice for the same order and I haven't received my refund the order was placed on 2nd july 2018. I have tried contacting them through emails, customer care etc. but got no good reponse. Its almost gonna be 6 months by now !!!!!!!! ****ing website üò†üò† they are looting the customers"
Pathetic experience.. No cordination of when the order will be delivered.. Every other online players are able to deliver way faster in this phase.. Unfortunately Nykaa is not even bothered to give a reply of when the orders will be delivered.. Its showing its in Bhiwandi and then there is no update!!! Never will buy from Nykaa ever... Truly disappointed!!!!
"Hey Nykaa, I had the worse experience of shopping from your site. I have ordered two products on Innisfree Day, one is complimentary with another and I'm in received of only one product and not two. Yet you have stated in my Nykaa account that it has been delivered. Do you have any proof to claim the same? Have complained about the same through the nykaa review on mail but I haven't heard from you so far. Deliver the product or refund my money ASAP!!"
Not gud experience shipping is not gud üòëüòëüòë
Wow Nykaa! Loving my shopping experience üòÄüòÄüòÄ
It has been wonderful experience shopping skincare and cosmetics from Nykaa.. Always Genuine products .... Seasonal sales at times are cherry on the cake..
Good experience while shopping...
worse customer service ever I have experienced in my life. rep over the phone was not able to help me because they were not able to track the order and they hung up the call 9 times without even responding to me. I wrote an email as well to the nykaa team and one of the rep call me regarding that email and said that he will follow up my order and will call me back next day to comfirm if I have received the order. But again there was no call and I did not receive the order within the time.
Very good service..products are reasonable and products are delivered on time. Good app for make-up lovers and hair products are good. User friendly UI. Good experience so far to shop from this app.
My experience was very nice. The products are very much best.
Overall experience was average and navigation around the website was smooth enough.
nice experience as well as fast delivery...loved it
very good experience
Nice experience
I just love nykaa ..Best shopping site ever experienced
"Really Disappointed with the Nykaa team. The application shows some offers (having no mentioned terms and conditions) but offers do not get applied to your Cart. Keep complaining and all would be in vain. My Personal experience would suggest everyone to make sure that if you buy any product that has offers, go and check your cart twice before placing order to make sure that offer comes up in the cart as well and not just product display page."
I ordered some products before 10 day I haven't received yet it's sach long and there's no responses from the service. An very bad experience. It's really bad for me
Very bad shopping experience with this site... The worst site i have ever been through.. They don't deliver at time neither refund at time
Very good experience
i m waiting for experience
Literally got a duplicate lipstick worst experience ever...
"Worst experience... I ordered two products..worth Rs 468. Not even single product delivered... One was shown delivered firstly.. Another price was refunded, Then after complaining they are refunding.. My whole amount..that makes 398....why amount was deducted... If i didn't see any product at home... I do not recommend using nykaa.. Pathetic customer service."
Super experience for the first orderüòçthank u nykaa
Wonderful experience... All the products of nykaa are very good quality...
"Nykaa is one stop destination for all skin essentials and i throughout loved the experience of it. Great delivery, prices and genuine products. I must recommend it."
Wonderful experience shopping with nykaa at such amazing price range. Nykaa provides experience like no other online site could.
"Very bad service from nykas totally disappointed from delivery. I shop some 
products before 2 weeks and it didn't deliver till now.very worst 
experience.i will not buy anything from nykaa in future definitely"
"amazing app for cosmetics, body care, hair care products if anyone haven't used it plzz go for it you'll get best results,it was a great experience with nykaa... nykaalove‚ù§"
"The interface is very good, precise filters and easy navigation. Very fast payment procedures but if u want to cancel or refund the product you cannot do it from app instead you have to mail the support which do not reply fast. I like Nykka for products but app can get much better."
I have got wrong product and I'm sending u mail again n again for cancellation wrong product deliver but u all are not taking any action u all rights not serious about customer complaints today iz 5 day and I m again trying to contact u but u all haven't answered anythng worst experience with nykaa I m trying to contact u last 5 days but I can't contact whenever I want to keep details and images it shows error file iz too long my file is only 2 mb and u all have written file must me upto 5mb not more than...
Wow experience with nykaa... Got everything I want
Very bad experience! ordered my 6-7 products and they couldn't delivered my products. nd giving excuse that when will having work in that very location den it will get delivered..such a pathetic service they are having can't believe..
lovely products... great shopping experience
Awesome experience
"I am not someone who usually writes reviews. But it was a very disappointing customer service experience for a purchase I have made where I required a gift order with multiple items. Post making the order and the payment, it was informed each item will be dispatched seperately cos items come from different warehouse and they have no way of merging it. Disappointing and very poor customer service where they won't even think of a solution."
"Shopping through Nykaa app was of good experience, waitinf for the delivery to happen"
Super experience and more offers keep shopping with Nayka

Great experience of shopping with Nykaa
This site provide you genuine products and they give you offers on that too. Great experience till date.
Worst experience
"Love the app. The interface is topnotch, the production collection is extensive, the shopping experience is very pleasant."
"My experience with nykaa is very awesomeüëè‚úäüëç because of fast delivery, I'm really impressed because I'm going to out of town and delivery for the product is after 2 days but I call üìûto nykaa customer care number and they provide product next day which was very impressive üòáüòáüòáthanks to all nykaa customer service nd team üòáüòáüòáüòá"
"Worst experience from nykaa.. It took some minutes to load.. And the worst part is the delivery.. I have ordered on 1st October 2017 and today is 16th October, still i haven't received.. I have ordered from ebay on same day and they delivered to me within 5 days via aramex.. I will never buy anything from nykaa ever.. Amazon, Flipkart and ebay are much better than nykaa, and they gives discounts better than nykaa.."
It has a great user interface and is convenient
Great experience :)üòä
Beautiful experience

Good experience
"Very bad experience. Hate it. Had ordered two lipsticks. However, the shade they show online is completely different from the shades they deliver. Had ordered two lipsticks that veered towards a red shade. But what I got was one in neon pink and another in orange. They do not portray the actual shade in the website. Felt deceived as a customer. Highly disappointed, will never shop from Nykaa again."
My first experience was extremely very good i love this aap its easy and have clearly described all products which helps me to choose thank you nykaa
Wondrful experience
Great experience jst loved it mynykaa

Amazing experience...evertime I purchase.
It has always been good experience shopping from nykaa for make up products.
Worst experience ever on an online shopping site received all the leaked products and not giving response
i had a very good experience of being member of nykaa family ..thanks nykaa for providing such a good service to us..
Great experience on nykaa purchase
"nice experience. genuine products, on time delivery, superb packing. Keep it up Nykaa team. Please add  some international makeup brands to your range."
it was a nice experience but the only thing which disappointed me was i tried to exchange a product but was not successful n this happened only once wen i really wanted to exchange it
Very good experience
Great app to shop for all the beauty products. They have a very good range of brands and awesome discounts on the products. Nykaa does fastest delivery without any additional membership and their packaging is very great. Overall had a very great experience with Nykaa.
The whole app experience is really good.All the products that I received till now has been of great quality and delivered with absolute safety.
It's good experience to shop with nykka
"Had a very bad experience with nykaa, received a wrong product but no response, customer support is very weak."
Wonderful experience...love the nykaa sales.best products at very good prices and exciting gifts ...
Good experience!
"thank u for the response, and I recently ordered another product of ""kama ayurveda"" I hope it will a good experience for me."
Good experience
"Worst experience ever, never witnessed such a slow and delayed delivery. I placed my order on 13th August and it showed the expected delivery as 15th August. On 15th August the expected delivery changed to 19th August. On 19th it changed to 21st and now it is showing 23rd. Is it a joke?"
great experience
Grateful for this app...its an amazing Experience for shopping with discount pricesüòá and every kind of payment method....Thnx NYKAüòç
Overall good experience
Bad experience. It has been over 12 days and still didn't receive my order.
Amazing experience... With nyka it's been a long time i m purchasing the products frm nyka a true n genuine products....
Worst experience ever nykaa does not reply to their customers complaints...charges money for products and doesn't deliver complete item that you order...
On of the best app for Cosmetics. Many time order products from this app always have good experience. They always give u good offers. Keep it up gyz
Worst experience
best experience i had while shopping got so many products in lesser price
"Poor very Poor service  I ordered boutique hair oil 800ml. I received a broken seal and the oil was all out from packing. It was my first experience with you people and you made it worst. Previously I use to order it from purplle. But this time I tried Nykaa. But you made it worse, you people service is very bad. I will never give you a second chance. You people are cheat. Fraud. If I get a chance to give you a feedback. I'll give you very very negative feedback.¬† worse poor fraud cheat Nykaa!!! !  I hate it.¬†"
Great experience with this app.there is affordable range of makeup products and great deals.100% genuine products.
"well true review :- my wife told me download nyka and look for lupstik and kurta...one of the worst userinterface aap , i think this app is for the bollywood starr or rich people who biys premium products ...they arr making fool of the people by showing fake discount ...i will recommend people to avoid these kind app ."
Nice experience
The user interface of this app is very intuituve and perfect for buying/browsing makeup products.
Awsmmm experience with nykaa
Amazing online buying experience
Its gud experience buying my cosmetic from Nykaa as u get every brand and every product very easily without any hassel and at ur doorsteps.
GOOD EXPERIENCE
"I use to luv this app n purchased lot frm here, but my recent purchase was worst experience... I use to trust authenticity of thr products but got a fake product, by looking at packing any one can say its not original product such a wastage of money. I reviewed that product thrice with picture even so that others can know n stop wasting thr money, but they are just not showing my review very disappointed. Never going to buy any product from here n won't recommend anyone anymore tht I used to luv"
Nice experience. Good product.
Good experience
nice experience...delivery on time...products r also good & cheap too than others
"I'm a Nykaa Priv√© member. In my experience, it's great for purchase of skin/hair care products. But in case of make up products,it almost always sends expired products or products very close to expiry, like 3 products manufactured in 2015 were sent to me in Nov 2017. They put up paper stickers on the product which shows a false expiry date which is sometimes as far as 6 years from the date of manufacture! That happened in casof my mascara. Only the printed date on the product itself is to be trusted."
My experience with this app is absolutely great. Awsome offer and fast shipping and delivery. Everything a girl/women need is available here .
This app has great products at reasonable price. Everytime I love to do shopping here.All my cosmetic hunts end her. Thank you for a great experience üòä
wonderful experience with nykaa.... with the surety of original products
I am using this app for past 1year & my experience is always good... Whenever I have queries they always give time & solve it as soon as possible.
Bad experience.plz don't install this app & waste your time and data . it's a useless app shopping from this app means waste your time and data .chat service of this app is also useless and couries service of this app is also very poor.... uninstall this app... Bad experience.
Always a lovely Experience shopping at Nykaa. Hassle free and good discount.
There delivery service is very poor... After waiting for about 10 days i had to cancel my order because delivery boy refused to deliver at my place.... And customer care was of no use...Worst experience!
Its always a fun experience with nykaa.... yu always end up buying more bcause of the amazing deals going on.
My experience regarding these nykaa aap is very amazing.
Nice experience
My go to app for cosmetics abd body care products. The products delivered are genuine almost always if I remember correctly. Application: Simple and elegant interface. Works pretty smoothly too.
Very good experience has been done..
Very good experience with nyka. Great products
"Worst experience, my product was returned without delivering it, irresponsible behaviour by the delivery boy, inexperienced fellow. And your costomer care person called and said he will deliver my product within 24 -48 hrs, it's been 3 days yet u haven't received, when I checked about my order in app it's return , you people tell us you will deliver but u do this behind us. Shame on you guys, actually zero stars I wanna keep for this app."
Very simple user interface and great collection of products
My experience with Nykaa has been amazing so far .
I bought so many products from nykaa.  Because there was huge discount on almost everything. But as soon as I received my order I got so disappointed. Most of the products were half in the quantity. The quantity which was mentioned on the product was 40 ml. But the bottle was half empty.  It was the case with almost all the products I received.  I was so upset spending my money on shopping from nykaa.  Bad experience.
"Products are genuine and so far my experience has been good. Their service has improved, delivery is faster and products are being delivered in far more protective manner"
Good experience
Great experience with you . Thank you NAYKAA

"Pathetic, made me wait for an order for more than 10 days. I kept on writing to them and told me that they will get back in 24-48hrs this kept on going for 10 days, today as I am writing this I still have not received any order or resolution. Very bad experience"
It is very good app.All valued products to buy.Great experience.
Very bad experience and very bad costumer service.. They delivered a defective product and when I ask to return and refund my money they didn't respond and now it is showing that the return period is over.... I contact immediately nakyaa after they delivered defective product........ But no use....
"Have ordered for the first time. App experience was good, let's see ..."

Good experience on my 1st order.
worst experience üò°. worst serviceüëéüëé. Fraud company. My first experience was ok but after that the delivery man returns the even without even asking. They lie to the customers. Products are good and genuine. But the delivery service made my experience worst.
Amazing stuff and amazing experience ... Looking forwad to shop more
First time experience with nykaa is veryyy goodd ..noww wait for my products delivery üòò
Good experience
the experience is amazing with every shopping in nykaa. loved it
Good experience
Amazing Experience üòä always
Though have just started using NYkAA.. its been a feasible experience till now.. though discounts are no as much as compared to other app ..still i prefer to buy as products are genuine..
Pathetic experience... Order delivery status not updated for two weeks just to avoid the use of Return Policy...
Not trust worthy. I have paid 543 rupees for my order but I didn't recieve the product. Till now they have not refund my money. It is really very bad experience from this website.
Seemless Shopping experience. Love it very much.
Genuine product fast delivery.. great shopping experience... nyka is my bae.. I love you nyka‚ô•Ô∏è
"Using the app since 6 months, it has been a very good experience. Order and payment process is very clear and fast. Good job Team Nykaa!"
Very bad experience they dont even bother to reply they cancel order neither they refund nor they inform not expected
"worst experience ever. i have specially ordered nykaa voucher of 1000 rs each but nykaa has the system to use only once at a time. so you have to choose product which is of 1000 rs only at a time according to nykaa system. No solution for this. I have to post this on twitter, Instargram and Face book and everywhere as this is completely unprofessional. people should aware about the fact that if they have points on their credit card or anywhere else. Never ever buy Nykaa vouchers."
Nice experience. Good deleiveries. Almost all products of all brands available
I have the best experience for shopping at nykaa.. it always has amazing offers to avail... In one month get 2-3 boxes delivered to my place.. For me its nykaa always
First purchase on nykaa Lets c how is my experience ü§û
Shipment lost.. I have ordered some products many days ago but not delivered till this date. Now when I tracked the delivery it is showing the shipment is Lost. I made a complaint so many times but no satisfaction till this date. I did not get my refund too. Worst shopping experience of my life. Giving it 1 star.
Products are very good. Delivery are very good. Happy Customer. Huge varieties of Makeup products. I am regular using Nykaa Milk cream. Experience is good.
"Always an Amazing experience while shopping on Nykaa, they have great collections and categories, which give you innumerable options to choose the right one !"
Excellent experience.. Right place for genuine shopping

"ùü¨ ùòÄùòÅùóÆùóøùòÄ! My first experience with Nykaa's been a nightmare.I've been shopping online for a long time and never had any problem.After a few recommendations, i ordered few products from nykaa. Order placement and payment was carried out smoothly but, delivery part couldn't get any worse.I ordered 3 items, out of which, one never got confirmed by the seller so, I had to cancel it and Nykaa made me return the remaining 2 on it's own & I haven't been refunded yet. Ever heard of consumer rights?"

"services like hell ..ordered an eyeshadow palette of shade 03 ang got 01, and on returning they charge you 50 rs.from your akount for their mistake ,other apps dont really charge for incorrect order and even there is no exchange policy ....worst experience ..just had variety if items but services are very bad .."

"Nayak's app is also useless and its delivery partner. 3 days ago, two item out of which one items were broken and the product is leaked in the package. The most useless experience in the app the track button is just to see it does not work at all they Don't even deserve 1 star for there delivery and for there app. Who so ever is reading my review I suggest you not to buy anything from nykaa It disappoint you with there product and delivery. The worst experience ever i had"
"This is my 5th time where I had such a bad experience again. It's been 15 days since I get this message my order is delayed, I can't even cancel the order and I have no idea when the hell is my order going to be delivered. Products are nice but delivery sucks real bad!!! I hope someone authorised person reads this and hopefully I'll get my order before this year ends"
wow experience üòçüòçüòçthx nayka
Always a grt experience being at this site.its a one stop location for all the beauty needs.love u nyka.
Great experience love it ‚ù§
"By far, the best shopping experience for me has been from Nykaa. The cosmetic range and the brands that it has, I don't think any other app can cover it. Not only this, the delivery and product quality is also up to the mark and highly satisfactory! Good going, Nykaa!"
Good quality genuine products.. safely packed quick delivery. Very good experience with nykaaüëç
great experience
One of the worse experience I have ever had I order many products from nykaa and I got 2 damaged lipstick.. though posting the pictures of them they didn't gave the replacement or the payment back .. I will never use this app again
nice experience.
I ordered first time thru nykaa and my first experience is the worst experience. from 23rd july my orders are still getting delivered. every day i get the sms of failed delivery and I can say for sure that there has been no attempts made to deliver the order. have raised this concern thru chat and email support but their customer service is lousy. pathetic service ever. no action is taken inspite of raising the concern.
Very good experience with nykaa
I ordered a shampoo and anti frizz cream.the shampoos cap was broken and the cap of the cream was not working so I had to open the cap and then use the cream which I found to be half in volume. It's better to buy cosmetics from a store than to buy it from this site. A bad second  experience I would say. Only my nail paints were fine. Overall a bad experience knly
Good experience
good experience
Very pleasant experience
Complete app for makeup lovers. Loved the User interface of app. very smooth processing and great offers
Great shopping experience with Nykaa!
This is the worst app for returning the product They just cancel the return request on their own without even informing the customer. Very awful experience
Easy experience.Good product delivery
Good experience
love the shopping experience. especially the sale deals are superb!!!
Very bad experience I placed an order on pink Friday sale and it's around 1 month I didn't get my order whenever I call customer care executive they cut my call they don't even refund my money very bad service!
"Simple user interface, good information about lots of products, product 
reviews inbuilt into the UI."
"very fast delivery, good experience, very happy"
"Wonderfull experience , The sells are excellent !! All the products i have bought yet are awesome M loving it!!!!üòòüòòüòòüòò"
Bad experience..I had ordered faces foundation and I got faces lipstick in the box of faces foundation.
"OMG. Is this app a girl's best friend or what? I've never encountered any 
bugs or any down time. The app works as smoothly as applying butter to 
toast. The user experience is great. The customer service is fantastic. And 
the products are exactly what you see. If this is not enough to get you 
hooked, the insane variety and brands should definitely get you here. Much 
love to Team Nykaa üòò"
no idia why these people deliver soo late ...on other websites you can get the order within 2 to 3 days lots of time they have taken and still out of multiple product of mine only one product is ready to deliver and yet noo delivery had done...i just choosen this app bcoz rates are little less ...otherwise worst service they provide ...noo linkup to customer care department last experience was also not that good ....soo my advice is if you have lots of pateince then only go for this app...
Although experience uptill now is good but today ordered for new products based on reviews....my fingers are crossed.. hopefully results r gud for al
I had very bad shopping experience with nykaa 3rd time . They never delivered a free gift to me . Always cancelled the order after shipment. And even this times their support team not helped me out . They are not ready to back my money even not getting a any resolution . Only said that we are not accpeting any cancellation this time . Thand hoe can you cancelled the free item . I already done thrice but nobody is reverting on mail . Even your agent nayab and elwin try to misguid me.
"very bad experience with this app. they give discounts because they sell 
expired or about to expire cosmetics. I ordered 3 times and got damaged 
products."
Nykaa app makes shopping easier and hassle-free. Liked the overall experience using the App.
Grt experience to shop with nykaa
Worst online shopping experience ever. Their return policy is so long and complicated. They tell you that you can return the product within 5 days if you have not used it but when i tried to return it with original packing without even trying it they did not approve my return request the kept asking for pics of the product over and over again. NEVER GONNA BUY FROM NYKAA EVER AGAIN.
"The delivery can sometimes get delayed and annoying, but otherwise I've had great experience from the app"
It's a good experience with shopping from this site. All the products are original. Packaging is also very good. Quite satisfy with this app.üòä
Really great experience with nykaa.. thank you nakaa..üòòüòò
"The experience was very bad. I ordered a product which was shown as available but wasn't there in their stock. Its only after a week of placing the order they inform me that its not available, that too after raising a complaint. And guess what? that product is still showing as available."
Its wonderful experience with you nykaaüòä
Over all experience with nykaa is great... And with years gone by it has become part of every girl and women. Thank you nyka for getting everything under one roof
Grt experience with nykaa. I m very mch satisfied..üòä
I have had the best experience with Nykka! The only reason of rating this app 4 is because even though the vendor is same then also the delivery of products happens in separate packages. Not sure why.
Vry nyc experience
Very bad experience i have reqested to retun or replace my product from last 5 days i didnt get any reply from nykaa
Had good experience with nykaa.. Keep it up
great experience and lots of options
"Excellent online shopping experience... There r so much discounts on 
products... Love to shop through Nykaa... Feels HappyüòÉ"
shopping experience is very good. But delivery is very bad in fact worst service in terms of delivery. Refund also very poor

such a wonderful experience..it was my first experience to go for online shopping..just amazing..i recommend all to buy ur cosmetics from nykaa.üòçüòç
It was a great experience shopping with nykaa
best shopping experience
Worst experience ever! I bought lakme cc cream from nykaa and they sent me an empty tube with no product in it and without any seal..this is rhe worst online shopping experience ever i usually buy products from flipkart and I'm gonna stick on to that again and i don't understand nykaa's return policy as well i mean how am i supposed to return the product with seal if it came without one????
"It wasnt a good experience with some products, but later found that ordering cosmetics here is a good deal. They are original and offer good value"
Always happy with the experience of shopping with u..loved this app
In Last purchase I had bad experience both eye shawdow pallet and lipstick was broken Hope this time I will get my items in good condition. Overall shopping experience is good but Nykaa has to more concentrate on delivery of items in good condition
Worst experience ever cant return a product which is disappointing üòï very pathetic service
"Amazing deals, great service and on time delivery. Nyka gives an amazing shopping experience."
Great experience
I love shopping with nyka ‚ù§Ô∏è till date experience is good and delivery has always been on time
Bahut hi bura experience raha mera nykaa se mera oder 3 day me aane wala tha par vo 1 week ke bad me bhi nahi aay to mene cancelled karaya bad me refund ke liye bola mene mujhe pure 1nd half month hoga par mera refund nahi aaya nd call karu to bolte hai ki mem nhai hamari tarf se to hamne pay kar diya hai such bed experience ....

I am a new customer. For the first time ordered on this app. I will update my review only if i get a satisfactory experience.

"It has been a great experience with Nykaa, Everyhting comes nicely packed and with best products Thank you nykaa"
its incredible experience for makeup lover...
"A really disappointing and irresponsible behavior from the Nykaa team. Returns are never initiated and if they get initiated it is really really late. The delivery service is worst. Products are good but had a really bad experience with the help center, return related issues and delivery issues."
Amazing Experience ...just love this app
Good user experience
Very good experience....... Love you nykaa... üòòüòòüòòüòò
Wow experience .. Quick delivery .. fine..
Worst online shopping experience ever Worst quality products they don't provide return to returnable products saying corona is there while delivering the product they don't have corona issues i guess i tried to contact them but no response was shown and they just cancelled the product return
nice shopping experience
Good shopping experience
"My first order with Nykaa wasn't a good experience. Their customer support is difficult to get across to. Their automated customer support has two options, product return or replacement. When my issue was elaborated, their apology mail was automated as well. The issue was about Nykaa eyeliners which by default don't come with a seal. It's disappointing that basic products such as hairpins were sent in a sealed box but their in-house eyeliners had no seal."
"Worst experience ever They take your money and make you cry for your own money if you ask for a refund, been saying they have refunded my amount but mh bank statement has no info about their refund and then they say please ask your bank, why should i ask my bank if you haven't even refunded my own damn money!!!! Don't buy from this scam application. Such bad refund policies and such a bad customer care."
Worst experience üò£..I have ordered 5 days before and I haven't received any of message or notification for my order. Aslo I have paid full amount. Yet I have no information for my order. please refund my money
Very good experience
"It's a nice experience, getting all affordable as well as luxe brands under one roof.. Timely shipping and proper packaging ‚ù§ And yeah, the popping offers keep me hooked!! Bravo Nykaa team üíï"
I had good experience with nayka...bt recently i face problms with my product and wish to return it bt they cancl my request and did nor approve .. this is so disapointing...next tyme i will thought twice before order something or maybe never order from nayka again.
Great experience üëç
Amazing experience. Best offers.
Happy ever after.. downloading this app. I dont even buy a smallest thing from outside now.All from Nykaa..loved the experience...
Good experience
"I can't login to my account. I had good experience with Nykaa in past but now the app is problematic. Everytime it says ""We are facing some internal error. Kindly try again after some time"". This is happening since more than a month now. Could you please resolve the technical error since many others are also having the same issue."

"Best app for original and genuine services...easy delivery easy return policy are really helpful ,price and offers are really amazing ...nykaa has made my beauty and skin regimen experience super easy and luxurious...thank yu nykaa."
"App is horribly slow in loading. When i tried to check the lipstick shades using skin tone, i got a blank screen. Sometime the skin tone loads, the lipstick shades doesn't load and vice versa...horrible experience.. i tried to check lipstick shades many times but the page is not working at all.."
good experience
First time I'm buying the product from Nykaa. Hope It Will be Great Experience and It doesn't Disappoint me.

What can I say.... it's always a nice experience shopping with nykaa
"Awesome shopping experience... genuine products, good customer service.. personally luv it.."
Its my lovely experience being a part of the nykaa family . i am happy and i love shopping
excellent experience
awesome experience. loved it.
I really love this and I am having 2nd experience with it and I think one should try this
amazing experience shopping with nykaa
Worst experience .. Return and Refund policy is worst.I was trying to connect with support but there is no customer support..Not Recommended
lt is a nice experience to shopping with nykaa. 100% genuine products worth for money. People should try it.
Nice experience
shopping with nykaa is a very bad experience...u get many spam calls from nykaa ..u never get responce for you feedback...i would never prefer again this shopping app
best experience with nayka
One of the best beauty shopping app.. Nykaa has all genuine and original products. Using since last 2 years and had a very great experience ‚ù§üòòüòò
this app is a one stop solution to several problems and requirements of women. It has made the shopping experience all the more easy and enjoyable.
Fabulous experience while shopping amazing quality products
I would have given nykaa 5 star but my problem is their courier service (delhivery courier service). Worst courier service I'v ever experienced. Nykaa should change into some other courier service for delivery iff nykka don want to loose their customers just b'cause of a courier service. Otherwise 5 star for nykaa's products.
Good shopping experience....all products under one roof
Horrible experience beware of buying The company oral b provides 2 years warranty but don't fall into the trap. My toothbrush went off after 14 days . I am trying to contact both oral b and nykaa both in vain. Nykaa sells fake defective products. Beware of buying from here.
Hi Nykaa I had previously rated you 5 but having a bad experience at the moment. There was an offer were on purchase of products worth 1200 you get a lipstick free and I did not receive it. And you revert to my complaint saying offers keep changing. I know offers change but you know what offer you had on the day I placed my order. So why cant you just fulfill that instead of mail over mail!??
very bad app they send you defective product with ezy replacement or return.. but when you orderd and get anything bad or defective they hold your return from week and then they cancled.. better go with another app or product.. i am shoping from this app more than a year.they were good before. but recently acording to their rating they stated ignoring and reject repacement and return very very very bad e experience for the second time ü§¨üò°üò°üò°
"awesome experience,love this appüòòüòò"
Very bad experience. My delivery date was 11march still I didn't get my order yet. Whenever I call to the customer care they say u will get ur parcel in 24-48hrs. N also I get the message that unable to track ur location. But this not first time I ordered from nykaa on same location. N on the app I can't see my order details now.
Seamless experience
"Worst customer service experienced ever. They don't understand the customer's problem but keep on copy pasting the response. It is fraudulent. Paid orders will be at risk. They will take your money and when there is any problem with the delivery, they will keep citing illogical reasons, without solving any issues. If you don't want to be dumped out of your money, do not use nykaa"
Very glad with the experience in orders and good products
"Shopping in this app is very user friendly and rewarding. Thanks to the generous availability of the coupons and the reward points, we never have to think twice to buy what we love. The order are right on time and are so accurate to the point that I have never had to return or replace a single product throughout my two year usage of this app. Thank you Nykaa for being so authentic and exquisite. I am now trying your products and looking forward to having a good experience with them."
nice and best experience i have get..
Wonderfull experience
amazing experience...really quick delivery..good quality products.
Overall good experience

Good experience
Really loving my experience with nykaa.. you guys have such great offers. Saved almost 1300 rs on my orders today... gr8 deals n huge discounts. Thanks nykaa.. looking forward to more such discounts.üòò
worst experience
What happened to the user interface ! Earlier there was ingredients mentioned on every procedut but now I don't see that option. How would a customer buy without having the discription of the ingredients ? Please bring back the feature.
Very unhappy with your product quality and return policy. How can someone check cosmetics without opening it. I got a dry liner pen so i how do i return it.? I have obviously opened it then only came to know that i got a bad product. Isnt there any quality checking of products?? My first experience with you has been bitter. Edit your return policy and clearly mention it as non returnable like other sites do it for cosmetics.
excellent experience
nice nd mind blowing experience
great experience
Awesome Experience Here in Nykaa
always a lovely experience shopping at nykaa.
The customer care service is so bad. The delivery boy came to deliver a box which was already opened and one item was missing. I refused to accept the order. After that I raised a complaint. But it's been more than a week and Nykaa has done nothing. They so conveniently removed my previous chat. Looks like they are doing it intentionally to harass customers. Pathetic experience.
So my 2nd experience was really really awesome ... products delivered within 5 days ... awesome quality ...no damage ...price is good ...tnq nykaa
"Horrible experience ever. This is the worse app to shop. The customer service doesn't even know how to answer. All are freaking robots. You will have to talk to them in baby language for them to get anything. Does not provide the order on time. Fake offers . Babies for customer executive . I would give it 0 stars if there was such option. There is no response what so ever so for a brand claiming to provide world class products, they should first hire sensible people."
They've really made the whole experience seamless. Any issues? Their customer support is there. Returns are super easy. Although I doubt you'll have any issues in the first place
Very bad delivery experience. Guys don't go for it . Either buy products directly from stores or other Apps but definitely not from nykaa.
very good experience
Amuzng experience with Nykaa
Love the shopping experience
good experienceüëç
Very good Nayak my shopping experience is fab.
Nykaa is the best shopping app ever. Not only are the products great but their customer service is also outstanding. Everytime I shop with them I have an awesome experience.
**READ TILL THE END** I Had worst experience.. Worst packaging system ever! Once I have ordered several items and they sent all the items very nicely inside a big box BUT when I opened the box I saw that the hair serum I ordered was wasted... The cap of the bottle was fully opened (not broken) and the serum fell down making the whole box wet.. I couldn't get 1 single drop of the serum!!! They didn't exchange the bottle of serum & ignored my issue.. My money is wasted..
Good experience
"Best cosmetics eCommerce as it has a wide range of products ranging from budget to luxe ones. The user experience of the app is also very good and yes, just name the product and nykaa has it. But would also like to see Nykaa expanding and getting more brands into the platform like Lancome and Sisley hydra etc. Anyways I love the app very much. Six üåü s"
Amazing experience
Awesome products to see waiting to experience them
Very bad experience. It's for the second time in a row to that i have received damaged products.
WORST CUSTOMER CARE SERVICE!! TERRIBLE RESPONSE! ZERO RESPECT FOR CUSTOMERS TIME! Its been a good experience before but here is a situation! They have got me deliever Whole of a Wrong Box products. And there service is so miserable. I have been mailing them. calling them and still no response. Pathetic!
Great products available. Discounts are also good. When it comes to skin care & beauty products i prefer nykaa over any other app. Reliable & trustworthy. Till now good experience.
Everytime i order from nykaa i get what i expect I have pretty good experience with their service
Always a wonderful experience shopping with nykaa. . N offers are also amazing
Awesome experience
I have used nykaa several times but this time I had really bad experience I ordered some stuff and in the offer it was mentioned that I'll get free gift set but only the ordered product has been delivered to me without the gift set and the customer care people are also not entertaining my query...like whats the point of raving about hot pink sale if u cant even serve your customer properly...highly disappointed with nykaa
Good Interface and great stock
Worst Experience i got From nyka... I ordered 4 items and All the items are coming sperately and also the Delivery boy he was complete insane instead of knocking he was shouting.
"App is good, runs smoothly. Great experience. excellent service. fast delivery"
Always have had a good experience with nykaa
nice experience
Excellent experience. Products are super genuine and offers applied are alwz gud for pocket.
great and best experience
"Very bad experience with the return policy. i have ordered a product with 5 days return policy. i am not satisfied with the product and i want to return that product, as per the policy i have raised a request on same day and it's got Rejected. i have shared my concern on app chat section, but no action was taken."
great experience ordering super cool stuff at fingertips
its actually one stop shop for all sort of coametics amazing experience
Very good experience üôÇthank you nykaa
"Nykaa is something so irresponsible and disgusting. Once I didn't receive my order of 680rs but in nykaa they says my order is delivered. I did also call them, they said it's delivered. Most pathetic experience for me."
"It's my go-to place for makeup, skin, hair care products. It provides an authentic hassle-free online buying experience. Love Nykaa."
good experience nykka
"My experience till now is gud ,Thanx nyka teamüòä"
worst experience. waited for weeks and my shipment did not arrive. worst part is there is no customer care support or help. just forwarded emails and chats. this app has become a low level app. my money is gone and so is my faith in this brand.
Good experience.. genuine products
Good experience üòä
Had a great experience genuine product
Worst experience ever... And especially your delivery service sucks
"Worst experience with nykaa..I was using this app for 3 yrs but they have cheated..I had ordered some prepaid items..they made me wait for 3 months for the products and now showing product is delivered but I did not receive the product..when I complaint, their customer representative assure me to solve the issue within 72 hrs but they didn't show any interest to solve my issue..I never find my product.. don't do prepaid order with nykaa...Becareful with these types of frauds in online shopping"
"My experience with nykaa was good most of the times, still sometimes there are orders which take eternity to reach. Apart from that, the experience has been really satisfying."
Awesome experience üëç
"Don't order undergarments with this app...beacuse if ur product size wrong, 
u can't change...worst experience..üò°üò°üò°üò°"
Good experience
App is continuous crashing down every time showing error that we are facing internal network issue I reinstall it so many times but it's not working very bad experience
experience was quite good and the products were also very good.
Awsm experience
Having good experience always...
"I love nykaa for online shopping, quality is good, products are nice and can trust them. Good experienced while placing an order through nykaa. Love nykaa..."
"It's been 10 days since I returned my product back to nykaa and i still haven't got my refund. Worst customer service, worst shopping experience. All they say is, it takes 48 hrs for the refund to get initiated, tell me then why i have to wait for 10 days now and counting. Also to mention i received a wrong product from your end, my refund shoud be on priority. There is no SLA or whatsoever. Highly not recommended."
"Although the app sell genuine products, the prices of the products keeps changing like when products are on sale, prices of some products change so it doesn't make any difference. The experience with customer care is also not pleasant because issues are not solved quickly or smoothly."
good experience
Nice experience
Nice experience
always a good experience and genuine products
awesome experience
Very very bad. Worst experience ever. I have order a few products. They are the worst jn terms of customer service. I have received wrong products. Now in terms of return and refund they are just making me fool from past 2 months
i enjoyed the shopping experience
"Very bad experience,prepaid oder had not been delivered even in 16 days and customer executives haven't solved my problem.Really bad experience"
"The most worst app i have ever used... Delivery is worst... Even costumer care people are useless .... Never ever buy products from nykka.... Totally waste to order from this app.... Delivery agent himself cancel the order ..... Even the paid orders... And costumer care people are so useless, then say sorry and nothing else..... BAD EXPERIENCE FROM NYKA AND TEAMS.... and i started to buy products from other sites instead of nyka üëéüëéüëéüëéüëé"
"Used to be my favorite makeup shopping app! COD orders are such a hassle! 
The courier company does not coordinate and cancels the order without any 
prior notice to the customer. They do not attempt to redeliver it! Very bad 
experience! No response from Team Nykaa even though I reached out to them 
on all social media platforms and even sent them several emails and tried 
to connect through a in-app chat! Very bad social management! Truly 
disappointed!"
it's been more than 4 years now since I am using nykaa and not even a single time it has disappointed me .. Really love this app..All products are authentic and original.. Delivery is super fast .. overall a very good experience
Nice experience ‚ù§

Great experience shopping here. Love it.
Placed order by mistake to wrong address.. cancelled it..got my refund immediately..very happy..just one concern- when tries reordering the item it showed out of stock.had to order something else.but otherwise good experience.
"Good experience overall. With user friendly app, shopping becomes easy and smooth. If more discount and all can be arranged, it would be even better experience. I hardly get any discount for my Olay cream which I buy frequently üòë"
Good shoppibg experience on this app.....really happy
Good experience all good brands and products under one wonderful app
"I have ordered numerous times from Nykaa and other than a few times, it has been an awesome experience shopping with Nykaa."

amazing experience....
nice experience üòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑ
Very good experience in Nykaa m very happy with the products which I brought from Nykaa
This is the first and only bad experience with Nykaa. I love Nykaa for authentic products and on time delivery. But this time I'm really disappointed. I made tons of calls and sent several emails yet the team refused to exchange it for the right product even though they can clearly see from their records that they have placed wrong order from their end.
Having a great experience till date.
Amazing experience in shopping cosmetics
Had a great experience Thanks nykaa
Lovely experience
I am really loving all the products from Nykaa and I had best experienced with delivery.üôå
Return policy is not available in nykaa very bad experience
Its a beautiful experience with nykaa. I loved it
Very good experience. Totally love it
Amazing app!! Wonderful experience every time!
"I always have very good experience with Nykaa. You will find almost every product at its best price & authentic, delivery is also very quick. Now I never go to the store to shop cosmestics. Thanks & love Nykaa!!"
WORST experience.. Today i rcvd an empty bottle of maybelline hypermatte eyeliner..i felt like i m being thugged..though my earlier experience with nyaka ws gud..being a regular customer of nyaka i am totally dissapointed by them.
Always Awesome experience... beauty products with good pricing on hands.‚ò∫Ô∏è Happy Customer
Wonderful experience. Will recommend nykaa to every one
100% authentic products...... fabulous experience thanxx nykaa

had a good experience... must try
On time delivery. Original proudcts. Lots of sale. Pleasant experiences. üòä
Awesome experience
"Worst online experience, I had orderd on nykaa on 16 Oct and I haven't received my parcel yet . The courier company blue dart have to deliver my order but they even haven't called me , they don't provide service to my address then why they accept the order they have the option to deny and to clear to the nykaa that they don't provide service to that area but doing instead of that they are troubling customers. If you can't deliver my product then please return my money"
Had a great experience üòä
wonderful experience. genuine products... fast delivery... just no hassle buying
I have worst experience in prepaid order.. Har war wahi same reason dete hai üëéüëéüëé
Worst experience neither i got the product nor the refund
I totally trust nykaa. Love the brand's available and ratings/reviews help a lot to choose the right product. I frequently purchase from nykaa and I have never received a single damaged or wrong product. Delivery is amazing. Smooth experience.
Great experience
"My experience with Nykaa is horrible. When I installed the app, I wished to purchase regularly from this. But my first ever order made me regret chosing Nykaa over others. Their delivery partner is worst. The customer service is worst. No one will respond to you and no one will help you. You will feel like you lost the control over your choices. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. WORST SERVICE."
It was amazing experience
I always have a great experience with Nykaa. It's my go to app for everything related to beauty products.
Experience is good
Great experience
Lovely experience
"It's a nice app with wide variety of products. Delivery and product quality 
are awesome. However their customer service experience is not good. Once 
you select an option over call, nothing happens after that. I have called 
so many times but could not get through to their representative. Please 
test your customer service telecalling properly. It can only connect if we 
keep on pressing one option like 3 continuos ly"
"Fabulous, mind blowing experience, love you nykaa teamüë´üë´üë´ ‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫"
Having a terrible experience with Nykaa. No coupons or discount. What's the use of online shopping if I have to pay the same price as in buying from shop. Rather order from Myntra than Nykaa. Overall dissapointed!
Great experience. Very easy and sofisticated app.
"Amazing experience ,,just love all the products."
Its been already 10 days yet the shipment is not displaced from its vendor location. Bad experience. Customer service is also very poor. Wont go for it guys.
Very gud experience with nykaa
"good cosmetic product will get on this app at good discounted price, loved the experience."
Excellent experience üëç
Super experience with nykaa. Full of offers and discounts love you nykaaüòòüòòüòä
Nykaa gives a lot more than only make up products. Its an experience. It gives so much variety to choose from. The deals are amazing. The products are genuine. Nykaa has introduced so many K beauty range in India. Good job...
Worst shopping app ever...I placed an order during summer super saver sale and they confirmed my order and they itself returned the order to the warehouse without any prior notice... worst shopping experience üëé
Great place to shop makeup! Hassle free experience.
Good experience with Nykaa
Loving this app Multiple brands and offers Really nice experience .
Items were missing from my parcel. Despite of calling emailing and complaining many times there is no response from nykaa. Bad experience. Not expected from such a famous application like this.
Awesome experience ‚ô•Ô∏è
Awesome experience so far. Thank you Nykaa for quick delivery and reviewed products. Love u Nykaa...!
"Since my last review in July '17, nykaa's delivery time has improved. Their packaging is the best - enough shock proofing to safeguard products but not cumbersome to remove. The discounts & variety of brands are very good, only wish there were more benefits of being a prive member. The reward system is iffy - doesn't work when you review things. I have cancelled & returned products, money is credited timely in bank Ac or nykaa wallet. Overall I've always had a positive experience."
Excellent experience
Delivery boy was sooo rude üò°üò°üò° Hate this experience one star only because of that boy
Amazing experience! Products are little Expensive but worth the priceüëç
good experience
"products are genuine. have many more options to choose.. delivery is slightly delay, so giving 4 stars. otherwise nice experience to shop beauty products online on Nykaa.."
overall experience till date is good
i hv great experience through.... as i purchased since last 2-3 years.....vast variety of cosmetic available.... love nykaaüòç
happy with the whole experience with nykaa
Worst app... they don't deliver you on time...very bad experience
Hassle free and clear interface...
Awsome experience
very good app.. but I don't get notifications of out of stock products when they're available nice shopping experience delivery is very fast
I am using this app for the first time. Enjoyed it. Great experience.. For a novice it's a very good app. Thanks love it.
good experience
It's basically about the courier service . I ordered some products from here but the courier service responsible for this delivery never delivered to me. They never contacted me in regards with same order and they even returned my order without my consent and there is no way to contact the courier partner as well. It was really disappointing experience this time.
After reading bad comments and other things that it is a fraud app and poor quality of products and expire products... I really very upset . I want to order so many products ... But now I will not place order ... Thank you guys for giving your experience ... Its very shameful for this app
"Great App, had a good experience!"
good experience
Great app.. Best shopping experience.. Happy to say that all the products received are originals and are pocket friendly.. Best offers.. Love you lot team Nykaaüòçüòòüòòüòò

very good experience for this app.

Awesome experience
"Worst experience with nykaa Very very poor service. I continuously ( daily basis) called nykaa from last 10 days. But these guys not taken seriously my issue. I returned some product from my end and courier partner too delivered that product to nykaa. But they are refusing. They didn't approve my refund till now. I am fed up in calling nykaa as daily I have to explain my problem to new executive. They said wait for 24-48 hours. But nobody is n taking action. In all these, my amount get stucked. Very very poor refund facility. Never gonna order from this site."
"Loving this app for shopping for makeup products. Till now, it works well and also provides some samples once in a while. Would recommend for a good shopping experience."
Good experience
Best beauty app ever experienced...It has never let me down with the products i ordered... Always awesome üòç... Thanks alot for all this ‚ù§‚ù§ Will continue to do shopping in future tooüòäüòá
"Excellent experience with nykaa till now. On time delivery, original products, great packaging."
"My shopping experience was good with Nyka.There are a lot of options available to select products.I have ordered from Nyka for the first time, now it is to see how long they deliver."
Grt experience and full trust
Overall it's a very good experience. Wide range of products with genuine price.
One of the worst website.Delivery of product is very worst.very bad experience with product order from Nykaa
Excellent experience! Never fails to deliver the best customer experience!
very bad experience. firstly chat now option is not working and then I have ordered a product and till now. it is not delivered and I ordered same item from two days after and that has been delivered.i will never order from this app. and I will stop ‚úã everyone to buy from this app. ab tk mera order deliver nhi kiya
Awesome app! great shopping experience!
"Very dissapointed. Ordered for the first time and had bad experience. After successful transfer of money through net banking order was not placed and ""help center"" option is not helping. Not a good app..."
Good experience.....very good app...value for money...all tha same gets real in it....ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
"Till now shopping experience was nice.satisfaction of getting genuine and authentic products ,not fake one."
"Worst experience ever from an online site. it's been more than 20 days since I ordered few products, I didn't receive it yet didn't get any notification from nykaa about the products as well. i called their customer care and told them my concern, they promised to solve it in one day but no response till the date. indeed the worst service ever by any online shopping site."
Had a really great experience with variety of products nd delivers the product on tymüíü
good experience üëç
i have a worst experience with nykaa.. i want to gave it 0 star.. i did purchasing from nykaa 3 times.. and all the three times ordered cosmetic's packaging seals are broken.. seems like the orignal one changed from the duplicate ones.. the delivered products quality are very worst..looks like local one.. nykaa plz don't brake the customer's trust.. there is no return policy for cosmetic's..
best experience with best product and best deals
I haven't ordered anything from nykaa yet but this review is based upon my friend's orders. Actually I was the one who told them to buy from this site in the first place! They both ordered a pack of products and when they received they found atleast one of the products was fake / broken/ used ! I immediately told'em to write a bad review after they told me about the false products ! Worst experiences with nykaa so far ! Didn't expect a huge brand to cheat on costumers like this! Bogus!That's it!
Great experience üëçüòÄ
Had a good experience
The experience was good.
It has all the convenient and reasonable price products .good experience.
great experience
Very cheap experience with nykaa on this pink sale
Order not showing in the app Worst experience in my life Please solve this problem üôè
My experience is always the best with u this app..its user friendly and the products are gd and original...Thanks for making shopping easy.
Worst experience...customer care service is very bad..they will say ur refund is initiated but they never initiate it and when u ask again they will we have initiated. But everytime they tell teh same and still not received my refund.. Also they don't reply to your queries
"i had a great experience with nykaa,,,, they are selling all authenticate products,,,,, and em in love with their packaging, how they pack ur stuff n oll..... keep it up üòä"
I have been giving the notify me option for quite a long time . plsss can you work on the restocking. Thanks much for the response. Team I was not able to add a review so editing my previous one. Plssss stock HUDA beauty toffee shade . Plssssssssssss. It goes out of stock everytime. It will be great if we get the instock notifications in our mobile number. But everytime it is just an amazing experience with Nykaa. Keep it going. You guys do a fabulous job.
lovely experience
I just love nykaa . Best experience ever
Worst app worst experience does fraud will say discount but after applying coupon and meeting all the criteria they say that coupon code was not applied even after applying code worst app worst store don't buy anything don't meet minimum order criteria they are just fraud even customer support is not able to solve the issue worst first and last experience will recommend not to purchase anything from nykaa all of people I know or I don't .
Xcellent experience
It's a good app but this time i didn't get my order.worst experience for this time
Our very bad experience with nykaa products.they always deliver us damage and wrong shades of every material that ordered by us.they are showing only offer with other brand but tottly wrong and bad material sended by these brands.
Have been a long time customer for Nykaa and my experience has been good except for that one time where they didn't initiate return/refund for dried out lipsticks
Loved the experience on nykaa!! The everyday deals are amazing and the products are also genuine üíì
very easy to find the required product...easy to compare with other brands.... review are also helpful in buying......inshort Great shopping experience
love love n love it... it was a nice experience of shopping....üòò
Very great experience üòä

It's is a great experience in shopping nykaa for the first time ‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫
Best experience as always...........
Overall its a good experience
great experience to shop with you üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ
They send me the discount coupon applicable only on first order...AFTER the first order had already been placed...their customer service is absolutely useless...i really dont know why i ordered from them instead of amazon...never doing that again...thanks for a crappy first experience.
Lovely experience with nykaa..the best online beauty retailer of india ..i reccomend this app to every beauty junkie out there
Good experience
Waiting for the products excited for the first experience on nykka
"Extremely bad experience. The last purchase made me promise never to buy from Nykaa anymore. I had to follow up for more than a month for a refund. The quantity delivered was incorrect.photographs of the incomplete order and images of the invoice also didn't convince the Nykaa team that the customer was speaking the truth. Extremely disappointed with Nykaa. Have moved on to other apps which provide similar services. For me,it's RIP Nykaa!"
My experience with Nykaa is excellent. Nykaa has been a one stop destination for products that was difficult to find in my city (Guwahati) and the discount on the products make it even better. And delivery is always on time. My overall experiences with Nykaa is Good.
wonderful online shoping experience. . i really loved it
good experience with nykaa
superb experience shoping wid Naykaa
really i have great experience with naykaa i love it ‚ù§
loved the experience of shopping make up online. all thanks to nykaa
Very good experience üòç Loved it‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
i will check the order delivery and tell my experience.
Nice experience using this app
I've got the worst experience..nykaa has the worst return policy..I'm cancelling the order again n again and they are sending me messages again out for delivery..I've requested a return..no response on that too...never gonna shop again from this app
Very poor customer support.. I'm waiting for their reply in the chat session like i dont have any other work in my life..and then they will end the chat if you don't reply then back in some seconds.. Pathetic experience with you nykaa..
Shopping with Nykaa is a very beautiful feeling for me. I can select all genuinely branded products in one roof.. So far all great experience n wish it continues to be same..
Its a worst experience with Nyka. Order a product and got a damaged one..I chhose refund in Nyka wallet as describe by nyka that it is one tap payment. Easy to use. But what Nyka has done ...it has limited nyka wallet for some products. I want to know from Nyka ..is this your money that you restrict me to pay? Pathetic. Don't want to use it more now. They make customer fool.
Good experience wid nayka üòä
Worst app. Recently i found about the experiences of the employees and how they were treated at Nyka. Please boycott this app..
My experience is very disappointing. Its my birthday month and even after being a prive member i have not received my birthday gift with today's order. I am trying to connect with your support team but couldn't connect. Also I have checked that my DOB is correctly updated.
love it..... Enjoy it üíûüíûüíûüíüüíüüíùüíùüíùüíüüíüüéâüéâüéâüéâüéáüéäüéäüíïüíïüíïüíïüíïüéãü§óüíñüíñüíóüíóüíóvery nice experience..... quality of goods are great... Happy to use it....... just love the makeup
lovely experience
Amazing! experience
hassle free shopping experience
Awesome experience
Awesome experience
Nykaa has always given me great shopping experience! Quality products and prompt delivery!
"I just love the way Nyka makes it easy for me and for other women out there, to reach out to their favourite products which is otherwise not widely available in your nearest retailer. With the wide range of products and multiple reviews for the same, it only makes the first time purchase experience for products more confident than you could get buying it off the shelf at a physical beauty store. Brilliant app."
For the very first time it was a good experience..
has raised the beauty standards in India by getting in the best brands across the world and providing women a novel experience of beauty and makeup
"The worst service I have experienced so far. I was told the items I have ordered will be delivered by 6th December. But till today, there is no sign of it. Order was placed on 2nd December and they shipped it on 6th December after initiation from me. Then they shifted the delivery date on 9th December. But today also I haven't received my package. Great service though, nykaa. I will not recommend anyone to use this app."
"Nykaa I find one of the best places to find all the products you are looking and experience is phenomenal. I can read product details, filter as per my requirements and get good discounts. This is not a fake review. I am genuinely happy with them"
amazing experience..
great experience
"Worst experience i have ever faced. They are not paying proper attention to customers time & money. Quality of delivery is extreamly poor or even lower if there is any rating scale is there. Kindly not to buy any product from Nykaa. Further tracking of consignment is also not reliable. They are providing a contact number for tracking our product, but that was not functioning and the courier partner was cancelling thw the delivery without even calling the customer and saying that delivery failure."
I've ordered twice from this app to the same location. But for the third time they didn't send me my order. I tried talking to the customer service for a whole week they only said that the order will arrive within 48 hr but it never did. Worst experience ever. M not ordering from this app ever again! üëçüèª
Excellent experience
"Nice experience ,fast delivery , original products"
ü§© gr8 experience
"Pathetic Customer service, no proper response on call or even their chats. Chatbot experience is as good as useless, made to wait too long and they just close your complaint without any thought. Tele callers also not at all helpful"
Loved nykaa app and products are owesome. First experience and fantastic experience üòçüëç
always wow experience...Nykaa always makes sure that they reach customer satisfaction with their high product quality and services. moreover they keep on coming up with so many campaigns and excited deal..a must have application üåº

superb experience i love nykaaaaaaaaa
Awesome app.. i just love shopping for all my cosmetics here in Nykaa. The experience is great.
Good experience with this device
great experience everytime I shop... good discounts and fast delivery
I don't give review on any app this is the first time I'm giving my review on any app. I just loved your delivery. When I used to order my product the second day I used to received it. The delivery was very quick. Over all my experience with nykaa was so good. But 1 thing disappointed me is my last order was of rs 2200 which came very quick no offense in this but for my next order the points weren't added from the purchase of my previous order. I hope nykaa you'll read my review and help me in this. Love from your regular customer.
Most authentic makeup selling site...loving the experience ‚ô•Ô∏è
The app is amazing üëç best deals and timely delivery üòäLiked the shopping experience at nykaa
"I always shop with nykaa. From daily essential to makeup everything under one roof. 1st delivery. Variety of products, lots of brands. Wonderful experience"
Good experience üëç
"Cancelled order which was not getting shipped since week, they refused to give full refund. Worst experience ever"
"There is absolutely nothing you can't find on Nykaa. It's an enriching experience to discover things that you always wanted, right there, a click away. The delivery of the products is faster than any other app.. I love Nykaa."
Great experience
always find great offers .... amazing experience always üôÇ
Bad experience   Orderd something. Else got something. Else
excellent experience with nykaa
I am glad to be with Nykaa! Shopping with Nykaa is indeed a good experience and with saving without affecting budget.
"Good, clean and useful interface."
Good experience
"i removed two stars because although ive had very good experiences with nykaa i recently purchased 2 hair irons, from the same brand for my mom and me.. both came with different packaging, one was clearly fake. nykaa refused to refund, take it back or exchange it. they asked me to contact the manufacturer directly, who did not pick up any calls. I'm feeling cheated on this experience as Nykaa refused to take any responsibility saying that they take zero responsibility for electrical goods....ü§ê"
Great shopping experience..Very good app to purchase your needs go for it
awsm experience
Great experience... love Nykaa
It's nice experience with Nykaa
Such a great experience shopping with nyka... Discounted products... Nyka never disappoint... Good quality products. Worth buying..

"awesome experience overall assured quality, fab delivery processüëå"
Hi Nykaa... I had very worst experience while ordering and after ordering. Please try to keep the words you promise to your customers.
I have pretty good experience using this app so far. Authenticity is what I appreciate the most when it comes to nykaa.
"Awesome experiences, original products with timely delivery. I m loving it üòç"
Wonderfull experience..I just loved the products
I have a terrible experience about the delivery system you have.üò≠üò≠üò≠
Experience that changed my life.
gud experience
"Good shopping experience, delivery times are also quick"
Worst experience....the order is placed but is returned back without the customers knowledge...the delivery person did not even call or attemp to deliver the product at the respective address...instead update it as the customer has refused to accept the order...other shopping apps are far better than nykaa for online shopping
First experience is quite good...
Good experience
Amazing experience with naykaa till now:))
It has always been an amazing experience shopping on this app.. the variety of products and the discounts are great..
Well i am having a very bad experience this time ..i got my delivery perifectly last time with the same address and ph no. But this time they say that there might be something wrong with my address or ph.no . what nykaa has gone crazy now ..or cant provide good workers

Delightful first experience in shopping. Yet to review on orders.
It is always a wonderful experience shopping on nyka
As they gave us 100% original products m happy with your service really good experience using nykaa
Nice experience
Great experience !
Worst shipping experience ever 1st package came really late 2nd the courier man didn't come at the address and had to call him many a times then too the package wasn't delivered to address i had to go to the place he told near my area to collect it... it is very disappointing. The guy was from shadowfax and didn't even care to search for the address
"i ordered my product , i m waiting for my experience."
So far experience has been good hope it will continue to be the same in future also
This app doesn't have any responsibility weather the courier service agents deliver us the products or not. especially when it is prepaid. I have had a very bad experience with this app and have uninstalled it.
Super experience...nd very fast delivery
Awesome experience
Nyc experience .... One of the best shopping app
Superb experience with nykaa
Good range of products Always nice experience on shopping
"Worst customer service, no proper delivery service, when you chat they don't even care to respond worst experience I had with these people"
Great Experience
Worst shopping app ever.. didn't receive my order yet even after making payment it's been more than 10 days.. just receiving msgs ever days from nykaa team unable to deliver your order on time.. Ridiculous worst experience ever.. won't be ordering again and also ask my colleagues to do the same..
"very nice experience till now in 4 years . always satisfied . yeah nyka should focus a lil more on packaging, bcz smtyms damaged products have been received by me. ex.,caps of shampoos broken like that. otherwise its good about authencity about produt and at discounted rates in comfort of our home üòä"
It's my 1st order... I ordered 6 products nd payed using Gpay... 2 products were removed from my cart without mentioning the reason... Tried to ask reason frm them bt couldn't reach...Was quite sad with 1st experience ...
Very pathetic customer service guys. They show you there terms and conditions at the end and just give you one word sorry. Be genuine atleast you guys are not returning the product then give instructions at start if it is gift for someone then please don't buy because anyways the person doesn't like it you are not going to return. You guys have set an really good example of customer service Thanks for the experience.
Firstly it shows me discount of 300 on first purchase then when i made the order there is no discount and full amount is deducted from my account.. Worst experience with you and when i complained they told me that mam that offer is expired so we can't do anything..are you guyz making us fool? If it is expired why you are showing to us on cart on total amount then while making payment deducting full amount...you guyz are just making money
Gud experience
amazing experience till nowüòç love nykaaa.. best site for self care quality products with discounts üòç
"Love doing shopping on this app. Great products, lot of options and quick delivery. everything add on to a great experience."
Shopping experience is good
"Great app for buying beauty products. Nice interface, hassle-free and timely delivery and a great range of products. Reliable app."
It was good experience for the first time.
shopping On Nykaa is always a great experience....thank u team Nykaa üòÄ
Such a great experience... love to have it. Thanx nykaa
Great experience
"I have been using the app for a while. I have very good experience untill now. All of sudden it is giving me ""we are facing some internal issue"" when i click on little bag icon in top right corner. I uninstall & reinstall the app but still no luck."
awesome experience I love you Nykaaüòä
Wonderful experience
The overall experience of the application is good. The delivery used to be very prompt earlier but is taking more time these days probably because of the second wave of covid.
Worst experience ...I've ordered product and one of my product was damage ...I complained to replace n then it's got logout automatically...I've mailed a complain but there is no response...they r saying raise a concern from your app..but I m unable to login my old account it's creating my new account...how can I raise a concern...now they are not replacing my product...wastage of money or time....will nvr purchase from this app...or will not suggest anyone to use this app to purchase cosmetics
"Having the worst experience with nykaa, didn't have this kind of experience even with Amazon. Nowhere during the purchase they mentioned that returns are not being accepted currently due to hygiene reasons and now I have ‚Çπ1200 skirt that is not even my size and will go to waste. This nothing but looting. They have lost one regular customer for sure now. Not fair at all. I contacted their support team and they were indifferent. For common people ‚Çπ1200 is more than this company thinks."
great experience
"Worst app, worst services, No one responses on customer care, No tracking information you get, no fixed delivery dates, worst service partner(wow express). It was a bad experience with nykaa."
awesome experience
Experience was good...nice collection with variety of products...i personally like the variety provided in sizes... overall good experience
enjoying the shopping experience with Nykaaüòç
"Product purchasing and delivery experience is very good ,all time product are properly packed Nykaa is one of the best."
"Hated it.Customer support is so poor.I made an order and received wrong products.I had raised tickets to exchange/return these items a few times but no action has been taken yet.customer care executives are always busy since half a month,issue is not solved yet.Very bad experience."
overall it was a good experience üëç packing and the products are really good keep it up nykkaüíö
Have good experience with this app . Product are of good quality and packing is awesome.
Good experience
The bestest makeup app i have ever experienced... Thank you nyka‚ù§
will never shop here again. horrible service from customer care. the app asks for payment before checking for delivery address. and then once payment is done they do not allow address change. they alliw customers to fall into this trap and take no responsibility for the bad experience.
great experience good service
everytime the experience is awesume
"The Nykaa app has a very user-friendly interface and I like that there is a degree of personalization that you can add per your skin and hair care needs. Ordering is hassle-free, packaging is good but could be more eco-friendly. Overall, the online purchase experience with Nykaa is near-perfect."
very good experience. thank you nykaa
I had fine experience with the app and its offers..but I faced problems regarding my orders..the product I purchased currently was in offer in which I'll get 2 pieces of the item but received only one.i logged the complaint but the support team has not replaced it nor given me refund. The solution I was given with was not satisfactory. Misleading offers and support. Very Disappointed
Loved the nyka experience
amazing experience
"Best experience! However, one of my favourite brand Bath and body works products are few.Please get there products onboard ü§©."
Best experience of my life with Nykaa...‚ù§‚ù§

"A perfectly splendid experience.. one stop for all my needs. Not only one can find all the products easily but also at a discounted rates, thanks to the offers that keep coming up every other day.."
It has been great experience with nykaa since 3years but I want to tell nykaa as a responsible citizen nykaa needs to take back the empties so that they can recycle and send back those to each brand for recycling. Though it's nice to see they have changed the packaging from bubblewrap to brown paper..
Overall it was a great experience
I love the shopping experience

Awesome experience with nyka
"My experience was really bad with them, i have placed an order on normal days and it reached to my address in just 3 days. So i have again placed an order on sale day on 23 july, 2020 at mid night. They have dispatched my order in 2 boxes, one reached me in 2 days and the other is still in transit. Everyday I'm calling them to deliver my order and all they r doing is ""we understand ur concern. We have shared it with our delivery agent"". This is all i get! Poor & Pathetic service."
"Extremely pathetic delivery service. I have not received my order inspite of the fact that it is already in my city. No attempts are being made to deliver my order. No help from nykaa and well, my order is prepaid as well. I am usually very impressed by nykaa but this is the most pathetic experience with nykaa. I hope I either get my order or at least get the refund!!"
amazing experience
Great interface. It is such a joy to go on a retail therapy here.
Wonderful experience Every product and and any range they have with good quality and secure package üëåüëç
Nice Experience

"i ordered from nykaa worth Rs 1700, one item worth Rs 500 was missing from the order, i filed a complaint that day for refund they said it will take 24 to 48 hours, but approx a month has passed already but no refund has been granted. Worst experience, i think i lost my money, please beware"
It was nice experience to buy products with naykaa. It's fully trustable. All product materials are same as shown.
Very bad experience. Tried ordering things but they just couldnt initiate the order. Very much disappointed .
Wonderful experience

It's been lyk 13 days but still the products are not delivered ...very bad experience..worst app...Will never buy anything from it #hated it

"Horrible experience...am using nykaa from so many years.this has never happened. My order is still not delivered but got a msg stating it's delivered. Nykaa has this OTP options, I don't know how can a agent deliver the product without taking the OTP and the agent didn't even call me.It was a prepaid order. Pathetic service.what do I do now?????????"
good experience
"So far I had a good shopping experience in nykaa... products are really 
good and plus delivery timing and packaging is also good......I hope Nykaa 
maintains its position... And yes last but not the least...they always have 
a very good offers...and free gifts...thank you Nykaa...good going..."
Not getting the refund even after waiting from more than a month. Worst experience for the refund process.
Very bad experience. They never delivered your purchase on time.. I always suffer....
"My experience was worst with this app. They provide worst customer care services they keep calls on hold and than get vanished . They kept my callon hold for 20 minutes.( Mai to nala baitha hu in logo ke liye jaise ye log as a celebrity feel kar rahe hai. Humko to kaam he nahi hai jaise bus inko call karte raho aur ye aap ka bhoot , bhavishya aur vartaman se aap ke antariksh product ke khooj karte rahenge.) In short they got bloody creep services."
Good experience
"It's an amazing experience to shop on nykaaa......love u laottttt,"

Excellent experience with nyka app
Worst app ever! I was a prive customer but not now! They don't deliver all the products properly and argue that they've done without proper investigation! I'm at a complete loss and then don't even give a damn about it! I've made many purchases on this app but not anymore! They don't know how to treat their customers! I feel disgusted to have made so many purchases on this app! It's just so worthless! Bad experience ever!!!
Incredible experience every time I order something.
awesome experience.... love dis app
Very bad experience. I have bought a eyeshadow pallet.when i opened it there was fungus. I have done chatting section in the app. The response was too slow. What the hell!!!!! Now how can i return the product. I cannot accept this.

worst experience. ordered 3 products received only one and in the app showing as a delivered. called thrice to the customer care but no use. raised tickets also.now not even refunding my money back also not getting the products. DO NOT ORDER IF YOU ARE PAYING BEFORE.
pathetic services pathetic customer care pathetic nyka pathetic courier service fake people and they are not attempting the delivery we are getting the messages only that it will be delivered today and they are not going to attempt they was just saying that consignee not available and they give some bloody reasons not to deliver those products so I had a very bad experience with Nayka and their Customer services. they bothered about it when it's a cash on delivery and not on prepaid delivery..üëé
"Please i would say, to think 100 times before ordering from this site., as my friend ordered some products and due to Corona virus problem she left the parcel untouched for 3 to 4 days later when opened she found the products moist so had asked for a reason but no reply later she used it.. n there were black marks on her face. After resending mails they give a stupid reason saying its not coz of their products and the limit of refund is over n this n that. Very shameful experience"
Very good experience ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
Good experience
i am a makeup junky and nykaa i think is a mist stop every week. They also have irresistible offers on mass brands which is a plus but i would love if they launch reductions in brands like Huda beauty too .. but cheers for the selection and great interface
Best online shopping experience and great prices üíü
AWESOME EXPERIENCE üòäüëçfastest n carefully delivered the products ...
Good experience
"Its my first time purchase from nykaa, I'm looking for a good experience."
There is no actual updates on the order. Order gets really delayed and no one in the support section has any info. Worst experience ever..!!
Had a worst experience with Nyka.. It's totally money wasting app.. Girls don't get fooled by it... All cosmetics sold are fake..
Great experience
Nice experience till now
I have very good experience with Nykaa so far. Usually they deliver my products within 3 days but from my last 2 purchases they took more than one week to deliver. i hope this time i get my order on time.
My experience are toooo good for nykaa nd product are much better
"My order is missing. I have ordered an eye liner of blue heaven, but they deliver me only its wrapper. No product is there. very disappointed your app is very poor with return and refund services of orders. bad experience... feeling like my money is waste at nykaa"
"Wide range of products, smooth interface, easy to shop by product reviews. Delivery isn't always on time, but the quality of products delivered is perfect."
I really had a very bad experience with Nykaa as I ordererd some products on 25 Dec and didn't receive the same till 10 Jan and started following up with Nykaa regarding the same as it was a prepaid order but I did not get any concrete response. They kept telling me that they r working on my issue but nothing happened. I finally told them to cancel my order and refund the amount but I got the same old response and today is 28 Jan and I still haven't got my refund and I m still getting the same
Nice experience üëå
"A very happy n appreciable app...The best guide to a woman's need...

Good experience
Awesome app... selling authentic product on affordable price.We can get good products deals on nykaa. I am really very happy with my shopping experience on nykaa! Would recommend to everyone
"worst experience when i ordered things on discounts- they only delivered 4 5 products. most of the products which are on discounts dont deliver.even i call delivary office they told me that they have return my products. i asked then who raise the return policy. thry didnt have a proper answer bh saying contact nykaa. when i contact nykaa they told me u have to re order the things . and now product are cost me double the amount now . i didnt get a any call, attempt . not even i return products."
Good experience
Too worst customer service. I placed an orde4 and by mistake not update my old number which was close.and from last one week i am asking them to update my number but dont know how the system works they are not able to update my no. Too bad experience
Awesome experience on nykaa.. providing wonderful offers... On time delivery.. large number of brands.... Steal the deal offers... Quality products... Quality assurance........ Love NYKAA
In love with Nykaa . Nice experience shopping from nykaa.easy n variety of branded n quality products to choose. Price are reasonable but u can provide more good offers
"Horrible experience. Signed up for the first time ordered a pair of shoes. 11 days went by and the order was not shipped. Talked to support 4 times and each time they promised it will be shipped shortly. On the 12th day they cancelled the order on their own. It was a gift for someone and now i am empty handed. Guess what, You get a 10% discount on sign-up and now i cant even use that because they cancelled the order. Pathetic service and pathetic support"
it has been a great experience.
Ibcan not sign up for it. When i used my frn's account to log in it is taking too much time to load. Whenever i open lakme products the app automatically stops. Worst experience
Good experience üòäüòä
My experience with Nykaa is awesome....keep growing
This is one of the best app out there! My experience has been good always and I'm absolutely in love with the app. Amazing range of products to choose from. Nykaa is doing a a great job!‚ù§Ô∏è
Enjoyed Experience of Customer Satisfactory shopping‚ò∫
Nice experience
My favourite beauty and personal care retailer. I've had the best experience with Nykaa so far. The products are 100% genuine. The delivery is done on time. I ordered the wrong shade once and they were nice enough to take the product back and offer a refund. Keep up the amazing work Nykaa.
Superb experience shopping on Nykaa.
Good experience
amazing shopping experience online
trust full experience
Overall Good Experience
Really good experience.....loved itüòçüòçüòçüòç
I Have Been Shopping With Nykaa for So Long. Neva had a Bad Experience. This Time I Orders a Maybelline Fit Me Foundation & Received a Duplicate/Damaged Product. When Called At The Costumer Care They Just Refused To Even Consider The Problem. Because They Have Just 5 Days Return Policy. I Would Suggest To Please Check Your Products As Soon As You Receive. Especially During The Sale.
"Wide Range of products,fast delivery and very good packing as well. Over 
all it has been a good experience with nykaaüòäüòä."
I didn't have experience üò≥
amazing experience
Great experience! Really need Morphe and Jeffree Star products aswel ;)
Lovely experience
My name is kazol ..my experience is very good with Nykaa become their delivery is very easy and quick as the quality üëç
good experience and reviews help a lot to choose the product.
amazing experience
good experience shopping in nykaaaa
"I have been with nykaa for long 5+ years and alway had nice experience until this time. App itself is amazing but offers bad customer service. I have some items missing from my shipment which i reported immediately. Your agents comes back and say we sent all items and closes off ticket. First you didn't resolve issue. Second, you almost called me a liar and third you don't even have courtesy to call. I can bear a loss of 300-400 bucks but this is really bad experience and creates trust issues."
Really great service.. Never had any bad experience from nykaa. Had faced atleast one issue from all other shopping sites.. So now this is the place where i search for everything first.
"A very good app if you want to purchase things related to makeup,skincare and other stuff. The payment experience is really smooth. No issues while using the app. They deliver before the actual delivery date mentioned. Kudos to u for delivering even during this pandemic.They give you good offers and discounts on products.Keep going Nykaa. Will keep purchasing.üòä"
Amazing and seamless experience
Amazing shopping experience!!!! Loved it.
Wonderful experience
"I order a product as we'll as paid too but it's in app showing that it 
delivered still I'm not receiving any products.i mention the address of 
west bangal but the product received by a Tamil nadu guy ...how this kind 
of think possible.bad experience"
Great experience
My experience with nykaa is good
"Wow Nyka i'm really  overwhelmed with your response,after so many incessant  requests you still  could not get my oder delivered, thank you for giving me so much trouble, it was so awesome to call your team everyday and make requests of my order to get delivered, thank you so much for this experience,I would never like to order anything  for Nyka again and will feel so very privileged to uninstall this app asap."
My experience is good...I am really happy to buy products with discounts
"Lots of love to Nykaa. I have purchased my products from this lovely aap but I had 2 bad experiences - Crayon lipsticks came broken twice when I ordered from Nykaa. Pls take this as honest feedback and please make sure that the products deliver in good order. But, I still love to order from Nykaa."
Experience with nyka is awesome so far Thanks
"Love the experience of the app, it has most updated prices ."
Amazing shopping experience for beauty products! Worth your time.
Really good experience
"Not very happy with using the Nykaa wallet. The company claims that the refunds are processed within 24 hours of cancellation, its been over 3 days and I still see 0 balance in wallet. When I contacted the executives, I get a different response everytime. Someone says it takes 2 days, some say 4-6 while some say 5-7 days. I have been a loyal customer of Nykaa since years, but these small things do spoil the whole experience of shopping. Probably the 1st and last time of using the wallet."
I have worst experience with u nykaa... you delivered me duplicate product.. you cheat your customer.
"I ordered some 10 items, paid for all items. 2 products were Missing and the customer service is least bothered to respond. The help service doesn't resolve the grievances. Worste app and shopping experience. Customer care replied in facebook for name sake and vanished. Absolute frauds."
great experience.. its a great app .. i open it almosy every day!! very easy to use... nd it provide all the brands..all the products are original nd amazing üòÅüëç
"Fake proudcts. Worst shopping site and worst customer service experience. I ordered 2 lipstick and 1 is free with them but they send me same color as free one which I ordered. So, I got 2 lipstick with same color but there is huge color difference in both. So, basically they send me fake product and they are not ready for return. Will never recommend this to anyone."
worst experience with this app I don't even received any Call or message for delivery of product but received a message telling that my order was cancelled by myself... I didn't even know that's the trouble happened exactly
Nice experience. Product is good delivery on time...
I had a very good shopping experience with Nykaa. It has great brands with very good products. First I think that it only has cosmetics products but no it also has grooming appliances. I love Nykaa and thank you Nykaa for this.
Always had a good experience!!!
"I used this app for the first time and I had a very good experience, also for the first time I used a nykaa product(lipstick). Unbelievably, it is upto the mark.. I wud request the company to keep up the services and the quality of the products.. üëåüëåüëçü§©"
"Pathetic experience, first time I tried ordering in Nykaa thinking I would get my product on time but since 10 days I have been waiting for it but no delivery. I have made multiple attempts to contact the help center but of no use they only say we will look into the matter and there is no action at all. This app has terrible support service. None of them respond to your queries or resolve them."
my shopping experience was very good every product received in gud condition ü§óüòò
So far nice experience through putting first order ever... Eager to receive the order
good experience so far
I am having a very experience with nykaa
awesome experience with naykaa.. additionally they come with the great discounts which we cant find on the normal shops... I just love naykaa
"Like this app very much than the official website which is saggy. This app, my place to access most of my Grooming. But wish they include some more good brands like klairs and some tools like vanity planet which is not available. I get how some of the companies dealership work. It's just that, would be better if they expand the shopping experience to some good brands, nykaa would be really huge. Particularly the date of each products is much much necessary. Anyway good experience with this app."
shopping with nykaa is always a great experience.
Team Nykaa please provide COD option for order above 500rs... otherwise I really liked overall experience and also loved pricings of products...hope I get quality products.üíØ
Very good experience
AWESOME experience
So far I'm having good experience with nykaa. Looking forward for the same.. ‚ô°
If could I wouldn't even give this app one star. This app just eats money. You transfer the money from your bank account to the app's so called wallet and it vanishes in the middle. It will got deducted from your account but it won't come in the wallet. I had such a bad experience over this stupid app. And the support members doesn't even bother to solve the issue when asked for the help. The rude service they are running on. Its been 6 days and still no progress on the problem. worst app ever.
great experience
worst experience about delevery boy..üò°
Trying to experience more
"A great place for all your beauty, wellness and health related needs. Amazing shopping experience."
Awesome experience with this app.Xoxo
Very bad experience.....easy return on nykaa is complete lie . They never responded to my return request.
Amazing experience...
"Nykaa was good initially but now delivery becomes pathetic, warehouse used to keep products with them instead of timely delivery. Customer service is also waste of time as they never work on provided solutions . No response on Emails, call or other concerns. No call from delivery partners and if you want to check they did not pick the call. Overall you will not get your things for at least good 15 days. Frustrating experience... I hope you guys are only working for you tubers."
"I had a very bitter experience with this app. Firstly I get all of the 6 products wrong which was worth 1699. Then after lot of calling and mailing it took about two weeks to initiate a return. Then the delivery boy didn't pick up my parcel because proper reason wasn't given to them. Again, after the 2nd attempt of pick up the app hasn't updated anything. I had to call and inquire again about the status. So now its almost a month and didn't receive my refund. Thanks for nothing Nykaa."
"Pathetic Experience with nykaa . They are making a fool out of people. Although there so many good products but mostly they are all Chinese manufactured product when they say they sell ""Authentic"" products and they have the worst customer services ever, they won't listen to your problems regarding the product you bought with your hard earned money, they will reject your return/replacement request without any explanation what so ever after making you wait for weeks."
Very bad experience. In future i will never buy anything
Amazing experience with fastest delivery
original product with offer's and delivery on time.overall superb experience.
Amazing experience
"fraud company ever ! don't buy anything from Nykaa , I have 1 year personal experience , where i have experienced order cancellation many times without delivery & my reward points which were used to order were removed from my account , As you won't trust as many as more than 10000 /- worth points from me & my family accounts were removed through order cancellation ! Do i have lost money by joining this Fraudster Company & placing orders , so stay away from it , Instead order from Trusted company!"
I dont know why state entry tax is being imposed on every product in the order section wont purchase any product from nykaa worst experience.
"I have had a great experience with nykaa... I really love this app... I got 
my Mac Ruby woo In just 24hrs !!! Couldn't believe it.... Loved it..."

"Had a really bad experience. I had placed an order on 30th April, 2020. The order was to be delivered on 2nd May, 2020. But even today as on 18th May 2020 The order has not been delivered. And the reason they are saying that no contact has been estd. With the customer. However I have not recieved a single call from the courier partner Shadowfax."
Hey friends people will definitely doubt why 5 star but believe me guys ull get really good experience using NYKAA I am happy with their services and the products are really good if u get 1 or 2 less product in ur order is because they arrange but ull definitely received it next day this is what I had experienced.

Its an amazing experienceüòò
Always a good experience with nyka so far
Nykaa is just the best .. quick service... wonderful experience
Stupid service. Courier partner are worse. Give false experience and expectations
Worst Service. I have gone through your reviews recently and found you have so many critical reviews as same. You should really change the courier partner. trust me he's the one who is the reason behind most of it. I also ordered from nykaa and wanted my order delivered between 9 to 10:15 max. but they cannot deliver it to me and when I talked to them that I will collect it from your place they have a wrong address on Google. It was a really bad experience and my order is going to get cancelled.
Awesome experience in every shopping! Love Nykaa
awesome experience I have

"Have been using and shopping from nykaa over the past couple of years, the overall experience is really good. They are good with customer service as well. Overall a very good experience.."
Good experience
Money got debited from my account and order was not placed. there is no customer service number at help center. Worst online shopping experience.
Excellent experience so far. Keep up the good work.
Great experience
This is my first order through Nykaa. I liked the product range and hoping to have good experience shopping in Nykaa. Thanks.
"The shopping experience with Nykaa has been good so far. However,the 
returns are highly time talking and the process is cumbersome. The 
application return interface never works/ crashes in the middle. The mails 
facilitated returns are irritating as they are blindly generated templates. 
Despite of stating quarries clearly. They send same mails. Hence the 
complete shopping experience or overall experience is bad."
"Worst customer care experience till now.. yes they have wide range of products and discounts too.. additional discounts for prive members. But trust me if you have some issue... They are not going to resolve it. I am a online shopper since 6-7 years. But my worst experience of customer care is with nykaa... When you shop online, many time you get issues... I spoke to customer care, already mailed the issue and created ticket on chat.. no solution found till now."
wonderful and hassle free experience
Nice discounts and best delivery experience
"Worst experience as ordered product didnt get delivered while ordered it twice. Their so called delivery partner ""wow express"" have the worst delivery. To deliver and refund they take 2 weeks."
I always used This app for good product specially beauty products and sheet masks but today on 15th march I had a very bad experienced I've ordered 7 sheet mask which is on offer buy 7 get 7 free. But I only received 7 sheet mask.
Love theapp. Nice experience with nykaa all d time i hv purchased
Its a worst and very bad experience with it..i always a get a damaged product every time i trust u...i want my return back...

Great experience
"Worst customer service,worst experience.unprofrsstional delivery boy."
Great shopping experience!!
"Horrendous experience. They hire bullies for delivery services who simply call you up ""ordering"" you to pay them the money in cash- which btw you have had already paid online- and tell you that they won't deliver unless they are given cash. Good way for extortioning money from the customers. Ohh and not to forget they deliver damaged goods. It is better to order from anywhere else but nykaa. Would advice everyone to not use nykaa."
Be aware nykaa app is selling fake products..I faced horrible experience.and after you complain they do nothing.stop buying from nykaa app.
"Worst products, hidden clause n cheater serviceüò§üò§üò§ never buy from #Nykaa....i wish i could have given -0 rating....pathetic experience with nykaa....they are cheaters."
excellent experience
"Very good experience, but the otp section takes too much time around 20 to 25 minutes.. otherwise good experience"
I love this app a lot!!!Never felt cheated .Had a grt experienceü§ólove u Nykaa!!!
"Had a great experience,they offered great discount,i am happy"
pretty good experience n m happy to shop from nykaa....
incredible experience one point shop for all the beauty needs ... highly recommended üòä
I am really sorry nykaa I have to change my review from positive to negative... No doubt your products are awesome but what is the use if we'll not get them on time. I have placed my order on 16th October and today it's 2nd Nov it's been more than 15 days I am still waiting. I won't purchase anything from nykaa now onwards. Such a bad experience. Nykaa was my first choice to buy cosmetics but I have deleted nykaa now. Change your delivery partner wow express otherwise your future is in dark.
good experience
It's bone of the nicest apps i have ever used in my life...it carries all make up and skin care products with such offeres and also alk the things are damn original....so over all just awesome experience...love itüòçüòç
awsm experience..love nykaa
Very bad experience with nykaa.. they dont refund money promptly. ..false assurances.. pathetic delivery service... and never make a prepaid order with them..I am feeling cheated by nykaa .. don't use this app if you value your money.. Amazon is way better
Great experience i shared while shopping from nykaa. It will give you authentic and orignal products

Best shopping experience ever
Very good experience
Wrost experience. Never accept return very bad service. Deliver damaged products. So I would suggest don't buy products from nayaka.
My experience with Nykaa has been just amazing.. love to shop from this site..
Had a good experience of the products purchased from Nykaa til now. Would 100% recommend Nykaa to other people.
Worst app in regards to return a product. I always recommend this site to my friends and family members but since my last experience i won't use neither suggest it to anyone
"Great shoping experience, this is awesome apps nice service and easy returns.. thank you"
It's a wonderful experience for me
"Received completely leaked product, it is not packed properly and they say easy to return but they rejected to exchange such a worst experience on 1st order"
Very good experience with nykaa
Worst service...Pathetic unpleasant experience
"My personal view is shopping by Nykaa is a wonderful feeling,you get original products and the packing,delivery everything is just awesome, marvellous experience I must say,thankyou nykaa for being a part of so many women's life."
"best price on nykaa, delevry on time best best onlin shopping experience my favrt thank you nykaaa"
Very good experience for me
it has been wonderful experience with nykaa: Beauty ‚ù§Ô∏è
I love the experience
Thank u nyka..for such a convenient shopping experience...
worst experience..zero star...I received a wrong order and when I reported that to nykaa then they asked me to share the documents and said that it would take 2 to 3 days for processing. Now they have replied that they have delivered the right product from their end and so they cannot do anything about the issue now. The product I ordered was priced at rs 500 and the wrong product I received is of rs 200. I seriously believe that they consider there customer as fool. Highly disppointing.
Original products.. Till now experience is good
Its a superb app üëå.... The delivery is very fast within one day i got my stuff ..the packaging was very good ...the stuff i ordered was really nyc nd was in good condition .... overall its a wonderful app ...it was my first experience nd i m looking forward to order more products üòä
It's an excellent shopping experience from home with nykaa
"They will not refund the amount and even nobody is come to pickup the return product,if you r not satisfied with the product they will not going to help to at all because there is No direct customer care support uou have to talk to them on messages which is very horrible. Very bad experience NYKAAüëé"
Clean and flawless user experience!
Very nice experience üòäüòäüòäüòä
"Very poor customer service....unprofessional delivery person.. Worst 
shopping experience..."
Last experience waz awfull.. Due to shortage of staff in customer service
Terrible customer service. Bad experience. They even gobbled up my reward points and never credited it back.
I had a horrible experience with nykaa once again I had received a defective product and requested for a immediate pick up and a quick resolution but the chat support executive miss deepa had not assistef me and had literally ended the chat nykaa has horrible service and she is not ready to assist me at all this was completely unexpected she had disconnected the chat without my concent and when requested for a call from manager she said that would not be apt having such pathetic customer servic
Awesome app.. Awesome experience.. Using this app since last 4-5 years.. Never disappointed me.. All the product quality is up to the mark.. My all time favorite app for cosmetics shopping... 1 con.. : Please get Soumi's Can product into your stocks..
I love too shop on nykaa great experience love you nykaa
its a wonderful experience nykaa always give mi a good ofer and i enjoy all service
great experience everytime i order products
I have been shopping with this app for the last two-three years.I always had good experiences with it. On time Shipping/customer satisfaction/easy to find out your product. everything is perfect. I am verry happy with it .üëçüèª
Love the brands. clean interface. good discounts :)
I always had pleasant experience with nykaa
gr8 quality products n at worthy price fast dilevery service with good packing till ma experience with nykaa is awesome
"Horrible experience with the electronic equipment ordered via nykaa, both products turned damaged, now I am to contact directly to the company which is Braun. Rest got good experience with lipsticks and makeup items. I think I will stick to that and better to buy electric grooming items from the shops directly"
"I had ordered several items from Nykaa about a month back. Not only the delivery was very late, there was an item from Maybelline which was found to be missing from my package on opening it. But I had already paid the full bill including the price of the product I did not receive. I tried to contact Nykaa customer care but they did not even bother to  respond to my emails regarding refund/replacement of the missing item. It was a terrible experience and I have never expected to be cheated like this as I was a regular customer at this site. The customer care service was absolutely dismal."
Loved the experience
I have been buying stuff from nykaa through this app and my experience is good. I highly recommended this app.
real products nd genuine.... i haven't received my current order but through last experience ......nykaa gives genuine nd worth products with good prices
Awesome experience
My experience with Nykaa is really good ....and above all what ever products i have ordered and received are genuine.love it.
This is me trying out Nykaa for the first time and i must say i had the worst delivery experience. App like Flipcart and Amazon's delivery services are way better than nykaa's.
Awesome experience
I have good experience till now but not that great experience with the service chat as the response was very slow and I hope I get my query solved soon
Shopping experience is good but i feel the review section should be more elaborated like photos can be added by people for better experience.
"I had wonderful experience of shopping with this app, easy to find your loved products and always let you track the orders."
It's a very genuine site. Love to shopping from nykaa. Good experienceüòä
Good experience.Easy to order
"NykaaüòçüòçI really love this app..I never ever in my entire life ordered anything online from any app...my first ever was nykaa..and my experience was amazing..delivery, packaging, prices.. everything is really really good..I would really appreciate if nykaa introduces brands like glamlite, urban decay, colourpop and Anastasia Beverly hills ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è I'll be sure to buy things from these brands;) and I think many more people will also appreciate.‚ù§Ô∏è"
horrible experience...i think they send fake products i ordered matte lipsticks twice and they are not even matte do they have original products... really annoyedüò°
Love the experience!
Best experience.. luv the app.. I am using this app from very long tym all the products are original nd affordable also delivery process is very easy
Nice experience
It's a really good app for self-care products. I'm happy using it since a long time now. And please kindly fix the bug which hinders user's experiences by not letting us to track our items.
Good user experience
great experience got products at reasonable prices and low from market price packaging of goods was also very good
Worst app ive ever used..... I demanded to return my damaged product and they have put my request on hold.... Very bad experience
"I received a wrong product and when asked for a refund , they gave me an invalid coupon. Worst experience."
great experience n search for almost all products.
"I'm using nyka since November 2018, and I really have good experience with this app. I can easily buy any Beauty products here and ofcourse can return them it found any issue with the item. it's really a helpful for a person who don't like to go out to market and shop....I love it"
Very amazing experience ..offers for..care of every woman's penny
"I got old stocks, I have ordered 9 products in that lotus compact was damaged n inside powder was totally crushed, now on no online shopping, bad experience üò°"
worst . Bad experience.they delay delivery time day by day. No attempt was made.not even a phone call from delivery boy and they just showed failed delivery. .Their services are very poor.they don't deserve a single star.if u don't want to send my order.its ur problem.eveytime create a problem frm ur side.i have more options to buy.
Awesome experience with Nykaa üòç original product
"Nykaa is the best Go to app for all your skin care products, the products are from reliable brands and affordable without compromising the quality. It's always a great experience shopping in Nykaa‚ù§Ô∏è"
Excellent experience
"Its always an amazing experience shopping here on Nykaa....I love the quality, and the service....it has throughly made my life so simple and easy going, as I find all the products here without compromising quality, also quite pocket friendly as well....love u so much Nykaa....üòä‚ò∫üíñ"
"Bad Customer Centricity, Pathetic Delivery experience. Six items has been ordered at the same time for a same delivery location but three has been delivered within time line but rest three has not been delivered even after almost 15days. There was no call, mail either from Nykaa or their delivery partner. Even there was no direct way to communicate with their customer team. Eventually they will loose customers. Really ridiculous ü§£ü§£"
Have ordered twice and have had a great experience on each purchase. Keep it up Nykaa :-)
"If there was a way to give stars in negative, i would do that. This review is not so much about the app but the service and the pathetic customer experience. Never will I , my family or my friends order anything from Nykaa anymore. I'm so done."
I have always had a great experience with Nykaa. Their products are genuine and their delivery is super fast !
"I have always been a good customer of nykaa, ordered almost every month. But this time when I got a damaged product they were not accepting the request. After so much request when they accepted, it's been two weeks they have not dispatched the return. Worst experience! Their customer care service responds in hours and also they responded that please reach us later our server is not responding :) ...congratulations nykaa for losing your customer üëè"
You can't cancel your order. Worst experience
Good experience
Amazing experience so far ... Quick delivery and amazing product quality .
"I placed the order on 5th oct and items got delivered on 17th..i havent 
experienced such delayed delivery from any other online shopping."
worst experience ever.... delivery is below average.. customer service is a disaster. If they can't understand how things work for a normal human being how come they are running the brand!!!
Nice experience
Good experience
great experience with Nyka..good packaging..fast service..
Best experience ever..
best quality products and great experience with exchange nd return programs.. also u get huge discounts nd offers on brands
Its always a wonderful experience shopping with u......when it comes to cosmetics I can trust only u for genuine products‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
"A wrong product has been delivered to me & its over one week i m mailing them for the replacement  but no relevent respond there side, never recommend any1 for this app. Very annoying experience."
good experience. variety of items
"Hate this app i have ordered on 9th of june and today it is 19th but still 
there is no update. No service at all worst experience"
Great experience!!
Its an good experience
I am really upset by the way you guys handle the delivery. The courier guys from wow express come to deliver at office after 9 pm when there is no one. They domt even call and say that consignee is not reaponding. Your customer care officials say mam wait in the office the courier is reachi g you. Do you expect me to do that? I am rating you one star because of this pathetic experience every time i shop from you guys. Very irresponsible tram nykaa
I have good experience with nykaa
I've shopped many times and it's been a very good experience untill now.
Great experience with nyka... authentic products and amazing packaging and delivery but discounts are low
I have great experience with till date... Its really easier for me to get genuine products at my doorstep without any problem. I have only one complaint or request yo nykaa to avail COD delivery even if I shop for less than ‚Çπ500...
best experience ‚ù§Ô∏è
it's a great experience. all in one platform but yeah sometimes bit expensive. you should give some more offers. overall it's amazing experience with nykaa.
Very good experience ..Quality products
Till now Lovely experience.. üß°üß°
Love this app and everything skin related products available. I am using this since 3 years excellent experience.
good experience
My experience with nykaa is awesome..I can trust nykaa only in matters of beauty products. But I want to request nykaa to reduce minimum order size of ‚Çπ500 only as it was earlier so small customers like me can be able to buy more frequently..
Very worst experience with nykaa...i ordered product on 23rd oct n till now i did'nt receive my product...hr dn customer care ko cll kr k pu6te rho k product kb ayega unlog ko v ni malum rhta h ku6...really vry disappointed with nykaa..worst shopping experience
Nice Experience... For this app we are getting all the international products sitting at home.. thanks to Nykaa for making it possible
First time shop with nykaa but my experience was not good...nykaa have certificate that they sell only original product but I didn't receive what i exactally order..... And there refund service are very poor they don't have stafff to take back the parcel....very disappointed with the service ...not happy with nykaa
"Why do Nykaa put offers/ freebies when it is not interested in sending them to customers.  The paid orders would be packaged as one and one of the freebie would be packed separately to which there has not been an update since 3 days post replacing order.  I have been regularly asking for a update regarding my order, and the team is either busy in postponing or want to store/ save it to put it again on the next sale. One of the worst experience. Disappointed by Nykaa services."
"awsm experience with dis app. never disappointed .,."
"it's always a great experience shopping with nykaa, satisfied with the product and services."
Overall good experience
"best shopping app,delighted experience. Packaging of the products is amazing. And the products are of course suber. Love nykaaüòòüòò."
This is my first experience that have got from Nykaa. I have some Hand Sanitizers ordered on 26th July 2020 confirmed me product delivery with in 28th july 2020 and today 31st july 2020 no any product nor any refund have received from nykaa when checked my status shows product returned from the end of courier service and at present status not updated from 28 th july 2020 really I have disappointed very badly box the product is very important to me in this pendamic time. Customer care very poo
"Large range or brands, effective and fast delivery, easy to use Overall its a great experience to use it.üòäüòäloved it"
Great experience üòä
awesome experience
superb the experience of the nykaa
Very bad app...they mark my thing delivered bt not delivered yet..through ph dey said dey will giv back the photo bt nt given...one word very much faltu castomer care services...worst experience...
Very good experience
"Wide range of products available at your doorstep, smooth delivery and good packaging. Overall good experience so far"
WORST DELIVERY!! Since 4 days it is showing the status 'out for delivery' &'failed delivery' one after the other! You people are wasting customer's time & testing their patience. I called the courier partner several times the call didn't connect but my balance got almost empty! It cost me 2Rs/- for each call I made even though call didn't got connected! Worst experience from nykaa! Courier partner didnt even attempt for delivery nor they are picking up the call. Where are them? Are they dead?
What a bad experience. I ordered a sunglasses which was costly first they delivered it so late than when i got the product the product was so cheap it's not even worth 100.. And then i requested a return so they approved my requested forster than cancelled now all my money has been wasted the product is so. Bad that u can't wear it. Never shopping again from here
"The product range offered is good. However, delivery service is horrible. I paid for 2 orders. Both orders had 2 delivery shipments each. One of the shipments gave a wrong product and it is taking more than 2 weeks to get the correct one. Another shipment didn't deliver- the delivery guy gave my order to the wrong person. Moreover, the app shows this shipment is delivered! The option of rating delivery doesn't work. Terrible experience!"
wonderful experience
"I have been using this app extensively for over a year now. My experiences 
so far are favourable in all departments."
Very bad experience
awesome experience... original products for sure
"continuously had to undergo worst experience due to their cheap delivery 
partners. very much disappointed and unsatisfied with the ridiculous 
reasons. Is'nt a medical college a valid landmark?My friends got their 
delivery from nykaa to the same address through the same delivery service 
few days back. Even after complaining the problem there is no change. I 
think losing customers is not a great deal for you."
great experience using this app .....verified original productsüëå
Best shopping experience ....
I'm loving this experience. became an old customer now and don't have any complain so far. products are original and reaches my place on time. Their return policy is also great. A pic of the unsatisfactory product is all they need. Thank you so much Nykaa for being my everyday partner.
this time its a worst experience wid nayka.i shopped frm nayka so many times but this time i am very dissapointed wid their service.its been more than 12 days stil i havent recived my parcel. its shows failed delivery coz they cannot find adress but i to my surprise coz same courier blue dart deliverd me damaged product and now for one they cannot find adress even their courier boy havent called us just show failed delivery.orderd several times frm nayka never faced such prbl with WOW service.üëé
oswammmüòçüòçüòç experience thanks Nykaa
Nice experience while pur3for the very first time.. Thank you Nykaa.
"Good product, excellent experience"
Overall good experience
Nice experience
Experience very good i love it
"I have a horrible experience with Nykaa customer service. I placed my first order with Nykaa, and the product even reached my city. However, the delivery team marked it as ""unable to contact me so failed to deliver"". The delivery team didnt even try to contact me. What is the purpose of ordering online if the product doesnt even reach us."
Good experience...
bad experience with nayaka.they cheated on me.i order for shampoo and conditioner combo pack one month before but they can't provide it after two or three times chat with their costmer care cell i cancel my order but i didn't get my money back.very disappointed with naayka.this was my first and last purchase with naayka
good experience
"This is the best app,I have ever seen because most of the things from so many well known brands are available and the app guarantees the authenticity.Also the delivery is also fast,what I have experienced is 10 days maximum.Overall it is so awesome."
Wide collection of beauty products. Nice interface

Amazing Experience...Highly Recommend this appüëç
Great experience with nykaa.
Excellent experience
I wish i had an option of Negative rating! They are bunch of frauds. Their customer service is the worst. Shop from them only if you want to loose your money and peace of mind because they will never deliver your products and keep your hard earned money with them. That is their way of earning money! Shut down Nykaa. Useless company!! Cant even handle sale. Worst customer experience i ever had with a company!
"Lovely experience,"
Pathetic experience n app...wid an unprofessional customer care..this is exactly what I have been feeling abt u guys and it's been a month and nobody has replied back..i have written back to ur support team but all that I get is please rate us...no inconvenience discount or order delivered to me....still waiting and it is been a month.. Highly pathetic customer service...please do not act as if u guys care
"Amazing experience and great discounts too ,they ship it so fast and customer support is really superb."
Very nice...great experience..
Worst Worst Worst experience ever. Due to technical error of their app the coupon got expired and no refund on the same. Wouls never ever ise this again.
Loved the products..loved the experienceüòÅ
"My experience with Nykaa is always amazing, the range of products is super, original products with immediate delivery and CODs always available, simply love it"
very good experience with nyka
It is very nice experience to shop from Nykaa.The products are available at lesser rate with genuine quality.Sometimes order is delayed and cancelled itslef which should be taken care of.
Worst experience
This is about my recent experience. I ordered few products before lockdown and during the whole lockdown I just understood the problem that due to lockdown they are not able to deliver my order but it's been many days when the deliveries are on for my pin code and my order still not arrived though I wrote 4 mail on the possible websites and got the pathetic reply. Now neither I am getting my order not they are cancelling it.
lovely experience
Amazing experience
Great experience ‚ò∫‚ò∫
I had a great experience with this app .. it's super convenient and trustworthy. But today I am having trouble opening the app .. hope it gets alright soon I need to order something very urgently.
worst experience ever ive been waiting for one product for about 4months a d once i have seen the stock is available ive ordered in within seconds ..but ivenot got the delivery whereas its showing as we have tried calling you and delivery failed whereas ive not got any call regarding this.. nyka is even replying
"Placed an order and never received it. No one picks customer care number , also no one replied to mails. Payment was also done before hand, so money also never came back. Worst experience!"
Good experience
"Fantastic experience every time shop with you guys, just love it"
Good experience till date. Provides authentic products.‚ù§Ô∏è

Experience with nykaa has been good till now.their packaging of products is specially worth mentioning....rather it is commendable....I have always received the products intact..no spilling no breakages in the nykaa delivery boxes unlike other reputed e-commerce websites
Nyka gives me super experience but I think they need improvement regarding customer service
Convenient shopping experience.
it's an awsm experience. I learn a lot of things there.the only problem is it charges shipping if not purchased for an amount of 500 at least.
great experience with nykaa plz soon open your store in himachal also
awesome experience
Good Experience and the products are original.
5 times I tried placing an orders 3 times from mobile and 2 times from pc everytime it shows order number and when we try to open my order they say no orders placed....customer support is also worst in short everything about nyka is worst my 1st experience is worst
Great Experience... And they send original brand at good price ... Nykaa have daily deals... I am very happy after unsing... ‚ò∫
wonderful experience with nyka. Wherever i goes they are available. Giving nyka 4star means they can improve more.
Great experience while shopping with nykaa.....it allows to get best deals and most suitable app for all kind of cosmetic...thanks for providing good quality product....delivery on time.....at best priceüòäüòäüëç

Wonderful experience with you Nykaa!!
I ordered online Haven't received yet Calling Customer care no. Is useless ( do u even hire a customer care executive  because no one picks up the call) Worst experience till now HELP HELP HELP
What a app..! No option for choosing tick and sign up. I can imagine how will be the rest experience.  Bravo!
Experience with Nykaa has always been great! Just love the variety n range of products offered. Worth it!üòä
Pathetic experience ever customer service is more pathetic
Good experience
great experience üôÇ
It's really amazing app but Worst delivery experience Please don't send orders with xpressbees
Excellent experience
Really good experienceüòä
"I had a very bad experience with your courier service, Blue Dart. The delivery boy seems not so interested in delivering the product to the consumer. Nykaa help center is also not listening to the problem. Most disgusting customer care service. My worst experience ever on a e commerce portal. Don't install the app and order from NYKAA!"
love the shopping experience üåà
"Excellent app and service !! Didn't have any bad experience yet !! Genuine good quality products and easy returns ! Totally addicted to this, although my husband hates it :p :D Great job Team Nykaa ‚ù§"
Experience with Nykaa has been amazing
"My experience with nykaa is always best even though i visited nykaa stores , love this app as wide range of products available here"
very bad experience with nykaa. I given my 1st order on nykaa on 9th September and I have already paid for it but the order is still not delivered. I called customer care nine times they said order will be delivered by tomorrow but there is no any such tomorrow till date.
Never had any issue with this app.. great experience!
awesome experience.... delivered on time...
Wonderful experience.....amazing range of products....love to do shopping....
Very bad experience.. my desired product is out of stock..first time order..
"The App is good, user friendly interface. Search option works well. Overall simple and very easy to useüëç"
superb experience
good experience throughout
"Very bad experience,I ordered 3 things out of which 2 products r damaged , i raised a return request but there is no response , poor Customer service , DISAPPOINTED...!!"
Very good experience with nyka..... Trustworthy
Good experience
FRAUD!!!! Heavily unreliable. Tried to force a delivery at my default address when the order was supposed to be delivered in another city. The customer service is the most pathetic and unclear source of information. Unacceptable how irresponsible Nykaa is with people's money. Definitely buying only from Myntra or other alternatives but never Nykaa after this harassing experience.
awesome app...with great experience..üòç
Genuine products...fast delivery...great experience
I'm happy for buy that's product with no shipping charges and so many discount than market prizeüòä .....lovey experience ü§ó TnQq Nykaa for available many product for comman people..üòä hope product will be good....
Worst experience in buying beauty products online. Product doesn't match with the images shown and you can not return the product as well. It's like you have to keep the product anyway. Why would I use the product which does not match to my choice???
Great experience and genuine products
"Wonderful experience price is less compare to others ,good offers in brand items & maintain quality & original product sale with trust.love it NYKAAüòç."
Great shopping experience üòä
Love the Nykaa experience. ü§©
I'm just love this application and every Girl have to admire and love this...awesome experience Thank you and Love From Kolkata (India üáÆüá≥)
My experience with nyka was very bad I ordered nyka luxe products worth 5800 . I received all products were broken when I raised a complaint against my order for replacement they are not giving a proper response. It's my suggestion do not trust this app. I had a very horrible experience.
"Prepaid order undelivered. No delivery attempt made, no call nothing yet 
tracking status of my order shows I was not available. Continuously trying 
to connect through the live chat feature, so many tickets were raised yet 
no response given. Called the courier service no response. Called nykaa 
cuatomer care , after listening to the whole issue I am told to write the 
same issue in mail. Did that. Yet no revert. I had placed my order on 12 
august and today is 20 August. After all the delay the order was supposed 
to be delivered on 18 august and again, not delivered, instead it shows 
attempt was made and I was not available. What a stupid behavior. 
Unprofessional. Pathetic service. Horrible experience."
I have experience delay all the time I have placed order. customer has to always keep track and call them to move the order. No proper justification regarding the delay.No discounts also
"Excellent experience I like the variety to choose from, at the same time not getting bombarded with anything and everything. User friendly app. Quick delivery."
Worst ever! All they shows is the offers when 1 place an order in offer they canceled the main product and delivered only half the products. And every time orders get canceled without even my concern after making me wait for a week. If the order or offer cannot be fulfilled why even trying to fake sell it or why aren't you stating while ordering it. Poor shopping experience.
best experience
"Awsome experience , always loved to shop from Nykaa"
Worst site. Dont buy products from here . If you had an issue with the product they will not return the product. Very bad experience from nykaa
great experience
"Pathetic experience. No idea when the products would come. Even when delivered, delivered wrong products. Now no news of replacement. Even customer care number is not given. No one replies on email...worst app seriously. Dont know why so many ppl like it."
Very bad experience... I ordered the product but I received only one product... After sending opening video of the they didn't response correctly..... I will never order from this site now.
"Worst delivery guys with this. They never call you back and never come with 
change. I ordered two things worth 654 and he didnt even had change for 1k. 
He said will take change and come back. U called him like hell lot of 
times. But that idiot didnt bother to pick the call. Do i have only work to 
sot and wait for him. I have other things to do . Cant sit and wait for him 
whole day. I personally had worst experience so far from Nyka. You guys 
have worst delivery tie ups. Please work upon it. I need my order to placed 
sooner. And I won't say thanks. Hell experience. Never complained ever like 
this for any service."
Delightful experience...
fabulous shopping experience hope you increase the brands
"Its was a pretty damn good experience , never thought about a app for all tha grooming kits .best experience till now."
"Amazing Services as always ‚ù§Ô∏è Have been shopping from Nykaa website and through stores constantly since three years, never had a bad experience in any kind of service üíïüòç"
Good experience
Wonderful experience
All my experiences with Nykaa have been positive will continue to do business with them in the future
awesome experience
I must say worst experience I have with Nykaa now either the products are missing or sometimes the products are damaged this was the last time I have shopped with Nykaa. If this continues you are going to loose all your customers with time.

Great experience to take nykaa app. Best quality products have on this nykaa aap. Really best ever product on nykaa in comparison all online shopping app.
not too good experience...
"Had a horrible and unpleasant experience, your customer care service really sucks, the ""care"" in your customer care service don't really exists. You don't care about the problems your customers are facing. And also you people have forgotten to put return or replacement button in your app. Pathetic service ever. One day due to such service you are going to face a huge downfall. You are pathetic, a big no to your products and shame on your customer care service. All my hate to nykaa."
"Very bad experience....I got a scam call in the name of nykka...they got all details my address ,phone, number even the product details...I don't trust this app anymore"
Nice experience
Received bad quality product and they rejected my return request too! So disappointed #badexperience Never gonna shop again from Nykaa

Very bad service!!! Delivered me a wrong product and then denied to return it. First and last and the worst experience.
"The tracking of orders is awful, my order was late and the tracking option wasn't working in the app. Worst experience of online shopping for me"
Good experience üòäüòä
good experience.
The shopping experience was very nice but they take a lot of time to refund the amount.I have still not received my refund and it's been more than 5 working days. So really disappointed regarding that. Otherwise it's an amazing app.
Nice experience with Nyka
have got wonderfull experience with nykaa...
"This is the 1st time I'm ever reviewing something on playstore that too 1Star because of your after sale services.My order was not taken into concern,there was no notice for my order getting delayed,I'm so much frustated right now to even review the products or even rate you guys! I have always praised Nykaa for delivery and services,my last order was also delayed but that was neglible coz you guys kept me updated but my this purchase made my experience horrible on Nykaa. Really disappointed:("
Great experienceüëç
i have the best shopping experience with nykaa. thank you so much nykaa. i just love your care
Bad experience...cod above 1200/- is poor sense as well as free shipping 700 is the worst
quick delivery.. overall grt experience
"The experience in wow, products are too good"
Very Good experience shopping with nyka. Good app for buying beauty products at reasonable price üòä
Amazing experience yrr mindblowing they have customer friendly interface and amazing range of products
"I ordered lipstick last week and 2 days after the purchase date I saw a message that my product has been delivered on the app, but I did not receive it. I'm constantly following up on my product or refund but the contact center is unable to give me a resolution. This is the first time I ordered from nykaa and this has been a very disappointing experience. Very poor customer service & lengthy process for resolving customer complaint. Hope someone senior in Nykaa is reading this feedback"
Very very worst experience because too late and too slow for deliver the product now I feel bad that why m order from nayka...very bad need to improvement
"So I had a really terrible experience with the delivery process and agent too. I had to sent few mails, place call and finally change address which I'm sure is not possible for everyone. Nykaa please update your delivery process and the agents need to be more efficient and professional. The products are otherwise good and even better with the offers."
"Excellent experience, vast range & brands, great deals, authentic products, totally love the shopping experience :)"
"Reliable and Recommendable Nykaa has always delivered as far as in my experience with it very efficiently , the one less star out of 5 would be for the product outcome but still whatever it is basic essential to cosmetices it's good , the best part is the service which is always up to the mark , production , dustrubution and delivery"
Had a great experience uptill now
It ws very gud experience to buy from naykaüòÄüòÄ..
My experience with this app is awesome. Really good and very good products I can trust them blindly.

"I just received my first order and I have to say, it was awesome. My first experience with nykaa was not as I expected bcz I read a lot of bad reviews. But guess what! No used products, no expired or about to expire products, only good and new ones. The delivery was also 2 days early! Packaging was so careful and pretty I am keeping it allüòÄ. Thank you Nykaa!

good experience
The app is quite erratic. Seems to have a mind of its own. The app Logs out by itself randomly and very frequently. And most of the time it says requested operation failure or cannot be completed while trying to log in. Shopping experience is great otherwise
good experience..
worst experience ever! u wont get the same order u paid for..when u wanna return they claim its used even if its not.. n sometimes u get broken items and they still claim u did it
I would have given this app a 5 star because it provides original products just because of a bad experience with delivery i gave a e star.
Very good experience nice app
Good experience
"worst experience ever had.maximum time delivering used old products and asking more photos to return and exchange.we dont have that much time thats why we are buying online,dont ask for more pictures while returning and exchnging"

Good shopping experience from nykaa
Good experience
my experience was good with nykaa
Very bad experience..order not delivered..order cancelled by the company without my permission.
Had a great experience on this app...nice products...
Awesome experience!
amazing experience
Great experience. You can buy entire makeup collection at one place. And the products are genuine too. Love to nykaa.
My experience soooo gd...üòäüòäüòäüòä
Always good experience.
Worst experience. They returned my order and didn't refund after so many days. Never going to purchase again.
Pathetic experience. They don't keep their promise to deliver the products on time. Customer support is equally bad as they only make false assurances to deliver within 24-48 hours. I never recieved the products I ordered on 28th Aug 2019.
Good experience
My experience was amazing...thank u nykaa
"The best beauty and make up online shopping website, Loved my shopping experience on nyka gives great variety of make up product with discounts. You can choose products according to your skin type and tone"
wonderful experience ... trusted app
amazing experience shopping with Nykaaüòçüòã‚ù§ Thank you for providing such a good serviceüòä
"Worst experience ever.. SUCH CHEATS have never seen!I have placed an order in Nykaa on 4th Oct 2020 and even till 12th oct 20 i have not received any order. The order was already paid and now on 13th morning, i am receiving a text stating the order is already delivered.However on enquiring the security person, I got to know that no one came from the stated courier partner to deliver the package from Nykaa So now the question is whom the package got delivered when the person didn't enter premisis"
Love the shopping experience and range of products!
"For first few purchases the experience was good but then its not less than any nightmare. I places an oede on 17th October, half of the items got delivered and half of them are still pending. The reason mentioned in app is the Pin code is wrong.I am not able to understand then how the other items got delivered at the same address.. When I am trying to raise the concern using the app after adding the comment its not letting me save it..I mean Wow.. Another order of mine is also not delivered yet"
App works well now. Filters and searches work very well. Good user experience
"wonderful experience if you want to buy a whole range of beauty products , you just have to search and then everything is just in front of you . This app proved to be best for beauty products"
Packaging is good... Products are genuine and loved the experience. Especially happy for Korean products... Hope they will keep more Korean brands.
nyc experience
Pathetic experience. Expired products are delivered during sale. Customer care executive doesnt replace or refund the product and refuses to help. Will never recommend to use this.
Very good experience with you my nykaa. Thanks for the discount
My first experience is awesome. The product is delivered in 24 hours with secured packing.  Loved it...
excellent experience
Services are too delayed.. after placing order it shows that within 24 to48 hrs it will be shipped but even after 4 days no update no clarity no shipment.. nothing..nykka must work on their services.. must deliver what they claim.. pathetic app.. worst experience with this app
"got an unsealed ,used(tester) product...never expecting this from nyka.. bad experience"
nice experience about nykaa good product collect ion
By far great experience
This is the worst app . Please don't download this worst app bcoz ........... It will charge you extra money of the product than MRP . Believe me it's my experience I have ordered a product and it's MRP was 105 and they have charged 115 from me for that product ......... That's why I only have one star but They even doesn't deserve 1 star 'Worst app ever' They will charge extra money Don't download....
"It was very good experience, especially they tell you about offers again and again while adding things into the bag and because of that i didn't pay delivery charges and I got one more product in shipping amount. Thank you Nykaa ‚ô•Ô∏è"
Worst experience from past two orders.. This site shows and offer on ordering a product and when you do that they don't include that offer not even update you that offer is not valid.. They show fake offers on their app when you get the product they don't even include that and say that offer is over... Why don't you guys remove that offer showing on your site when you can't deliver it.
Is very nice experience all product are very good ‚ù§
good experience
Wonderful experience üòç
"So far good experience..! You people are doing a great jobüëç Many products

I m happy with nykaa experience
excellent experience
having a good experience with authenticity
It's really the best app ever! I have a good experience of nykaa even we all have a nykaa assistant really this app is amazing and All the best Nykaa for your future !
Worst customer service ever experienced.
Nykaa does a good job but their courier partners are horrible. Thanks for the horrible experience!
The experience is extremley good. Thr best shopping app but please try and deliver all products together in one go rather than delivery products one by one
"Probably THE BEST fashion shopping app out there. Product variety, user interface, payments, everything is great hassle-free! Implementation of Gift-box is great too! Highly recommended."
Good experience
"they have all products which I want, n I love the experience"
i have awesome experience i love it thanks for nyka. They have good services nd good product
"Excellent app. make-up buying made easy,enormous brand option. I only request you guys please stock up sold out things quickly. waiting for something to stock back is annoying. Rest awesome shopping experience"
"Pathetic experience.. the product doesn't delivers in time even after 
multiple reminders. Pathetic nykaa and their partnership courier!"
Good experience üòä
Awesome app where you experience all brands at one roof
Very bad service worst experience.
"Such a bad experience... The delivery date is already over and my parcel 
hasn't reached yet..nd still to add to troubles they haven't activated the 
track link...horrible experience.. Will never order again"
Wonderful‚ú®üòç experience.
"5 star for the past shopping experience but now the service to arunachal and assam has been stopped, could you please resume it asap. Coz i have a lot of products in my cart."
"Impressive! Would suggest to deliver the lip products same as shown in the pictures. Experienced different shades than ordered thrice. Also, return policy needs to be improved. There are few products which cannot be returned until they are seen."
very bad app. my first time experience is very poor. i didn't receive my order till now i have ordered it 10 days back and haven't received it yet
"Shopping with Nykaa has been one of the best experiences I've ever had. The packaging was great, the delivery was fast and moreover I loved the products. I've already shopped twice from nykaa. But from the past few weeks it keeps saying that "" It doesn't ship to my pincode "" every time I enter my pincode. I don't understand what's wrong with the app or the services. But I'm really sad about this. Can you please fix this. I really look forward to shop from nykaa."
Till now good experience
It's a great experience with Nykaa‚ô•Ô∏è
Amazing Experience
Great experience with nykaa
It was great experience with purchase from nykaa
I have great experience with nykaa...the genuine app...I just want to give an advice if u give 'add items' option before shipment it will be better..if someone fogt to order something and want to take that product in same shipping that's option will be helpful
Best experience alwaysüíù
awesome experience as everytime
"Changing my review from 4 stars to 1 star only because of the delivery system that nykaa offers. Even in a metropolitan city , nykaa dosent have a good delivery system . I've had worst past and present experience, where delivery person dosent call the customer in the first place, later says that customer wasn't picking call. And other times , they weren't able to find the address , why wouldn't delivery person call the customer if he wasn't able to find the address?? Isn't that a common sense ??"
Amazing experience every time
Always a great experience with nykaa
Very good service. A variety of brands available. The user interface is really good. It makes the browsing of all the products quite easy and convenient.
Amazing shopping experience!!!So many brands and the offers are super ammaazzing...lovu Nykaa...have been using this outstanding app and is really very much satisfied with it....
I have a very bad experience with nykaa. Due to it's popularity I gave back to back 2 orders. But till now I haven't received my package even 2 days prior to the promised date. Never shop at nykaa.
good experience
Great experience. fun shopping
"The product I ordered was good but Very bad service From nykaa call centre 
executive.. very bad . first experience very bad"
"I wanted to give a negative rating which is not possible. Worst customer service experience. They sell near to expiry products , don't respond back to emails, their customer base suggests that all fools have found a paradise."
Best site...if u want quality in products..my experience is ...good. i recommend u to try it once.
"I had a concern , regards to my order . And wanted to return \replace the item. But there was no response from the support team and neither my order is being replaced or returned. My first order from Nykaa Fashion , and an unpleasant experience."
Awesome experience..ü§ò
Worst delivery service I have ever experienced. They don't deliver the products at all and simply reply our delivery person could not reach you. This happened to me twice. They don't even deserve one star.
i love nykaa....my first experience with it was super cool....and d delivery was fast and i got all d products i wanted....in short i'm very much satisfied in my first experience with nykaa...thanks nykaaüôÇ
Delighted Experience
Nice experience
Great experience
I had a great experience.
In this covid 19 circumstances with nykaa my experience is very bad as they cut delivering charge in refund for cancelled orders.
"Loved it!! Must try , get great experiences . Truly satisfied with this app."
experience fast delivery
One stop for cosmetic!! Grt experience!! Genuine products!! ‚ù§Nayka!!
I had the worst shopping experience. I have purchased a product on 8th may and it's not shipped. They don't even give you an explanation. They don't even have any concern for customers.
"I love this app. Can almost not live without it. The customer service is 
slightly disorganised but has solved every issue I've ever had. A positive 
experience overall."
experience is superb.. so many brands with exiting offers under one roof....
I enjoyed shopping with this app.. Had a great experience
A regular customer but had a very poor experience with the service recently. I had ordered an L.A. Girl's contour stick which came broken. The product was returned but I never got the refund.
I have always had good experience buying here. products are genuine with good discounts and offers
Great experience!
i loved the experience at nykaa
Nice shopping experience üòä
"Easy to use, overall grt experience"
Often there won't be COD options for mah current address and offer prices are really amazing for popular brands its really helpful I really loved the first experience good packaging Nd ordered second time waiting to receive themü§©
Wonderful experience.
The experience with Nykaa is always just lovely...
Wonderful experience shopping wid nykaa..
Overall experience was v good
Very good experience
It was great experience searching suitable products with reviews made it easy.
I love Nykaa for it's fast delivery experience
"Wow experience, quick delivery nd easy return"
"Good experience shopping with nykaa, but prices are high compared to Amaozon"
"They did not deliver all the products that were ordered and when asked several times about it, they didn't respond. They didn't even take up the case. And provided no evidence about actually packing the products.Terrible experience. The offers are luring and deceptive. The customer service is beyond terrible. And logging into the app is impossible. They password is somehow always wrong and the change password link never works. They don't even reply to emails. Last time using this app. Very poor."
It's a very smooth experience so far and cash on delivery really comes in handy since i don't owe a card so it's very fascinating plus it also a pocket friendly too plus products are 100% genuine
Very be experience I can make order to nykaa but podcast is damej but products was not replace or not refund After one month and more
"I have very bad experience with nykaa. 2 times i experienced late delivery. After all that i ordered again but they returned the item without my knowledge and also they never refund my money, they said they will return soon but no response"
"I am Nykaa's customer for 2-3 years and it has been wonderful experience. Swift delivery, easy payment methods, lots of offers, genuine products. Very happy with the service. keep it up"
I love to shop with Nykaa.geniun products.with on time delivery Thanks Nykaa for such a great shopping experience
Best Experience Yet! Enjoy your shopping with best price and on all your favorite brsnds are available here. Nykaa having super quality products for us. With the best quality i enjoyed my shopping. üôÇüëå‚ù§
Its a good experience
Seriously the customer service of nykaa is useless. Nobody has information about the current order status neither they try to assist you. Just kept writing what's already available on App itself. Ordered from pink sale. From which one product is intransit for ages and the freebie has not even dispatched after 6 days. Such a worst experience
Very good experience loved this app very muchüòçüòç
Awesome experience everytime..
Such a worst experience... Can i return this bottle? because i found empty bottle of kaya pigmentation reduction complex? why you cheating with the customer Nykaa's members? i hve lost my money and time.üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üëäüëäüëäüëä
worst experience.. i did not receive any call and the product as been automatically returned never gonna order from here
"The worst experience ever! I am a prive member, still I don't get the benefits for being a prive member. Moreover in my last order the cod took extra money and after calling the customer executive several times, there was no response. The customer executive said that my complaint is being registered and all but everytime they said the same thing and ultimately I didn't get any solution. Totally disappointed!!!"
Great experience shopping with nayka......
I love shopping on this app and am content with how they are reaching people with so many options and choices but i have a lot of grievances as well specially with the faulty delivery and customer care . I have had quite a few bad experiences with it but gave benefit of doubt all the time but everytime it gets more disappointing.
My experience with nykaa is always great
Truely unsatisfied with Nykaa.. for the 1st time i purchased.. and the experience was worst..
I will describe my experience after receiving my order ....as it is my first order
"Amazing experience evert time with Nykaa,just love it."
"worst app so far ..horrible experience, defective products ,hectic return, worst customer service...request you all never to order anything from this useless app.Thug app !!"
Huge range of products. Reliable purchases. Awesome shopping experience!
Seamless experience
Good experience
Beautiful experience with nyka shopping
worst experience i have ordered hair brush straightener it was second hand it was used....no reply no return nothing..
Amazing experience with Nykaa best quality products & faster delivery.. Thank you for being thereüéâü§ò‚ù§Ô∏è
"Your app has spoilt me to the core.. just love it so much.. it has amazing user friendly interface.. absolutely adore the never ending variety.. üòçü§ó Would love to see more of international skin care brands- cerave, the ordinary, inkey list.. You guys are my go to for anything.. Love you to the moon and back ‚ù§"
very bad experience i found items at less price on other apps then nykaa i ordered 2 diffrent orders from nykaa both were fail at first i received a damaged pacakage and the 2nd order they spilt it and gave me items one by one and even crossed the estimate dilevery date even coustumer care was helpless as i contact 2 diffrent persons
Nice experience till now
nykaa my one of best my experience is to good iam very happy for nykaa
Awsm experience
I love Nykaa app because it has a huge range of cosmetics and the searching algorithm is greatly designed that it enhances the shopping experiences with necessary suggestions and alternate choices. Whenever I purchase cosmetics I use Nykaa
great experience
"I was using this app for a long time it was good, but they are not helpful, as ordered few products and one of the item was missing I contacted them for the product or refund. They are unable to help me. Guys if this kind of thing happen with you guys, then just assume you have donated the money, because they won't help you. Anyways it was my last order from nykaa. Just sharing the Experience."
Very bad experience. I have not got my refund it is already 5 days. After i have cancelled my order
Disappointed. The customer support gives very slow response. First time using the app and i had a pretty bad experience. Didn't expect it from Nykaa.
wonderful experience n fast delivery thnk you nykaa
Experience was good but app was lil slow to open pictures products are good.but unfortunately our pincodes for kashmir are blocked its vry sad that we are not able to order the products directly to kashmir plz chk this.
A most wonderful and beautiful experience at the same time . Such a beautiful platform for a very beautiful woman like me .
Whata wrong with you guys ??? Why the hell you use such unproffesional and unproductive courier services ?? I made a PREPAID ORDER and i didnt recieve and the tracking id shows that its already delivered. What a horrible experience I am having. I¬† WANT¬† MY¬† PARCEL OR¬† PAY¬† BACK¬† MY MONEY¬† !!!!! Order¬†#500176684.  Provide me with ur customer care number I need to know whether you assure me my return. You guys DONT REPLY TO THE MAILS I HAVE BEEN SENDING REPEATEDLY
Its good app for shopping but it does not provide full information about their conditions and change it without any declaration.i m really disappointed with nykaa experience during this sale.They don't provide any return facility after product is delivered.Customer care response is really unbelievable they saying that its pandemic time so return is not possible.If u can't return your product back then plz provide information regarding return so customers can also avoid shopping from nykaa
Good experience with Nykaa üôÇ
"If there Is zero star rating.They deserve that only... Nykaa is a fraud shopping website. Plz don't buy any thing form this . They send different product and if you r going to return that.. They regularly harass you, even you co-oprate with them by sending photos and documents.. And at last they told that we send photos of different products.. So if you you have such type of experience share that.. Don't give fake ratings for influence costumer like me.. Go to the consumer court.."
Very good experience with nykaa. Bundle of beauty brands with proper delivery service and there packaging also good.
I have no any ideas coz it's my first experience with nykka
worst experience! I ordered from the pink sale.what hppend was they first took the order then cancelled after 48 hrs. then again I ordered the same products on the same day still today its going to be 48 hrs full. and till now it's not shipped such pathetic service nykaa! really disappointed in you. and the customer care u people keep is just useless let me name them ankush nair kunal pooja and what not.! they just keep saying it will be shipped . the hell its going to be shipped never ordering
very good experience with nykaa..love it
Very bad app worst experience with that. I ordered 5 time but not delivered my order. Recently my 3 order undelivered nd cancel by nyka. They never called. They never tried to deliver d customer I send msg even I called but they cut d call after hold. I gave my alternative number. Someone called from ecom nd told us for delivered nd d big thing he knew our house but not delivered order that was very bad nd personally it was very bad. I am totally disappointed with nyka app. I don't want to use
I am hating this new version n interface updatr.... Its not working at all... All applications in my phone working except this one..its soo slow you cannot think of browsing anything
I haven't received my order yet..and I hv already paid for my order nd still i m not receiving it..I haven't received any notification nor any call for delivery..im waiting for my order for last 6-7days..app is not good at tracking..experience is not good..plz dont install dis app..
always a good experience
nice experience to shop on Nykaa
"It's an amazing app with a huge variety of products on discounts from a huge variety of brands and as far as my experience has been, the products can be trusted pretty much, though once I was sent a baby lotion instead of a body wash that I ordered, hence four stars. Otherwise the app is really good."
The worst shopping experience ever. Order the item one months before and till now I didn't receive the order. There is no promer response from support. I won't recommend this app.
One serious suggestion. Only confirmed buyers should be allowed to leave reviews on products. Also please stop giving reward points to positive reviews. People need genuine honest opinions of others who have purchased the product and their experience with it. Otherwise its moot to have a review section at all
It was good experience üëç
"It's always been a great experience with nykaa. Have ordered shampoo, facewash, lotion multiple times."
Best experience ever!. I ordered few things from Nykaa but never received any faulty product like few other apps. Not even a single negative comment. If you are looking for your beauty related product than this app is best and offers are really good‚ò∫
amazing experience
"Amazing experience with nyka... You get free gifts, you can cancel order if any issue and also gives amazing discounts"
"Glad to be the oldest customer of Nykaa. Since the very first day they have never failed to give great products, timely delivery and good sales experience till today. Hope it stays the same in the future too."
So far I have a good experience with nykaa . Genuine products and timely delivery.
Always had awesome experience shopping from nykaa...thank u guys
Great experience
Just Love the App and also the experience and quality Nykaa gives with all the products and has exciting offers which makes you shop more.
Its was beautiful experience from Nykaa.....products actually very good
very bad experience.such a worst shopping app.order not delivered yet
Amazing experience
"User-friendly interface, wide variety of products, fast delivery"
"My first order with this site and it turned out to be a sour one! Ordered on 1st December it was taking so long to get delivered. When I mailed customer support they replied saying it'll be shipped soon. Then I get message saying that due to festive season thr is delay in delivery.. when I call them they say items have been shipped back as it's a non deliverable area. No update to me till I call them that my order has been cancelled, no refund of money yet. Very bad experience"
i love using this app ......an amazing experience with them .....the products are asm
good experience n huge discount get free nykaa
"Useless customer support worst app i ever seen if u order something u will get the product early ,in case if have any query about the delivered product, thats all they wont resolve it , very horrible service in refund case, am follow up the customer service üòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑthank you nykaa Pathetic experience"
User friendly app n authentic products ......was a nice experience shopping
My recent experiences with Nykaa were good.
"I ordered first time from nykaa app and first experience became worst experience, I ordered rimmel primer and nyx setting spray but they sent to me eyeshadow palette. Very disappointed, I ll never ordered again from this app ."
I order something my aunt order something with my phone number cause I receive order from delivery boy. but nykaa cancel my order cause we order from same phone number.why???????my order is cancel!! I will never buy from nykaa also my family and friends never buy from nykaa....very worst experience by by nykaa
WORST Used to love this app. Using it from months but now i hate this app. Don't buy from here. Specially Lip shades. Lip colour shown on d app r completely different from what u receive. N then they don't even listen to u. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER Hate it. Doesn't even deserve a single star.
Once again a very bad experience with this app.. Not even meet customer requirements.. I am searching for a product and when try to add to cart it says out of stock always out of stock... If you can't even maintain or update stock then why are you running such a bad app.. Are you fooling customers... Please don't install this app and don't waste your time... üò†üò†üò†üò†
Good experience
Great experience with Nykaa
I recently ordered products through nyka and had a really bad experience.They cancelled my order which I was waiting for a long time considering the delay in dekivery due to pandemic. But they even without attempting delivery they returned the products to their warehouse. I had a similar experience before also. Worst service by nyka online shopping app. Very much disappointed. I will never recommend nyka to anyone if they need the products urgently.
super experience...
"Previous version was gr8... totally disgusting don't use at all ...... 
always ur order delay and at the last movement cencled.... serious.. 
disgusting experience...."
Awesome experience by ordering the cosmetic products from Nykaa. Good app for cosmetic products for females...
Good experience
Great experience..
Awesome Experience With Nykaa
overall nice experience
Good experience!
"Updated review . Thanks for upgrading yourself .. Now I'll say it's the best beauty app ever at least in India.. Product selection , availability, delivery, offers everything us too good .. Overall really nice performance till date.. Only some issues if authenticity of high end products.. I still afraid of buying foreign brands from nykaa .. And the color shades you provide 8n lipsticks like Mac , Bobbi brown, smash box are not exact same nor even look a like except some popular shades .. I have all of them bought from store and when I match them in your shade card I just stunned .. no match actually.. However one has to watch the proper shades from YouTube then they'll buy.. Either else it's good .. Previous Review They delivers through the worst courier companies... I have got msg of delivering from the courier company named Tanvi on Saturday and today is Tuesday still I haven't received my orders. Mailed nykaa customer care they haven't took any steps not even replied me. Have already paid for the orders. Never had such a bad experience from any other online shopping sites. The worst shopping site is this nykaa. Will suggest everybody never ever use this site for shopping..."
good experience
Awsm app... Good experience...in love with the service‚ò∫‚ò∫keep it up! Team Nykaa‚úå‚úå
Such disappointments. Never really faced with other online purchases but here. Such a pathetic service. Wish to give half star if got the option to rate. Terrible customer experience; Nykaa is happy to collect money from a transaction but not to accept responsibility when things go wrong.
"World's worst app, becos of very very irritating ads, very bad experience too much ads I never seen app like this type of irritating ads dissapointed with nykka only becos of adsüò°"
"I used to like this app a lot. Have made purchases worth thousands of Rupees bu now. Also, I am a Prive member. One of the benefits of this membership is a free birthday gift in the birthday month. I got a sheet mask as a birthday gift which is hardly worth 50 Rupees. I am not at all happy with this experience. If i am doing so many purchases from this app, i should get atleast proper benefits."
Had a good experience.All the products are very genuine and good.
Its good experience but selected stuff mostly out of stock
Great experience so far.
"I have had an amazing experience with this app and its beauty products. If you are looking for varied products with in affordable price with authenticity (most Importantly) , Nykaa is the best option."
"Good experience so far. For some reason the redeem points option is not 
wrking. Sometimes that wont even show up on shopping cart page. Now that it 
ia showing up , i am not able to redeem it. While i am gling to check that 
box to redeem points it still remains unselected while the message pops up 
saying - point redeemed. Which actually is not happening. Please have a 
look at this issue"
nice experience
Just happy with my nyka experience....
Awesome experience with nykaa always ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Totally ridiculous experience...specially m disappointed with their delivery üôÑ
Excellent Experience!!
amazing experience....genuine products with good offers.what more? i m deeply and madly in love with nykaa....
my experiences is awesome with nykaa evertime...
"I never thought shopping wih Nyaka will be the worst experience. However guess what, it just happened. I order one product, money got deducted but the order didn' get placed and i haven't got my money back after waiting for 2-3 days. I get in touch with customer care and it is been 8 days I have been continuously calling them but no response, no results. They keep hanging up on my call in middle of. Customer care people are literally worst. They're not refunding my amount"
Worst experience. I ordered a nykaa mini lipstick. The quantity is way too less and the quality looks like of lip gloss. They're not accepting a return.
Not yet experienced
I recently download this app and my experience was good üòä
Great experience but u just need to work more on combo offers n discounts ....
Original product with 100% of affordable price. Its been a good experience for me. üòä
I always have a grt experience of this app...really loved this app....except only once i had an issue wid productn they didnot respond otherwise its a grt app fr women üòç
Good experience üëç
Nice experience
Awesome experience... Not only once...but alwaz
best app nykaa amazing experience.i love it..
"EXCELLENT. I have been ordering stuff from Nykaa for over two months now, and I have to say my experience is way different from the negative reviews written below. My products are always delivered within 2-5 days, properly covered and wrapped, and received in excellent condition no matter what the item is. Thumbs up to the fast delivery as my recent purchase of about 9 items took just two days to reach me. For Korean beauty lovers, Innisfreee and The Face Shop products are available at affordable prices, and a lot of other branda have discounts that can't keep you away from ordering them."
I was very happy with this app and I used to order products from this app very often. But I found out they are selling fake products with combo offers. I tried taking this problem to the Nykaa team but they just denied the fact. Just to earn some money they started selling fake and cheap products. Too much disappointed by their reaction. Nykaa is no more a trusted app now. They just say that the product is 100% authentic and sell away fake products. Had a very bad experience.
Good Experience
Good experience
Wonderful experience with nykaa... Never disappointed with any of my orders üëç...
Very very bad experience. Not able return the products only if the product we want to changeüò°üò°. I have deleted this app this so bad that we can't cancel or return the product. Amazon is the best app ever
"It is an amazing experience of shopping from nykaa. Fast delivery, original products and heavy discounts are the highlighting features of this app. It really induces us to make more purchases from nykaa only."
Good experience
"Don't download. Substandard products. Don't place prepaid orders, you will surely lose your money and get nothing in return. Not even refund. The worst app. Worst products. Worst experience. Don't buy from here"
My experience is amazing with nykaa nd products are vry good packing etc unbelievable designs iam vry happy to purchase from this app
M a very regular customer of nykaa. but last two experiences were horrible.
I hv ordered the items till date for only 3 times...but yess experience was sooo gud...luv the nyka for cosmetics..üòòüòòüòò

Going to have my first experience in Nyka but the products are good for sure. Thanks Nyka

Very good experience
Nice experience
Always amazing experience and products.
Products are super good. Good service. Nyce experience. Fast delivery.
But to experience
Good experience comfortable with nykaa and nykaa fashion too
"app is useful,but the courier company very very very worst.why nyka is dealing with such stupid company.i booked some products from nyka,but it is divided into 3 shipments,2 are with same courier which is delivered in right time,but 3 rd one is not delivered,its almost one week.till now i didnt get the products.worst experience"
good experience
i have the best online shopping experience ever
"Different customer care executives say things which are contrary to one another, they have wasted so much of time and still only apologies and they have failed to stand on their own words. I took everything into records,the response is very slow. I am not making purchases anymore from this Platform. 7 days back a return request was filed ,an account number and all the necessary details were shared. It was assured that 3 days after I will be reverted with the status on the same. I reached out to them when I received no response they assured for the refund of 72 hours which I took into records till now no action and the customer care on the chat is asking for more time to investigate. They discredit their own brand by contradicting one another. On being asked they take lot of time and come back with apologies and no thorough answer, how long can people devote their time into this ? Really Bad experience. On being asked what should I expect now, they end the chat"
Very good experience and they give amazing product
Worst delivery experience ever. And the nykaa team had no concern for that. They sends sms that your product will be delivered within 24 hr. But it will may take a year.
Good experience
Good experience with Nykaa
Excellent interface and beautiful products
Worst experience. I ordered my product before 15days. I m still waiting for my product. Submitted multiple tickets. No response. Nothing is done. Let this be my last order with nykaa... So much disappointed with Nykaa service
worst experience and worst product my lipstick was literally water and open this is second time if you want original product dont buy from naykaa
"The app seems to care only about disposing of its products, neither do they care about the product and not at all about customer experience... simply asking customers to get in touch with the brand themselves for any after sales support. Highly disappointing on the part of an international brand to behave with such insensitivity upon customer requests"
Great experience
Great experience. ..must try...
good experience
Awesome experience..the discounts are great
Great Service and Experience
"Terrible experience, awful packaging, Delievers damaged product, no way to reach out customer service. Still trying to replace the damaged product."
It's a wonderful experience to make me more beautiful
Very good experience so far
awesome experience
Bahut hi bekar application hai..isme 300 ke niche shopping kar hi nii sakta h koi..very bad experience
wonderful experience!
Excellent .Wonderful experience.
Such a cheap n all products are also cheap I ordered kaya products from nykaa I got so many allergies on my face..customer support is very disappointing n didn't get response on time..very bad experience with this app.
my experience is very excellent. proper stasifaction for product for delivery.
A very bad experience with this app Retrun policy is very bad
Jus wow first time i have shopped and i must say its an owsm experience packaging was very good nd delivered within tym from now i ll purchase all my cosmetics from nykka only you deserve starüòäüòò
very good experience with nyaka I love to buy things from nyaka.best brand and received all things in good condition too
Amazing experience and genuine products. Nykaa never fails to provide that delight factor in my purchase.
Awesome experience shopping at nykaa
perfect experience
It really feels amazing to use this App...Instead of visiting diffrent store's you can get all different variety of costmestic Brands at one place only and could place order easily and get things delivered to your house..It is really a good experience with nykaa üòä‚ù§
good experience
This app is super easy to use. Had a wonderful shopping experience.
I have been using this app for my regular shopping since 7 years now. But recently i have been defrauded by a group of people on the name of Nykaas promotional event. They gave me my own order history details from nykaa (order time and date and the amount of that order) which made me believe they are actually from nykaa. I want to know what kind of privacy is nykaa following and who will be held accountable for the fraud i and other people like me have experienced.
Worst experience with nykaa I have placed order on 24th jul20and its should be reached to me by 29thjul20 and i have ot received my order till 1st August and now its showing that your order is returned I talked to wow express they say that nykaa requested us to return your order to them What the hell is going on I talked to nykaa customer care they say sir place new order this order cant be delivered to you . I have placed this order in nykaa hot pink sale how can now i get those offers back
good experience only problem is delivery of minimum 500 otherwise nice service
Always the best. Thank you Nykaa for a great experience always ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
Easy to navigate between options on the application! A great first time ordering experience!
Great experience from this app.
Good experience
Good products and great offers! Love the experience.
Very good experience
Nice experience
"Amazing experience, all products are good and easily available"

Bad experience in order lingerie
Hassle free experience

Worst experience ever. I've ordered some stuff on sale and reaceived wrong products and even after returning everything got only half of the money.
Loved the experience
Good experience Shopping with nykaa ..... genuine and best products by Nykaa.....
I am having awesome experience with nykaa. love itüòç‚ù§üëåüëå
Better offers than some apps. Navigating through the app can be a pain sometimes. But overall a satisfying experience
superlative user experience
Excellent experience üòç
Delivery is late buttt my products that i order are great and in good condition ....I do ist tym shopping on nykaa ....my experience is great ......thanku u nykaaüòä
Great experience...
it was really awesome experience with nykaa....as products r genuine.....they ship the items with care......good offers.....I really really luv itüòç‚ù§
Initially everything was fine. But in my last experience. Nykaa is not returning my money. The order was placed but it was not confirmed and my money got deducted. Tried customer care. They werent of any help. Highly disappointed.
pathetic experience .. they send either used products or expired products. even after complaints never got the product pick up nor got my money back. dont shop from here
Amazing experience shopping on nykaa just love this app‚úåüèªüíó
Good experience
experience is good but its quite costly and do not provide much coupons
"worst experience with Nykaa. They give only one delivery perfect. After that they do very irresponsible job. Sometimes they couldn't find your address, bla bla bla, useless excuses they had. Don't use this app."
Very good user experience
Amazing experience
When i first installed this site i bought many items and fortunately it was all gud.. After some gap i reinstalled this app recently and purchased beauty products for almost 800 rs and i got a defective seal broked maybelline cream of rs.235 and that day itself i have applied for a replacement.. But no reply even after a month.. Very bad and irresponsible customer care and i never expected such an experience from Nykaa.. gudbye to nykaa..
Great Experience
Recently had a very bad experience! Th courier people never delivered the package showing its failed delivery when they didn't even try delivering and the customer service of Nykaa couldn't do anything about it. I had to wait for over a week calling the customer service each day and they asked me to wait wait and wait! Finally I cancelled the product sending mails to both Nykaa and the courier company. Such a disappointment from Nykaa. Atleast I got the refund within a few days. Thanks for that!
Great shopping experience with good discount
I totally love this app. The products that has been delivered by it are totally genuine. I have been using it for past 6 months and my experience have been wonderful. I requested for an early delivery and so they did. It is perfect as every day some sale is going on or there are combo packs which are cheap. I would totally recommend this app
"Hey! First time shopped from this app... No doubt, products and offers are good... Bt had worst experience in delivery... Too much late..."
"My first experience here in this app has been amazing. Received my packages within a week even during this time of pandemic. From now on, I'm only going to shop from here. Kudos to the whole Nykaa Team!! May you all stay safe and keep up with the great services."
fast and good experience but they should change delivery service from Bluedart to some other good and fast delivery service
Very good experience
Wonderful Experience .Love u Nykaa
worst app..worst service provided..worst talking with the customer care executives who throws tantrums instead of apologising fr the inconvenience causd to the customers...twice i placed ordered and it didnt reach me..on callng the customer care they said we cnt give u any certainty whtr it wl reach or not...if u ppl cnt provide good service to ur customers then y making false commitments ... worst experience
I hate the service.. I returned one product and it's more than a month... till now didn't receive my refund amount.. completely disgusting experience
good experience
nice experience from nykaa.. products on time with good quality..
super fast delivery..and genuine products Overall great experience i would say..!!
A very good experience and the products are amazing right there. really enjoyed ordering ü§óü§ó
Pls improve share experience on your app. When u share a nykaa product on whatsapp etc.. the link opens the nykaa app home page and not the product.. tried both on app and website
"Great shopping experience they send good quality products, great discounts, packaging is very nice overall good experience thank yo nyka"
"Overall experience is good. I received all my product on time. But if u could improve the return or exchange facilities more better, then it will be awesome."
"Excellent app üëè Received fresh products which is fantastic as my biggest fear while shopping online is receiving products which are close to their expiry date üôÑ But why do they take so much time to ship the products, We've been spoiled by fast delivery and smooth experience from shopping apps like flipkart and Amazon so it's not easy waiting so long for the products to reach us."
Good experience
good experience
ultimate destination to shop for authentic good quality beauty products .. great experience everytime
Worst experience ever on online shopping!! They neither deliver on time nor give u refund!!!. Deleted the app as well
Worst experience ever.. I didn't receive any order but I got Msg that the product is delivered.
"Horrible experience. Selling wrong/fake products. Showing something, selling something different. When I requested to replace the product that they delivered, they were not accepting the request. I had given them the product image, invoice image but there was no response. This app wasted my previous time and money. Don't buy anything from here. I've sent mail. This app is saying they sent me right product but this is wrong product."
nice experience overall
"Do not spend ur money on this app.. it show u somthing n deliver you 
somthin else n when u complained about it they said u check that product we 
cannot take it back..worst experience ever.. never gonna suggest this app 
to anyone in future."
Horrible customer service experience. Customer care dont even understand problem or escalate the issue to bring solution to customer. Not at all advisable to spend money on this app... wrong sizes written even on size board . Then they repeatedly write no return accepted like 10 times instead to understanding the issue
Good experience
It was nice experience
just loved the Nykaa experience and shared it with couple of my friends too....but some of the Biotique products were differently priced.... overall am happy....quick delivery too adds to the joy :-)
Awesome experience
"It was a bad experience .. It was my first order from nyka.and m so 
disappoint.. I purchased a straightner which was damaged. On contacting 
them they refused and said that we are not manufacturers of the product not 
the retailers.. Contact the retailers. It was so disappointed that they 
sell products of such brands that give away damaged products.. And morever 
all i have to do is all myself..they didnt gave any contact details of the 
brand.. The product is still lying with me.. In the damaged condition.. I 
hv lost hope for return."
nice experience
My experience with nykaa has always been amazing.Such a quick delivery and you dont have to worry about the genuieness of the product as its the most trust worthy site to order your bunch of skin care makeup and many more thingsüòöüòä
I loved this app. products are genuine and I have not received a damaged product till now. Overall very good experience.

great experience
such q bad service don't accept returns at all had very bad experience I bought two lipsticks and when it got delivered I tested it once and the shades were like artificial I placed a return but they refused it .
Very worst experience.. i have not got my refund after raising so many times request. After completing also again and again they are asking about our problems and they are not resolving it. M not understanding here how many times i have to write the same thing to explain them.
good experience. 3 days delivry maximum.
"This was my 1st order from the site, excitedly i opened my box only to find out that out of the 3 products ordered only 1 product was there inside. Paid the full amount only to get cheated. Never had such awful online shopping experience. Sent an email. Don't know if i would ever get the products or else the money back. This site is looting the hard earned money of the people in this manner. After my 1st complaint, I had been provided great service and valued products! Thanks!!"
Great experience
Awesome experience while shopping with nykaa really love the quality of products and offers which they gave time to time Also the variety of cosmetics and so many brands. I think it's the best cosmetics shopping app I am a regular customer of it And I really love shopping with Nykaaüëç Nykaa keep it up with this good job also with the variety of range of cosmetics I personally very much like Nykaa and the products which they give us Truly a happy customers I am while shopping with nykaaaaaaaaa
"The delivery partner they have is isolent ,they just deliver only where they feel the ride would be comfortable ..they are playing with my orders for almost 2 weeks now and the nyaka helpline is trying to coverup .always go with cash on delivery or else these guys will play with you. Very dissapointed.i have lost my expectation and excitement both of recieving the order .every day i get 2 msges saying ""out for delivery ""but nothing happens what the msg says. worst experience .pathetic service."
great experience
Great experience...
"Recieved a expired product. very wrost. delivery is very very worst. Recent experience ordered a product on 5th july 2019 received it on 9th july, but product manufacturing date was December 2018. very worst almost 7months got over in the expiry days."
Nice experience for me
Nykaa's notifications and delivery is good but once I received a shampoo which was poorly packed so that one experience didn't went well but others were good.
Good experience
Amazing experience. Abundance of products from all good brands coupled with Nykaa Offers. My order came the very next day. Love Nykaa Absolutely!
worse experience with the 1st order in nykaa
Superb app... Great shopping experience..

Gr8 experience with nykka
Best shopping experience Original product
Good experience and fast delivery with original product with reasonable price üëå
Wonderful experienceüíñü§ó
gud experience
i tried nyka for the second time and it was a horrible experience this time. I ordered for an eyeliner and a lipstick and i did the prepaid payment for the same. The order was also placed and confirmed but suddenly i get a message after its shipment that the products cant get delivered to me. Now i am trying to raise this issue on their app as directed by them but the page just isn't loading or nothing is happening after clicking on the raise concern button.
"very bad experience with Nykaa. They keep showing out of stock items with the caption ""just 2 left"" and the item will not get dispatched after weeks. The support keeps on ensuring that it will be dispatched soon and keeps you waiting by the end of which, they cancel the item from their end and apologize with the cliche dialogue "" sorry for the inconveniences"" . The money get refunded after weeks. Use this app only if you have immense patience and time only to get it never delivered."
Seamless experience. Better offer than amazon and flipkart. Loved it.
"Its a great experience shopping on Nykaa... All brands are available, even luxury brands which used to be available only in US/UK.. Great discounts too.. And returns are easy... All in all a great shopping experience online.. 10 üåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåü"
"The coupon invalid issue needs to be informed first up i.e. once items are added to bag,it should not show that coupon for me,if it is not applicable for me.This is the first time I had such a horrible experience during online shopping. It is really bad that after order was placed successfully, then it is getting cancelled and the reason for that is the fault of your app basically the coding part of your app is at fault.Update your app and please don't waste others time like you wasted mine."
i hve an excellent experience wd nykaa as always..i had done my all marriage shopping thru nykaa..thnku nykaa
Osam experience to shopping with nykaa.. I love this app.
Loved my experience with Nykaa!

"Nyka is one of the best online shopping apps for cosmetics..I never ever had a bad experience in the product quality, this is a one stop destination for all the beauty products"
"bad experience , i didn't receive my product yet"
very good experience
"i loved this app initially.super fast delivery,great discounts,but that was just for little time.it's becoming worse day by day.poor customer service.none of the team members are available at any time of the day in chat now.poor packaging,didn't refund even after so many complaints.very bad experience. didn't expected this.reviewed so many bought products yet no reward points.i regret using this app now.lost my trustüëé"
"The worst app i have ever experienced. Customer care are not at all helpful. I have contacted the customer care 5 times atleast for the return request, the tickets were raised . I have raised the issue and send the pictures of the delivered products many times but no action has been taken. I still not received any pickup from their end nor any refund. I suggest not to use this app as it doesn't support and resolve any of the queries. Really very disappointed üëé"
As always gr8 experience...heavy discount wid gud quality products..love it

I have ordered very first time from nykaa...mini liquid matte lipstick but received dry product. I have raised return request but not received any revert..also not able to contact on given no. in help center tab..also send mail on their mail id but not found any support from them. My first shoping experience from nykaa is very bad.. will never recommande this to any one
Very nice experience..got free products as well as good discount on billing...
Genuine quality products are available with the best deals. Nykaa delivers orders faster than any other beauty shopping app without damaging any of the products. Just loved the experience. More support to the NYKAA Team.
Very poor experience shopping with this app. unsatisfactory product..be careful buying costly product as they send old and dingy packaged products...
Very bad experience with nykaa.. The return policy is worst....
Great experience üòÉüòÉ

Good experience so far but m forced to reduce 2 starts though i want to remove more coz of the ads. It has become impossible to use the phone coz no matter what i do the ads keep ppping on the main screen even while using other app or anything. Plz don't force me to delete nykaa do something!
Good experience

And product not replaced.. tried to connect for two days with naykaa shared my problem but no solution given.. I have been s regular customer.. but this is the service i recieved.
Excellent experience.
great experience. delivery on time
Exilent experience with nykaa.
The number 1shopping app I must say.. Nykaa always keep a particular standard when it comes to packaging and delivering. Their customer service is also good. U will get an experience of buying from a branded store
very gud experience
My experience was so bad with nyka... I got damaged product and nyka refused to return back it bcos of lockdown... If u cant return it so why u delivered it to me???... I lost my money by shopping with nyka They send me very cheap and very bad product... And also their service is so bad... They cant help us with properly... I am going to uninstall it and I'll never buy anything from nyka.. And tell others about it... I am vey disappointed
One of the most comprehensive set of products and the process is seamless. Great shopping experience
It's a wonderful experience while shopping in nykaa
Lovely app.Good easy shopping experience. Pretty good discounts.
good experience
"Amazing experience to shop here.All brands n products are upto mark,i love Nykaa!!"
I am just loving shopping here.... Cant resist the deals and the product are awesome... Delivery is quick and free.... Thanx nykaa... for the wonderful experience i had while shopping..
I have placed my order on 31st feb and my order is not even dispatched yet. They are not even replying for my queries. Today is 8th feb and services are very slow. I will not buy any product from this site from now on. No site takes 10 days to dispatch the product. Very bad experience
"For the first time, bad experience with Nykaa. I placed and order for black maskara but automatically they placed an order for blue maskara and when I received the product today....I got to know its blue maskara which I didn't order."
"bad experience i have, i never use this app and nyka site again"
I had an awesome experience while shopping with nykaa...it has all the beauty products i need and its easy to use
Very good experience
need more international drugstore brands at low prices. also there are many products that are always out of stock and this is a deal breaker for me. the app interface is good.
Nice experience
It's very nice experience....
nykaa fashion experience is good but beauty experiences are way too poor... beauty products are really very fake..... :(
awesome experience.....
"I have not received my order but tracker shows that it has been delivered. 
Spoken to your customer care executive but they had laidback approach . 
Worst experience with you guys. Either you deliver the product or refund 
the amount"
"This is an amazing platform to buy all your routine cosmetics, also jewelleries. Good and fast UI; my experience has been great so far. However, products are over packaged than it needed to be. A simple bag would suffice (thinking environmentally)."
Nice experience
Great Experience
Without knowing me you returned my order.. Worst experience...
Very satisfying experience from nykaa
"Best app, very good and easy to use .. product quality is very good, cosmetics are original . Package and delivery services is very good and delivered the products on time.. my overall experience is good about this app . All branded cosmetics are original and in good condition ..is you have any problem customer service is available and they revert you as soon as possible. Nykaa's own products are also very good .I like nykaa lipsticks and nailpolish . This app is easy to use and easy to handl"
very good experience
good experience
"Good experience, thank you"
Good experience always with nyakaa
Fabulous experience.. great
It has been a wonderful experience shopping from Nykaa and will be continuing.
"I had the worst  shopping experience on this app. I had placed my order almost a month back and still have not received it. When I wrote an email regarding my problem, they ensured me that it will be solved soon. However, even after writing them thrice,there is still no progression in my order. And everytime I ask about my refund they tell me my order will be delivered in some days. Their services are pathetic. And customer care never solves your problem. I wish I could rate them in negative."
Nykaa has really disappointed me. The worst delivery service i have ever received in all the years of my online shopping. Delivering the product takes a Lifetime. The delivery guys never calls and just postpones the delivery as per his will. Pathetic experience with this app. The customer services always request for 24-48 hours for resolving the issue which again takes an era to get resolved.Demanded a refund bcoz 2 of my products haven't reached even after 9 days of placing an order.Disappointed
"till now i had a very good experience, the products were really very effective. thanks a lot. but only one disadvantage sometimes delivery gets delayed rest all is just more than perfect."
Tis app brings me best make up and personal skincare products with wonderful discounts with unique experience in make up range and delivery commit on time
"I have been a loyal customer. But with my last order, i have been disappointed. This is the worst experience ever. Giving false hope to your customers is the worst thing ever. Nykaa showed me offer regarding the face shop toner. And i fell prey into it and ordered it. Only to know that my order will be cancelled with absolute no reasons and the offer doesn't stand at all. You are going to lose your customers if you continue this act. These customers love you, the least you can do is not give them false hopes. This is  disappointing and disgusting."
One of the best online shopping app I have experienced till date ‚ò∫Ô∏è
My experience is wowww
Awesome experience
"The customer care is the absolute worst. Worst experience ever. Their customer service doesn't even respond to the customers. Buy whatever you want from Amazon, people."
Great experience
superb experience!
Good experience....! I love nykaa alot but i have issue regarding i got one defective product which i got free.
Superb experience :)
Absolutely love the experience of shopping at Nykaa.. it's my one stop destination for all makeup needs. The received products are genuine and packed with utmost care and the delivery is super fast! Thank you Nykaa!
Very bad experience
Easy to use interface. Great variety of products. Always original and reasonably discounted. Definitely recommend this app
Worst experience of delivery... Never expected this from nykaa.
Its always been a wonderful experience on Nykaa from..the time of ordering to the delivery and the products delivered too r very good.
I've been buying things from the app for over 2 years now . this is the 1st ever bad experience I've here had . I ordered for 2 matte me liquid lipstick and I recived fake product . The very moment I opened the parcel I sent a mail to the customer service with the picturs and also called and informed them about my concern. now it's been 2 weeks I've been calling them for 2 weeks now they are not refunding my money . neither are they resolving my problem I'm so disappointed.
Very good shopping experience with Nykaa I'm very happy üòä
naykaa always gives good discounts on products.. and products are genuine as of my experience..
Very good experience
Loving the experience‚ò∫Ô∏èüòä
bad experience!!!
Amazing experience with nykaa.. it delivers so fast and safely. One of the best site to order the luxury products as well.
great experience...
Always a pleasurable experience
good experience ‚ò∫ü§ó
Flawless Experience
great experience nice service
I ordered some products from this pathetic app on 10th of April then on 14th i got a notification that the order got failed to deliver.. no one called me or showed up.. i escalated the same thing for 7 days and continuously it was getting failed courier guy didn't even tried for delivery.. it was a prepaid order.. didn't got any confirmation when i will be getting my refund.. CSR are worst they dont help u instead irritate u by saying have patience..and still wting for refund.. worst experience..
"Great experience. all the products are genuine. Go for it without any doubt. Discount on things, delivery on time, good customer service. A big thumbs up üëç"
Very convenient. Excellent delivery experience. Wide range of products and multitude of brands to choose from. Love the offers and discounts as well! Love the shopping experience.
According to my experience this the best app at all
nice and awesome experience
Amazing experience with all nykaa products
wonderful experience
"I ordered a lipstick from nykaa, 2 times I got product that was going to expire soon. After writing nykaa n no. Of times you didnt get the expected product. Very bad customer service. Bad experience"
super experience with nykaa... i just love it...
"I am having the worst experience with this app. The products received are damaged and their return policy is so tedious and time taking that it feels like torture. Their team doesnot reply to mails and all they do is linger on the return approval. It has been more than 3 days since I applied for refund but no progress yet. I suggest to go for other sites like purple, amazon and mynta."
Good experience
Worst experience with nykaa. Had ordered products which was suppose to be delivered btw 6-9. I haven't recieved the product even now(11). The support team says it ll be delivered today n tat today is not coming. Delivery partner(shadowfax) contact number is invalid. I asked them to escalate.neither they r solving the issue nor sending my order.
Worst experience with Nykaa. I have ordered the items twice but they have not delivered the productss to me twice. Each time I order items it shows that they have failed to deliver the items at the time of delivery. But they did not give me any valid reason for it. I never expected this from my Nykaa.
great experience
awsome experience
"I am a regular customer of Nykka but recently I have had the worst experience while shopping from Nykaa, it was a prepaid order (as they a not supporting COD now a days) and around 2.5k bucks was paid. Oneday I recieved a message stating that your order has been delivered while it wasn't. They showed me a proof of delivery conataining a signature of the recipient . The signature was neither mine nor of anyone from my family. Didn't expect this from Nykaa."

"#original_products, amazing experience..luv to shop from nykaa"
"Excellent range of products, nice offers ....overall a good experience"
Nyka is a good company but I've been trying to apply here to work I've sent my cv to the HR but they simply don't reply idk why? its heart wrenching when you want to work somewhere and you have experience but the company just doesn't want to have a look and atleast give you a chance.
Awesome experience!
"Good experience with Nykka they always reach the expectations, on time delivery, original product also with good packaging üëç"
It's an amazing experience to shop from nykaaa

The best beauty shopping app I've experienced ever!
good experience
"Amazing interface, categorisation and browsing ease. Gets you hooked!"
"I got half of my order n was charged fully. Customer services are so poor that even after 3 mails, no one has replied or called back!  If I could I would not even give 1 star. This is just plain theft of my order, m so pissed. Never ordering again from nykaa. Better if you buy right from the store, at least you get what you pay for. BAD EXPERIENCE NYKAA!"
Wonderful experience üëç
My experience while shopping on nayka is awesome
"As I write this review I feel really bad because Nykaa has been one of my favourite cosmetics sites. Lately I've had a very ugly experience while shopping from here. Two of my orders were delayed and not even delivered. The courier partner 'Bluedart' has been of no use. They didn't contact me even though my order was with them which led to my order being cancelled. Also, the helping center has not been any helpful. It's time Team Nykaa took note of this and did something."
my experience was too good... I love the app.. üíìüíì
I am a regular customer. Lovely experience with Nykaa.
Awesome App. Awesome Products and Awesome and ever fastest delivery experience. The Best App for your healthy skin üíï‚ô•Ô∏èüéÅü•≥

Good experience I m sorted for all what I need
I have got broken hair brush . Bad experience
My nykaa app is not working i hv to uninstall and install it 100 times very bad experience
Very user friendly interface!!
Effortless experience
Horrible experience!I have loved nykaa for so long that it is really devastating to say this that they very much lack in customer service. I know that they are still are a small company and can't offer good customer base but this is no way to treat people when they spend lacks on their stupid app! I had ordered multiple items but one of the package is showing delivered but I have not received it. This is after a month and still no contact on refund or package delivered.Don't buy from them!!!!!
Good experience üëç
Good experience...
Good experience so far.. Hope for the same in future as well.
Good shopping experience
Amazing experience while shopping through Nykaa ü§ó
Very nice experience
"My experience with nykaa was good since past few months ..i constantly use this app and i have ordered so much from this app ...whenever u recieve anything damaged they r never there to help u ...but this is the second time i recieved a damaged product and they say that they cannot proceed the return request ,they fool us and use us ..the product cost me rs. 600 ...they cheat on their costomers ...they did this before also..but i thought its ok...but guys pllzzz dont use this application .."
"Just Loved Shopping here! Great app, easy to find the required things. filters, suggestions, really helped me choose best products. Nice experience."
Always great experience. Nyka serves and delivers the best
"Worst experience. I place order on monday(2 dec) and expected delivery date was friday(6 dec), and today(5 dec) it shows that delivery is failed due to wrong address. The same issue was occurred during my last order. Then I entered the same address that I had entered before, then my order was delivered. Plz nykaa if you can't delivered on the date that you give then don't give the false expected date. I need that product on tomorrow. And now it will delivere after 2-3 days. I'm very dissapointed"
good experience.....
wonderful shopping experience
I have been shopping through Nykaa quite a few times but the last time was a bad experience. I received a defective product and they failed to give me a refund as I wasn't in India to return the product. I took pictures and send it to them but still they were unwilling to process my refund. Very unhappy with their service.
"Very very bad customer support and don't responsibility for your email 
inquiry's and don't action your all feedbacks and also they have 
unprofessional customer support agent's. Totally worst experience"
"I ordered using a gift card one week back, and the order is not even shipped yet. No responses from the support team. Terrible experience and wasted Rs 2,000 at Nykaa."
I always had a good experience with my Nykaa...i do stay in a small town but deliver is always perfect...and i never had any complains regarding anything... Thank you
The experience with Nyakaa is really worth value.
"Worst Experience from Nykaa.. please never place order ever which is not 
prepaid. Very careless service. 2 months has been passed but still I didn't 
receive my products. Very disappointed."
Good experience
Having a great experience with nykaa
"great offer, fast delivery & huge collection of products. overall an awesome experience."
My experience with Nykaa is really good till date. No complain.

Trustworthy and super experience.
"My shopping experience with nykaa remain awesome they provide fast delivery, wide range of products with nice discount and top of that suprise gifts üòä thank you nykaa"
My past experience was good
"Had a very disappointing and distasteful experience with nykaa , I have ordered 3-4 times before and never faced such an issue but this time when a shipment was sent without any prior notice hence was unable to receive it ,I was a little surprised.waites two days and even called at the designated number and no reply , come Monday I sent an email which is being looked into and now it's Friday no constructive reply  just false assurance, I called 3 and was assured that the product would be delivered today hence cancelled prior obligation and it wasn't despite me asking repeatedly , NO credibility in the word.called again and said it would be delivered in 48 hours or tomorrow if logistics team are working how can u not know if they working or not. unfortunately had to resort to a harsher tone due to the unprofessional attitude and cancel the order and don't think would be ordering again."
Services are not good. Bad experience.
great experience
Awesome products.. Great experience I am loving it ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
It was great experience
"A perfect shopping experience with almost all the variety in the market. And yes, Nykaa Men is something we men are loving! üòä"
good experience
Huge discounts and so much variety. My first purchasing experience has been very satisfying
Very bad experience each time I ordered from Nykaa.. customer service is very disappointing.. they'll not share the delivery partner's details or contact no and they'll just cancel your order if you're unable to receive it at a particular time..also there is no provision of expected date of delivery..
Good Experience
Wonderful experience
Awesome experience I don't think dat there is any other app like nykaa... Products r original nd found in low price in comparison to other app ND near by market

I had a very bad experience with my last 2 orders. One of them is still not delivered even after 15 days of ordering and I've called their executives but nobody helped and eventually I had to cancel my order as I got tired of calling them every day. Not gonna shop again after this horrible experience. M doubtful if i will ever get my refund or not.

it's a great app.. Everytime i get real products and i loved the experience of shopping here
I ordered deep black eyeconic Kajal of lakme from nykaa. I got it in broken condition. worst experience.
"Amazing experience, original products,great deal love the app"
Worst customer service. I've been waiting for my shipment for a week and still didn't receive my package. Inspite of me following up with Nykaa customer service there was no response or ownership about the delayed shipment. Worst experience... Disappointed!!!!
This is one of the most trustable store . They never sell a fake or date failed product .love the experience .happy and satisfied always üòäüòä.
Awesum experience
very nice experience with nyka
very bad experience with Nykaa..
Had an very good experience with Nyka...Delivery within 38 hours tht I loved the most...Thank you Nyka üòä
"Ordered for the first time.. recieved a damaged product.. had an horrible 
experience.. tried to file a complaimt for return through their app and it 
doesnt even work everytime it gets cancelled and i cant even file for a 
return.. pathetic service and pathetic support.. better to order stuff from 
other companies like myntra or flipkart .. atleast u will be able to return 
if u get a damaged product.. Just check the reviews of nykaa every single 
review is one star.. they are least bothered about the customers. Update - 
3rd july.. i returned the damged product 15 days ago and i still havent got 
my refund.. pathetic horrible service by nykaa..really frustrated with the 
way they treat thwir customers.. Update 13 july.. customer care is saying 
they have refunded the amount on 19th june.. and in my bank statement it 
doesn show anywherr.. horrible service just full of liars and asked me to 
email the statement.. and in emails they can just avoid the 
customer..highly regret buying stuff from them ..dont expect any support 
from nykaa u r doomed if u receive a damaged product.."
Nykaa !!! A great app to get all the products at your door step. The overall experience of the app is pretty amazing to me as it displays the detailed product description. The products are generally delivered within 2-3 days of ordering. Thanks Nykaa for building such an app.
Good experience
Rich experience
It's been a great e shopping experience with Nykaa!!

Worst experience to shop with nykaa.. Just a waste of money and time to shop with you. I have placed my order for lakme absolute foundation and the product was not have that original texture. It was truly a fake product. Their is question of their originality Pathetic app Won't recommend anyone
Worst ever experience What they promise they dont fulfill Deliver empty boxes and promise free gift which never come Feel cheated Highly dissappointed
Awesome experience able to know about more beauty products
I had a good experience with nykaa.good offers and genuine products
Lovely experience
good experience üëçüëçall items are good
Everything is fine about this app but the courrier with which they have tied up is pathetic that delivery man keeps asking us for inspite of paid order. He always asks us for money as he thinks we should give him some. Never had such kind of experience with other online shopping delivery persons. it really ruins our think i always think about never making any further order from this app. M really unhappy with this issue.
Wonderful experience
It's a nice experience of shopping on Nykaa... All the brands of cosmetics on Nykaa are good....
NICE EXPERIENCE
"I love this app, as i get original products at great discount. also the interface is user friendly i can easily search the product and place the order."

Very bad experience with team nykka...ise 1 kya 0 rating star milna chahaiye...jo dikhta h wo milta nhi aur return ya exchange jaisi chiz bhi nhi h...i will never suggest this app to anyone and going to uninstall it right now....bkwas app and its serving is ughh....these are very unresponsive to their customer....i have very bad experience with nykaa.. wil never buy anything else now..i have requested too much for return but these are highly computerised and never listen to their customer

Its a Amazing app without many offers and combos...There is a wide range of products apart from Nykaa Products....Some companies are a bit over rated. Rest its a good experienceüòä‚úå
"Hated the experience,ordered a straightner which was defective but they 
refused to replace it saying it is a personal hygiene product and they 
cannot replace it.acc to which everything on there app is 
unreplaceable.hate u ppl"

Really bad experience.... They just don't provide u option to cancel ur orders.. It takes too long to deliver order..... It's almost 25 days but I have not received my order yet.... üò°üò†üò£
good experience
Loved the product range and the discounts offered...my only concern was that Nykaa own products are priced a little high without any discounts...overall a good experience. Thanks Nykaa
Very bad experience for nykaa services. I'm not happy to your services. The processing is too late. I'm suffering 5 days of your services my order not delivered . I contact the customer care still not delivered. Special Karnal excomexpress nykaa center . Very very bad services by delivery boy.
"I am using Nyka quite frequently now, and the experience of products and its delivery is quite excellent. The quality of products are worth the price and am happy for their fast delivery. I must say Nyka has saved time by providing products so easily and appropriately on time. I am happy using this app. Keep up the good work ! Bravo!"
Good experience. Must try this app
I am a regular customer of Nykaa and I had pretty good experience with this app. I would definitely recommend this app to buy make up products.
Good Experience
Nice experience with nykaaa.. products packing is up to the mark..fast delivery..üòä
Very bad experience & damage product delivered
"Amazing app, experienced genuine products + huge discounts + packaging.. 5 star"
Ultimate experience!!
"Too expensive and Nykaa sells adulterated, false Products. Please be aware of them. This kind of products will harm your skin. I have experience the same thing hence I am making you people aware about the same"
"Nykaa used to be my favourite,now they r cheating people,they r showing wrong mrp and on name of discount percent they r taking more than mrp.plzz guyss b alert check mrp first on google .I have experience on many products as such on vaadi moiturizer,tide powder and many more.check on their app and tally with real mrps."
Wonderful experience
"Worst shopping experience ,..ordered a product 3-4 days  but not  shipped till now"
Very good user interface and a very good application and very easy to use.
"Pathetic customer service and rude behaviour! Firstly, they don't even deliver the products properly to the mentioned address. They don't take CoD orders if you have cancelled any of the previous orders due to your inconvenience. The customer service does not have minimum courtesy to reply to the mails. Totally disgusted with the experience!"
"Having good experience shopping with nykaa, find all the products with a good range."
wonderful experience
"it is a horrible / worst experience of mine for fast time to oder a lipstic from nykaa ,which came a very smaller size which was unexpected from nykaa, 2 thing the delivery boy which they sent is too irresponsible & unprofessional that he cant even pick the call after seeeing customer calling 6-8 times ,not even response of the call of us after calling keep on ,,3rd nyka customer team is so irresponsible who doest have any knowledge to whom they should cordinate to get product of the customer"
superw experience with nayaka love it‚ù§
"The very first experience was bad. Delivered damaged product, if someone pays for a product he/she always wants a fresh piece for anything they order. I claimed a return for the product but even the claim was rejected by nykaa. Will not refer to it anybody."
finominal experience.origional product
The app was quite simple to use. A smooth experience.
great experience with nykaa
"Worst application I used till now.... they say they will return the product within 5 days.... when we initiate for the return, we have to call them again and again for request approval and they reject our request after 5 days of initiating..... first experience yet very disgusting.."
Really bad service..not reliable and delivery is too delayed without any reason.. really a bad experience
Awesome experience
Superb Experience üëç
It's has always been a lovely experience wid Nykaa..... Highly appreciated!! Love shopping here!!
I think the products r duplicate here.... I hv ordered 2 lipsticks and both got damaged after a use Or two.... Very bad experience
"I am ordering from Nykaa for a while now and touchwood, no bad experience till now. Delivery service is too good, so are the products. Thank you for this amazing service."
"good experience over all, try options not their for all cosmetic products."
"Until now I had a great shopping experience with Nykaa and I have developed a trust in them over a period of time. But, recently something happened which broke my trust completely. I ordered a few Plum products worth Rs 1300 with which I was given a free Plum kajal. But, as I opened the seal of the Kajal box there was no kajal inside it, the box was just empty. I don't know whose cheap trick it was - the app or the brand, but, I am highly disappointed and angered by this."
my experience wid nykaa has always been delightful. best offers timely delivery authentic products. love d site
Very good collection amezing service very good experience and most important very good quality
Worst experience The delivery agent just rejects my prepaid Order without my consent and they never try to re-attempt to deliver my package The team also goes ahead and initiate the refund again without my acknowledgement . Which was a result of me waiting for the parcel for about one week
Very Gud experience with Nykaa. Original brands
great experience üòçüòç
Wrost experience and deliverd product
"great experience real products, fast dilivery"
Good Experience since 3 year
great shipping experience... i almost always get my deliveries the next day.
I love Nykaa a lot üíú Best Original Products at affordable Happy Customer as always .Best Shopping experience
not good experience at all. my first order for three items and i received only one item also it is two days late delivery. in my order section of this app there is no update regarding your order. worst app
"Very interactive user interface. Moreover, the products are 100% genuine and amazing delivery speed."
I had a horrible experience. My refund hasn't been given and for the past week I have been trying to contact them but its of no use.
"Though, Not satisfied with all the products of this app but overall its a great experience with you guys. I'll definitely mention the product brand i use to buy here, ""Mamaearth"". Genuinely reviewing, each n every product of Mamaearth is worth buying. Thanx Nykaa for such a beautiful experience. Hope you guys will never degrade your product's quality like others do. Thank you.."
Awesome Experience with Nykaa
Amazing experience üôÇ
I am re-updating my feedback. Although products are gunine i didn't have good experience with Nykaa fashion return. Nykaa had delivered wrong product and they are not ready to accept the return inspite of me providing them all details they asked for. So even if you got wrong product you neither get your money back nor they accept the return.
I have ordered some slimming tablets from nykaa. When I received the product it..some tablet file were empty...some were filled with half tablets..only 12-15 whole tablets were there instead of 30 tablets.. I tried returning it but there is no option to return it back. I have been shopping online since a long time never had such disgusting experience ever. Fraud!!
"Really a pathetic and worst experience i have ever had . Order placed on 9th and it was supposed to be delivered by 14th,on 14th it's rescheduled automatically by the courier partner. It's still not delivered,on every delivery date it's being rescheduled by them without even our consent. It's really a bad experience I will never recommend this to anyone"
"Many options, seamless interface. I am enjoying shopping."
good experience delivery is so fast as I receive d products before time packaging of products r really worth of praise .. products r genuine..lots of variety r available at resonable price .. sometimes offers r very tempting encourage us to buy little more üòÄ
Bad experience Some item missing or used
Good experience

Hassle free experience
amazing delivery time.... always had the best experience with nykaa...
"These people are liers.... Promising something and not sticking to it. Worst experience I ordered one product, in terms it was mentioned that if i return it within 5 days then they will refund my money, i returned it the same day it got delivered, they rejected my return saying that because of hygiene issue we will not accept returns. Then why are you proposing??? Same here guys now because of hygiene issue i am going to uninstall this worst app"

Such a poor experience with customer service. Wish I could rate 0 or even in negative for that matter. Wil not buy products from this site if I'm ever thinking of experimenting. Refund and returns are the worst
very user friendly interface and easy to navigate. i am very happy with my purchases made so far with the app. thank you so much! üòôüòöüòöüòö
Awesome experience with Nykaa
"Pathetic experience. No refund was available to me for products which had a faulty description on their site. Their defence was that we have updated our policy in covid where there is no refund for products which you wish to return, which they haven't. The customer care fellow told me that Ma'am its your mistake, you should have either called us to inquire about the details of product or else checked the return policy before placing an order. Nvr recommended as it dupes customers."
Wow! Superb experience with nykaa. Enjoying the free gifts. Love u nykaa for free gifts..üëçüòá

"Very Worst Experience. Very Worst Delivery Service. Delivery Agent Didn't Even Call Me But I Got A Message That I Requested For Future Delivery Of The Product I Purchased (Prepaid). There Is No Way To Contact The Delivery Person And The Ultimate Blunder Is That When I Went To Submit The Issue Through The App About Not Getting Call From The Delivery Agent, The Submit Button Is A Flaw. It Doesn't Work. ""UNTRUSTWORTHY"""
Great shopping experience
Wonderful experience
Very poor experience. üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°
"It's always a wonderful experience with Naykaa, love their products and services."
its pretty straightforward and clean interface.ive not had trouble with brands before been OG as far as i can tell .. so far so good :)
l have always had best experiences with Nykaa starting from its products range to services. But my recent prepaid order was not delivered to me though the tracking status said delivered. I would request you to use trust worthy delivery services for our products and please do reply to our issues by email
Very bad experience with nykaa... they never delivery in time... the delivery boy dont call. And they just return my ordee..... the fake apos
My experience with Nykaa is always the best. Every product i bought it just perfect for me. I loved it. Nykaa gives even discounts even we go to the store and buy we cant get the discounts. Thank you nykaa..
"Overall nice experience with Nykaa , I really love to shopping in ds"
Had a really bad experience with nykaa. Ordered something and got something else. Customer service also very bad.
I ordered few stuffs for myself and my experience with Nykaa was awesome.
Experience so good
"Very worst services no proper solution, I haven't received the product yet in the track option it says damaged but the chat support team of morons says it will be delivered, no refund received nor the product. Never ever gonna order again worst shopping experience."
Best experience so far üòç
"Seriously bad experience with customer service. It hardly matters to them even if your product is not delivered. They have irresponsible vendors who just update false status saying we are not reachable, but its not true. And no one in Nykaa will even get back to you after multiple follow ups."
I frequently order from nykaa it was just for once I recieved a dried eyeliner else it is a great experience shopping with nykaa.
I had the best experience with NYKAA
I seriously love this app my first experience was not good becoz I didn't receive my order but second and third one was brilliant I seriously love this aap and would like use this for the rest of my life
Its been more than 20 hrs I have sent the email regarding the refund. I'm just getting system generated emails and nothing else. Worst customer care service I have ever experienced. Also there is no contact number mentioned so that we can ourselves look upto the matter. Really disappointing.
My experience with nyka is just wow....‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Always a good experience with nykaa...I like their return policy..Never got my mo ey stuck...Very approaching and supporting customer care... Truly satisfied
My experience with Nykaa was amazing! A big thumps up for their delivery speed! They sell authentic products!
It's best for any concern.... Great experience.... WE LOVE NYKAA
"Worst experience of using nykaa. I have ordered mascara which had a creamy consistency and not watery. It was enough dry for lashes. When I asked for return, the support executive asked me to show the mascara swatch by applying it on hand to check the status. When I sent pictures, immediately after that she told that the product is used and they can't initiate return. Even after seeing the consistency of the mascara, she denied saying that it's not dry. I'll lodge an FIR against this fraud."
Very nice experience
"I used this app for the first time. Ordered 2 lakme products and 2 maybelline products. The carton package of one product of Maybelline was so old and torn....but the product inside was unused and in good condition . Same goes for other products.....due to this experience , I doubt the genuineness of products. But still I want to trust and quite glad with the services. Also want ot mention about the quick delivery , one extra star only for fast delivery.  Overall , the experience was jus ok....it could have been better.  A small suggestion, please add videos of swatches for the products like lipsticks, face compact, lip gloss, blushes etc to choose the best shade for particular skin shade and type."
I have a worst experience on my first purchase my order was cancelled and there is no message regarding the refund very irresponsive
Till now experience is good. Deals are reasonable.
Good experience
good experience
Worst experience and pathetic customer service. Whenever I tried to connect with the customer service person regarding my undelivered product I used to always get same reply to wait for another 48 hours. I placed order on 20th july and still I had not received it yet and in the app it is showing delivered. I already prepaid. I would love to rate you negative but I can't see that option .I would suggest people avoid using this app.
My experience with Nykaa so far has been pretty good..
Superb experience with nykaa every time
Worst app. Most of the products out of stock. Waiting for the products from a week and they are still out of stock.  Worst experience...
Good experience
Best makeup products experience... loved it... I have purchased many many products on great discounts..
This is the best place to shop makeup.. Hastlefree and so much variety.. The best is the creative interface. That's most important for a shopping app
Great experience so far.... Thankyou Nykaa for this amazing experience.. ‚ò∫‚ò∫
Good experience
"Delivery is smooth and fast. 100% authentic products, all brand products are available,loved the experience of shopping"
Excellent experience

Best experience...orders delivered within 24 to 48 hours...nice quality products.
"Experience is good with this wonderful website let's see what happens after 
getting the products..... If it's professional or just a regular based 
product rest I got every thing what I need for my daily use hope will have 
a good experience and results"
Amazing experience with nykaa always
Good experience so far üòä
i ordered two products almost one week ago worth rs. 1805. neither i recieved the products nor my money. very bad experience. will never recommend to anyone. I recieved those products within next 15 days after this complain. Thank u nykaa for addressing my complain soon. N i love d products.
The user interface is good
"nice app, deliver all the products in such a beautiful way that there is not a single chance of destroy. Always have good experience in the products purchased."
Awesome experience shopping...!! Must try.. They come out with surprising offers and deals..
You'll always be at ease while you're on this app. The experience is amazing. keep going Nykaa!!
Good experience
"It's a great app, nice interface, easy to use. It would be really great if real time chat option can be given"
Great experience
Absolutely amazing experience...genuine products ...very satisfying
"Worst experience.....!!!! Fraud app I orderd minimalist combo of niacinamide serum and pha toner but received one product which was dot and key vitamin c serum..... I complaint about same for more than 12 times through chat, emails at first they told to wait for 27 hours i wait....i shared images and have video as well but then also they refuse to return ..... Now they are saying that we had delivered all products correctly so we can't take any action on this...... Fraud app"
Nice app. Hate the new interface. üò≤
First time I have shopping from nykaa no experience
"Faltu app, horrible experience with delivery boy. I request him to come by 3:00 as he called me by 1:00 saying that m out of station right now, he said that if you want to take then take now itself if not m cancelling your order...."
Nykaa needs to improve on delivery and customer care services. My last experience was a terrible one.
best experience
Nice experience
Great experience.
I have been order first time from nykaa ...it was my best experience...thank u nykaa
"Amazing experience with nykaa. Excellent service provided by them you can blindly trust to there products, worth price and here u get amazing discounts... I m in love wid thiz app üíô"
Amazing app and genuine products. Easy to use interface.
good experience
Good experience
Best products and cosmetic genuine products Thank you so much nykaa For my experience
Worst customer experience.. Recently I have made oder through nykaa..i have not received my parcel yet. Continously I am trying to contact their customer support but no one is bothered about it. As it a pre paid order so it is a customer headache to contact them. Scam website
"Decent collection. Poor customer service. If you receive fake product/ return product due to misrepresentation then you'll not get resolution. lost only 120/- My multiple emails did not get a response over no. of days from customer service or grievance officer. Had been customer for 2-3 yrs with high level of purchases. First ever complaint and very poor Experience. 3 star for collection, 2 star to try with ok reliability but I'll not recommend this app. PS: Copy Paste response below. Useless."
the last few experiences have been just amazing!
Best experience with nykaa....best app..üòä
This app is really helpful and have a good experience....I just love shopping in it
"Even 1 star is huge waste for this app.Very bad customer experience. The products I ordered reached my place after 2 weeks. They told failed delivery customer not available. No one called me or messaged me or even came to my home. I did multiple follow up calls and chats. They told they are doing their best and they return the products after 1 week staying in same town. 3 weeks of time, money and patience got wasted. I finally ordered same products on Amazon which gives best customer service. :)"
Original products and awesome experience always
great experience
"I love nykaa 100% genuine products fast delivery....its a beautiful 
experience to shop from nykaa"
My experience with Nykaa till date is very good. It provides good service and products.
Very good experience always.
Nice experience
Its a pretty good experience
great experience....nice products
"Very disappointed with nykaa. Such a bad experience‚Äã. They delivered very old and dried cosmetics. After this they took almost 3-4 weeks to collect and refund them back inspite of writing so many emails, pinging them on FB and support on app itself. Worst online shopping app ever experienced."
"I had a horrible experience on this application. Recieved a damaged product and two missing items and I sent them several emails and calls regarding the same and they have not yet resolved my issue. Been harassing me over the pictures that I have sent them multiple times. Make sure you never order too much on from this website, if they deliver a wrong order they will never acknowledge it and keep rejecting your refund requests. Pathetic services."
Lovely experience
"One of the best shopping app made in country, the experience is amazing .Products are of good quality ranging from top brands to new sellers and how can i forget amazing discounts and sale time to time."
good experience..great packaging my only complaint is they don't provide return service. overall good experience
Great user experience. All the products are genuine. Lot of variety in cosmetics. Get great discounts.
its been a wonderful experience good range is available
"The app is fine.But, the customer care is horrible. Worst experience!"
Nice experience
Till now i have had a very good experience shopping at Nykaa.. now a days I buy all my make up & skin care products from Nykaa.. Best think is all the products under one umbrella... Thank you Nykaa..
having an amazing experience using online app . wide range of availability of products with frequent discounts and based on one's choice . faster delivery too i lovee itt‚ô•Ô∏è
great experience all the time with nykaa
"I always used to like the app but recently had a bad experience. I ordered for a few things on 25th Feb, but I am yet to receive the consignment. the courier says he cannot find the address. I did not receive call from the courier. also many emails to nykaa customer service has not yielded any response. they are not even refunding my money. really do not know what to do. I don't think I will use nykaa app again"
I love this app ....it has such a variety of products ..and I love the interface of this app very easy to use. ....and nd the offers are amazing
Not a good experience pertaining to offers. When I ordered I was shown an offer of purchasing mamearth products worth 399 and will get toner worth 399 free and this offer will be applied automatically but when I received the products it was not there and what I got was just an apology.
Bad experience - I have purchased lotus night from nykaa they have sent me expired product
Amazing experience
Loved the overall experience
Good experience
"I ordered using my 3rd order coupon, which was completely valid. They cancelled the order saying coupon used multiple times. I tried every way to make them understand the glitch in their software and yet these stone heads doesn't understand and now I lost my reward points too with that. They donot want to correct their problem! Disgusting experience in just 1 month of using this app"
Wonderful experience with Nykaa..Authentic product and fast delivery...
Grt experience!
I have the best experience from Nykaa till date. I hope they continue to do the good job. :)
amazing experience.
Good experience so far keep continuing the good work
Great app experience üòä
"Amazing app I have ever seen. At my 1st purchase I was little worried. But when I get my products, I was totally surprised. Now I'm buying every beauty products with Nykaa‚ô•Ô∏è. And the reviews are true to my experience. I'm in love Nykaa. I'm sure people not be disappointed with Nykaa. Because Nykaa also give u suggest products about your skin texture."
Amazing app. Gives great offers. Superb delivery. Amazing app experience. Great range of products.
I wrote a review and it was removed. Wow. Anyways app is good but delivery is pathetic. App would say 4-5 days for delivery but it will take 15-30 days without even tracking. Support just give a generalized email that please have patience. Not a good experience.
I love it so much had a great experience here
Awesome experience with this appüòé
It's been a good experience with nykaa...
Great shopping experience. Varied products with Wide choices. Delivery is fast and secure. Had to compliment on the packaging and delivery services. Thank you Nykaa.
Loved it..üíù best experience..
"I had placed order for 4 products through the app. Payment was done through 
net banking. Three products were delivered with no hassles but one product 
was returned without any information to me. When the concern was raised it 
came out that ""blue dart"" their delivery service provider had tried thrice 
to deliver the product which are false claims as other three products which 
was delivered via different delivery service provider had no hassles in 
delivery. When I contacted the nykaa team I got an inappropriate response 
that because of their stringent procedures once the product is returned 
back to warehouse it cannot be shipped again. If I place the same order I 
will again be charged for delivery service. The products are of great 
quality but the services and rules regarding the services are not up to the 
mark. Whole experience because of this incident has been unsatisfactory and 
for sure NYKAA has lost a loyal customer."
Very bad response with customer Maine 2 lipstick order kiya tha jiska shade mujhe pasand nahi aaya return and refund ke liye apply kia 4 din hi gaye koi response msg mail notification nahi aaya very bad experience with nykaa and maybellinenewyork color sensational creamy Matt lipstick ka color quality bahut kharab hi

my experience was good ‚ò∫‚ò∫best app ‚úåüëç
Nice experience
Great experience
It's been a very bad experience . The tracking order system is really bad. No reply to the emails. Still don't know where has the order reached.
super experience
They didn't ship my order on time. So I cancelled it and then they deducted 800 rupees from total amount for cancellation?? Is it nykaas cancellation policy??? Very bad experience. Disappointed
Always good experience with Nykaa
Very bad customer experience. The app don't help customer in any manner. They need to start valuing their customers.
Good experience till now. Quick service with proper products as mention in app
"Overall good experience with nykaa,genuine products with gud discountüëç"
Nice experience using App. Loves quick delivery and products are always recently manufactured. Never received old stock till data. Quality largely depends on manufacturer so a seperate issue. Keep up the good work. You are indeed saving previous time of ladies especially working like me.
Worst app experience
simply awsome experience.and very genuine product are available
"Good , economical and genuine products..delivery is fast... overall good experience.."
as always great to shop with. monthly customer. good experience always. üòá
Worst experience...I bought himalaya scrub...got too late n more than 60% was empty...nykaa cheated me...
"My experience with this app's terrible, images load so slow, browsing on this app is a task in itself and the customer care service is the worst. God forbid, if you gotta return some product then you are in a deep mess because its too complicated and slow. I really don't like the app. Only the good part is that they have some brands which you won't find anywhere else. But you need to up your game guys."
Worst experience even in the name of sale they send us expired products üò†
I have ordered things on nykaa on 8th of August and still haven't received my order yet. And they don't even care that the product has not delivered yet.they don't contact you only u have to contact them and they will give you only one ans ur parcel will be delivered. When am requesting on this app that i Don't want this delivery anymore then also they are not responding.worst shopping experience ever.
I had been shopping from Nykaa for the last one year. The customer service is good. Never had any bad experiences with Nykaa. They have a wide range of hair care and skin care products. Only one order was a bit delayed. But that's OK. Nothing can be perfect always. Anyways looking forward to more shopping from Nykaa. you üòäüòä
I am happy with Nykaa nice experience good products with amazing deals. I love it
too good experience i always had
I thought nykaa is very Good and I got a wonderful experience from my past orders but this time I had a bad experience with this.
overall good experience.
Loved the experience
Wonderful experience...loved this app...every product is genuine...fast delivery..üòò
Awsm experience with nykaa
best ever experience
Amazing experience üëå
"I have been using Nykaa since the past year. I have to give kudos to the team for all my stellar shopping experiences. The wallet feature really helps out, especially when you want to buy something of a higher range. A lifesaver, truly. The availability of foreign products made me into the ultimate fan. I have been following korean skin care for a long time but now I can finally get my hands on their products as well. Thank you, Nykaa!"
Worst experience i got a gift and compact powder of iba came with empty inside..... Worst experience ever.....
Nice experience
Worst experience.....product was not delivered to me even though assured by there executives that it would be delivered.
good experience
"I love nykaa.my all products on it are available whatever I want... reasonable prices, I got discount every shopping.... It is one stop shop for products of all brands, I truly love all my shopping experience ."
"Worst app in customer experience....i ordered a danniel wellington ring and guess what it was an empty box with the ring...not only this the icing on the cake was how they are dealing with it, it has already been 3 days and i have not been offered any resolution, i just want my money back or at least get me the product i ordered. You guys have already embarrassed me in front of the person i ordered it for so please stop this beating around the bush and offer a resolution."
It is really great experience. I am loving Nayka App and their products.
awesome experience in dealing with nykaa.delivery is fast. Best part is that products come with good shelf life.
very very bad experience with delivery and refund system.
All products are found. lovely experience with you .product quality is just awesome.
Very good experience I am having with nykaa hope it will remain same in future too
IT'S ALWAYS AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE SHOPPING WITH NYKAA. ALL PRODUCTS UNDER ONE ROOF!!!
Great UI experience
"Great experience, service is also very good. I was ordering from last year and I am fully satisfied."
loving thr experience
"Definitely go for Nykaa for cosmatics, My initial experience was not that good but it can happen sometime with anyone, nykaa provides great deals üëç"
Really good experience üëç
It was my 1dr time buying makeup from nykaa n that was a good experience. As everyone says 1st experience matters.üòä
Great experience
"WORST EXPERIENCE I ordered for maroon liquid lipstick and the one delivered to me was pink. I am enough grown up to differentiate between pink and maroon. Since the number I ordered and the number they provided me was same, they didnt replace it. Arey dumbo, that number is easily replaceable and those nyakawalas were having a stock crunch of that maroon lipstick. So they stuck the same number at the back of Pink lipstick and delivered it to me. I called and complained but they said sorry since the number I ordered was the same as delivered. My God. Nykawalas will now teach me wats maroon n wat pink is. SHAME ON YOU PEOPLE"
I am writing this review after having a horrible experience with this app. It's referral program is waste of time. They say you and your friends will get rewards. But the link they provide didn't work. Plus they are not ready to help you in your queries. So please guys use this app only for your purchases. Don't expect any customer care help or rewards from this app.
great experience
Amazing experience. The discounts change quickly though
amazing experience!
Very good experience
Very good experience each time shoping with nykaa
awesome experience
"Really love the app, thousands of brands to select from and so many offers. Fast delivery, great user interface of the app! Love it!!"
Its a wonderful shopping experience ..kind of one stop shop for all the beauty needs..
"Im having an amazing experience with Nykaa.. Its doing such an amazing job. Im very happy with its good products n very fasr delivery, it has very good service.. Thank you so much Nykaa ‚ù§ A big thumbs up for its job üëç Go for it guys ‚ù§"
Worst app. Return proceedure is very complicated. Hopeless. Need more user friendly interface.
My experience was poor ...the delivery is quite late ..and I am trying that I will never use nykaa app ...the blue dart service guy he doesn't know how to talk ..very rude behaviour ...he called me and didn't give my parcel ...very inappropriate behaviour
Lovely experience but Ya try keeping the products in stock
great experience....luv this app
"Whenever i ordered items from nyka they added a wonderful experience every time, i really love shopping from nyka. Very timely and provide full and authentic tracking information. Thank you nyka for making my shopping so great. hats off to all the employees ."
Very bad experience facing now no option to return the products üòàüòàüòàüòà

Great experience
Worst App ever.I placed an order and they didn't shipped it even after 3 days so I had to cancel it.Then I submitted a complaint to refund my money it's been 20 days and the money is still not refunded.After that I can't complaint from their app and through the email the representative always say we are sorry for the delay we will refund your money in 48 hours. Seriously very bad experience. Dnt ever pay online for any products on this app
awsme experience
Really useful app.. Had a lot of good experience buying.. It has a lot of offers which help us to buy even the costly products.. Thank you and keep goong
Good experience shopping on this app
I wish I could give less than one star.Worst experience ever. Plz don't waste your money.I have ordered first time during hot pink sale. I have ordered 12 products. Each and every product is fake. Barcode is giving fake information. All products are Chinese. During sale they deliver fake product. Cheap and old and expired. Nykaa we all work very hard to earn money. Plz keep original product. Discount doesn't matter. Quality does. Hate nykaa.
I had a great experience using nykaa. Less time consuming
"Good Experience with this app. , this is my second order, got the first one on time and products are superb."
Good experience and I'm happy with nykaa
I've just order few stuff waiting for the delievery then I'll share my experience with you all for sure
Till now the experience is quite good but I have one question......why is COD not available below rs. 500/-?
Awesome experience.
Had a good experience so far
"Fraud cheating website Send damaged goods basically get payment then dont care about ethics and customer service at all. So many people have had bad experiences people keep complaining on their fb page out of desperation and they give zero response. Only interested in new customer acquisition and making more money. No replies on mail, fb, calls etc for months... They just dont give a shi* I was complaining in customer forum for the same. That is how bad it is..."
Wonderful experience
Just loved the experience ‚ô•Ô∏è Easy to use and relatively faster delivery üòÉ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Awesome experience ...deliveries are reliable and products are genuine. God job nykaa......
Wonderful experience with nykaa!
"Well Nykaa has provided me with good n up to date service every 
time..people say they recipe broken products, but till date I haven't 
experienced any complaints as such..That's the reason I trust Nykaa.The 
cost which Nykaa provides are low as compare to other online 
sites...Looking forward for more shopping experience with Nykaa...A Happy n 
Satisfied customer...‚úå‚úåüëçüëç"
It was a good experience. The products are authentic.
Bad experience
Best app and best offers Till now I am having excellent experience with Nykaa . Thanks Nykaa and it's team.
Experience was good
The worst experience..because they have nothing to contact with them..whenever i have got the order i was always disappointed...and now if i want to return them...there is nothing like an option i can see...all is just a risk u take on Cosmetics and the amount u paid is paid u wont get that back...hate this nykaa app..worst worst and the worst
"I am using this app from last three years. This app is superb for cosmetic 
shopping...amazing experience. Please inform how to redeem reward points... 
thanks NYKAA"
The best experience
Products come very well packed and usually in 1-2 days. Love the experience.
Wonderful experience with nyka. Genuine products purchase.
My favourite app to buy cosmetic products and much more. Always have a good purchasing experience. A loyal Nykaa customer for life. Will never stop recommending this product to my near and dear ones.
Perfect shopping experience üòä
great experience!!
Good experience so far üòä
Great app. Offers are there most of the times or wait a little for the same. Experience is awesome and bug free to a great extent.
Good experience
Always love shopping at Nykaa. Till date have had the best shopping experience.
Nice Experience
"I had horrible experience with Nykaa. I have ordered some products on Sept 2nd and I didn't get my products yet delivered. Where as it is prepaid order & everyday I used to connect them for follow ups. Worst part is status of my order is delivered from 3rd Sep. Everytime their executive said new thing. Worst online process and their courier partner. I have faced it, so wanted to make aware others dont go for prepaid option. They're fake.."
It was an wonderful experience
Really an amazing experience with Nykaa. I have placed my order  3 day's back and today I got my stuff.. This is my first experience with you people and you guys nailed it. Thank you ..
Worst online shopping experience ever.I ordered for the first time but the delivery boy has got no manner nd no idea how to talk to customer.He made me wait 1 hour on road ..didn't pick my call..and when he picked up he rudely asked me to collect my order in another location far from where i was waiting for him or if i don't come he wouldn't deliver me my order that day and then cut my call before i say a single word.worst delivery service ever.
wonderful experience
"Worst service and customer service , I have got unsealed bottles created return request still waiting for the revert . Horrible experience"
Awesome experience with Nykaa. Thanks for keeping the originality.
the experience is really awesome... great deals and genuine products....
I always had a great experience ü•∞
"Good experience. nicely packed items, quickly delivered."
Good experience
It is a very good experience everytime shopping from nykaa..the most trusted app for makeup products and skincare products as it has all the original products..plus the delivery time is also less..i always recieve my order before the delivery date..
Best shopping experience with Nykaa. This is my all time favorite shopping site for cosmetics & makeup products. Very good experience with it till now. They deliver on time & the packaging is really good. There is a wide range of brands &variety of products to choose. I like the offers that Nykaa provides time to time. I can trust Nykaa for whatever they are selling. But I had experienced onIy one bad experience with nykaa refer & earn reward program. I referred this app to many & they purchased from this site but we both didn't get the reward till now & even i mailed to talk about it but no response.
Great experience. Genuine products with their expiration dates mentioned clearly. Love it . Regular with the app .
Best shopping experience.
Wonderful experience shopping with Nyka... authentic products
Very nice app.... good deals.... superb experience with the app... liked it a lotüòç
It makes so easy for girls to shop sitting in room and also giving a variety of products in same store. I find it helpful and also time saving. Plus getting offer is one of the best things for cosmetics. Thanks üòä but yes I want you to rectify your courier partner. Coz they don't deliver the products timely and also return it without notifying. I have that bad experience with delivery (blue dart) recently. I was waiting for my product eagerly. But it never got delivered.
Good experience
"Always a pleasure to shop with nyka.. while many online retailers have failed to provide amazing Consumer experience, nyka has made sure that all the customers are delighted.. can add more homegrown brands too.."
Good experience with nykaa
for the first i have purchased swiss beauty pro 32 color eyeshadow from Nykaa..but it was a very very bad experienced as i got totally damaged products..packing was good but the content was broken...i never recommend this app...purplle is better..
It is an amazing app and I had a nice experience with it as it provides best quality brand products and I would like to shop with it again and again
Has variety and quality at affordable rates. Lovely experience so far.
Best application. I have a 4 years of experience with nykaa and I am happy to say that this app didn't disappoint me even once.
My experience with nykaa is so bad like they first give you the offer on your first order and than they deliver you one product which is expensive among them and other products they cancel themselves and say address is not correct and any other problem and when we try to call for help they say you have to place order again where I won't get any such discount.
"I wish they could bring more affordable and working skincare products including the ordinary as it would be such a nice thing but I'm satisfied with what they have to offer. I love this app ,it has made my shopping experience so much better and nykaa tv especially helped me improve my skincare routine and provides updates time to time."
Very very bad experience. They don't deliver my order and refund also fake website please don't buy anything from here ...
Worst ever experience with any e commerce shopping platform
I have amazing experience with Nykaa till now. And in future I wish to continue my cosmetics shopping from here..
"awesome app, excellent service, wonderful experience. lots of love and thank you ‚ù§"
Good experience
Very good experience
its wonderful experience.. love you nykaa
Have got authentic products always..good experience to buy from this app..
Great awesome experience @nykaa!!!
good experience but the policy return and refund is not good
"my experience towards nykaa products is really very good. they provide all the products which you need in your makeup kit. This is the single platform for all the beauty products. I think Nykaa should bring a change in where customer wants to try the lipstick on them, but the shade meter doesn't gives the right selection. So instead of this nykaa should bring in where we can on our camera and try the shades on our Face directly. Also nykaa should introduce more products in nail art section."
"Genuine products attracted me. Shopping experience is good till now. updating: I am buying cosmetic products from last year and really satisfied by the service n genuine products, always. Thanks Nykaa‚ò∫Ô∏è Hi Nykaa, The delivery service become pathetic now. Customer Support continue to say have more patience whenever I contacted. Productsr are not delivered even after 10 days of order. We better go to the market and shop there instead ."
"Worst app, so as their customer services ,very poor in providing solutions. I ordered a product with gift wrap and a blank card, and i didnt recieve the blank card with gift wrap. When contacted instead of providing solutions and accepting the fault, they misguided and said that you didnt opt for that and i was firm that i did, above all they said we dont have such option (send me a blank card instead) there, My Worst experience of shopping online!!!! Even some reviews on producta are paid,not satisfied with them at all!!! Truly disappointed!!!"
Worst experience with this app
When I first installed this app I read a lot of negative reviews about their delivery services . So was a bit skeptical. Nevertheless decided to try it out. I am glad to say that my experience was awesome. They said I would get my products within 4 days and I did.  Nice product range and good  discounts . Keep up the good work !
Shopping experience is best than other apps
good experience
"Great user interface, on time deliveries, love the app!"
Good experience of the app
Great experience. Thanks!!
Getting experience
it's always been good experience.
"For the first time I used this app and ended up having the worst online shopping experience. Delayed updates, no provisions for exchange or returns and terrible customer service. It's better to order from Amazon and Myntra instead of nykaa."
Good experience üëç
Sensational experience from Nykaa
very good experience with nykaa and like continue nykaa relationship.thanks nykaa.
my friend used to shop all cosmetics and facial products from this app...so now i am doing that...and i have good experience with it to buy my essential products...
Worst shopping experience ever. The delivery person never called or came for delivery. I got msg saying the customer not available at least for 3 consecutive days when the delivery was not even attempted. I never received my package. Will never order again and shall not recommend this to anyone else.
love all my shopping experience from nykaa..
great experience
Wonderful experience with Nykaa
My experience is very good on this app as lot of varieties available and good offers and also the packaging...nly was having some issues as its advertisements were continuously on my phone but have also got good help done from them...thankyou nykaa...
lovely experience
Best experience
Quick delivery and easy shopping.Great experience üôÇ
this deserve great experience till now
Worst ever customer service..same thing is happening with atleast 1000s of ppl..I really don't understand despite all the complaints why nykaa is so stubborn to update it's after sales service.. even startups are offering better customer service. I recieved almost an expired product... Instagram team says my products shall be picked up but in app return has been rejected...why should I bear the cost of your poor quality control? Once again worst experience of nykaa's pathetic customer service.
"worst experience ever , didn't got delivered my order because it was not shipping the area and still order got placed.Im still amazed which delivery service didn't ship in Magarpatta."
My first experience with nykaa isn't good. Ponds white beauty cream was a part of my order. There was a free facewash with this cream but I didn't get the free facewash. I mailed them about this matter. I only got a system generated acknowledgement mail. They don't even bother give any response.!
Good experience
Worst delivery experience
Great Experience..
Gud experience shopping .. love the products purchased..
"Sometimes, the discounts don't get applied during check-out but otherwise it's a fairly convenient interface and prompt delivery service."
good price and good experience üòò
Great experience
good experience the products are of same brand and good one‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è
"This is probably the best shopping app... All the products are good... They come in a good condition... Their way of packing is also nice and heavy discounts are also given to your favorite products... Loved it, had a great experience.. üíóüíó"
Very nyc experience!
"The experience was good for the first few purchases but then it got worse. One third of my order has been delivered, the rest isn't. On the tracking page It says that they failed to deliver the products and has rescheduled it for 29th October and today is 2nd November. I've raised concerns 4-5 times and even sent an email but no response anywhere. Gonna cancel my order and perhaps wait for another week for my refund. Very disappointed."
truely awsome experience
Too good experience thanks nayka
Good experience with this app and reviews are also more helpful
I have ordered some item on Nykaa and paid it online. And i'm still waiting for delivery and it hasn't delivered yet. Worst Experience. My money got waste. Everyday i try to talk to support and they tell me my order will be delivered in next 48 hours but nothing. I wait and just wait. I'm still waiting.
Delivery was too late.Lost my patience totally. I had shared my location correctly.I thought product will be delivered to my address exactly.But the delivery agent called me and as I was not available I didn't lift the call. He simply went away and kept customer not reachable. It was really horrible experience for me as I called back many times and asked for customer support as I was in important work and wanted the product to deliver soon. Never wanted to shop with this app.Waste of time.
Its a great experience with team nykaa... Genuine products with discount
really bad experience I get from nykaa I have applied my coupon of 2000 but it didn't apply I have to pay all the money and my coupon is also finished
Site is good. Easy to use. Can't say how prompt they are about delivery. Will share my experience after my product is delivered to me.
"Very bad app this is.my experience not good with this app.it has no return policy.after delivery if you change your mind to return it.it is not available.if I want to cancel your product after order.it will not cancel.totally very disappointed with these are things. I really request to you guys,please change the policy.otherwise I suggest don't use this app."
"My experience with this application was good for an year but now I see how pathetic the customer support serives are.Despite being a Nykaa Prive member, these people have no respect for the people who are regular shoppers at Nykaa. Customer service won't get back on time and if they do it's some stupid bimbo sending an auto generated mail, and guess what IT ISN'T EVEN UPDATING AFTER ABOUT A THOUSAND TRIES despite being compatible with my device and no other applications aren't causing any issue!"
Good Experience
Good experience
Best app... always had a great experience... never got any complain about any product... everything is so smooth here...such a friendly app.... treat us like a family member that's how the offers n gifts are....I'm totally in love with this app...love you nykaa...most trusted app ever used... please never disappoint me
Okay I love this app and the range of things available here. The thing I don't like is the delivery service. I ordered something in the past and on the day of delivery I didn't receive it. The delivery person did not call or contact me in any other way and my delivery was delayed without reason. Well that was my bad experience but other than that.. It's good
I started shopping in Nykaa before their endorsements and my experiences is good till date..ü•∞
"Great shopping experience,good products, best deals and what else does a woman need.üòä"
"Very bad experience, on March 21 I was purchase two products from nykaa and I done online payment. One product I got, but one product rupees 562 , till now I didn't get. Costumer service and delivery was very bad. Worst Waste app, lost my money."
Good experience till now..
Sooooper fast delivery. Packaged so carefully. Always had an excellent experience. Happy to.order on Naykaa
Loving the experience as a starter to online shopping. Thanks Nykaa for making it super easy.
I had bad experience with this app I have order 6 products of nykaa they delivered only 5 I didn't get my kohl ultimate kajal and I do online payment but they delivered only 5 products üò°hate this app
Till now i have experienced good products on nyka and i believe this app.. i wish to get it in future too!!
Amaging experience with this app and i ami really happy to use this app
Worst delivery service. If you cannot take the parcel on the first day and ask them to bring it on the second day. They never come with it. I kept calling costomer care and asked for my parcel days after days but they couldnt help me anyway. Worst delivery service i have ever experienced.

Good experience..i can fully trust on nykaa products
"Overall experience is good, product range is awesome"
I never got any fake products. All the products were genuine and delivered within 2 days. Never had any bad experience with nykaa.
very gud experience with Nyka
"Earlier I had been liberal to this app for review but now my view has changed completely about this. Horrible experience while purchasing from this app. These people charge you even more than the original price of product. A kind request, never ever shop from this website. They suddenly change their policies once you make online payment. They are looting people. You ll get better deals from the brands websites then from Nykaa. Please check for brands website rather than ordering from Nykaa."
Excellent shopping experience and a great go to place for all cosmetic needs
Worst customer experience They show offers on their app but when you order something they never send the free items they make excuses and don't ship the free gifts which brand is offering and then they try to make it up to you by giving you cheap coupons. They stole my 999 rs gift and offered me 200 rs coupon. These people are fraud. Don't even want to give 1 star
Satisfied with my Nykaa experience. Been a loyal customer since 2014.
Just One touch you will have a great experience! Amazing products with great deals!
"Worst experience.... delivering duplicate and expired products, not recomended at all"
Nice surfing experience
Have loved my experience of purchasing products through Nykaa.. the delivery service is slow but thats possibly due to the lockdown. I'm pleasantly surprised at Nykaa's collection of XS-sized apparel. Was a revelation!! Great user interface and the feedbacks posted by users are very helpful. Very well curated website. Happy & definetly a repeat customer here!!!! :) Go for it Team-Nykaa with the fabulous job!!!
Very bad experience !
"Very bad experience , i ordered my order in dec 2016, still my orders are not delivered. I mailed 6 - 7 times for refunding my money back but  no reply from their side."
Good experience I love nykaa
Awesome experience. Most of the products that your heart desires are mostly available on nykaa. Its just that some products are a bit pricey. I think they should give discounts and offers more frequently.
love this app. excellent shopping experience.
Great Experience
Good experience with nykaa....Best app ‚ù§üëç Product ‚ù§ It
Great experience! Awesome Nykaa!
Nice experience with delivery and product quality. Enjoyed the interface of the app. Kudos
My experience is very bad with nykaa it doesn't have variations. i.e. when ever I type something I only get some products whereas in other apps there are literally more?????????
"I've been using nykaa from past two years but I never had such an 
experience. I've been waiting for my product since 10 days. No customer 
service to help. You get robotic replies for the tickets you raised and the 
people you talk. Nykaa you are going to loose your valuable customers very 
soon with such a pathetic service."
"I am unable to order from the app it's frustrating, there's a lot of bugs in the new update. Please resolve this team nykaa this really spoils my overall experience with nykaa!"
I love the experience of shopping on nykaaa..... Affordable cosmetics available
good experience
great experience in buying beauty products frm nykaa... fast delivery .... wide range of products available... only issue i face is selecting a lip colour .... cant trust for the exact colour which is shown here and what u will be getting.
Online best experience by nykaa ILOVENykaa ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Awesome experience
Bad Experience.Worst Service.I have ordered 7items from there store through app.In there site they are showing order delivered but in real i haven't received a single item.when i complained to the customer care they are forwarding me a pdf file showing order delivered with fake signatures.beware guys before buying anything.i have lost my money.just be safe.
"Great variety of brands and products to choose from, nice packaging. Great shopping experience and fast delivery. My to go for all personal needs"
One stop for all beauty and skin care products. I have been using Nykaa for so long that I don't think I even consider the thought of going physically to a shop to buy self care products anymore. That's how deeply Nykaa is involved in my day to day life. Their products are genuine and shipped with care as well. l have always loved my Nykaa experience. ‚ù§Ô∏è
I had a wonderful experience by shopping with nykaa.I loved it.I will recommend everyone to shop from nykaa.It stores authentic products.
"Nice experience, but they don't tell the expected date of products delivery.. If we are going somewhere then it's very difficult to wait.. Please let us know about the expected date. Otherwise amazing shopping experience"
"I love Nykaa. It has a great roster of brands and is always expanding to 
include great international products that we miss out on usually. I also 
appreciate their super fast delivery and how they tailor the experience to 
you as you regularly buy from them."
good experience best deals and best products
It's always awesome and advantageous experience ‚ô•Ô∏è
First time I had a good experience.But last time I had worst experience .....I bought a mascara from nykaa.firstly it delivered too late secondly when I got this this has no packaging and totally dried...no liquids....old product .....nykaa you should check the product properly then package.......I replacement it but second time same.......I wanted a refund but no answer from customer care.....so bad
Excellent range of products and user experience !
worst service by NYKAA really disappointed with you people worst app not refunding my money after my return request i will not going to purchase anything from this site and surely share my this bad experience with all my friends family and relatives also. what the hell are you people. why you don't approve my return request ?
Its always a great experience to shop genuine n amazing products here. And we get great deals too! Cant keep calm!üëå
Nice experience.
Best experience ever on this application.
Nice aap having a good experience
Wonderful experience
Good experience of shopping
"worst experience ever.placed an order with 11 products,got my parcel after a week and 7 products were missing out of it.i immediately called them. First they said they will look into it, but no action was taken.after 4-5 days i contacted them again, the agent said you will get your products within 72 hrs. yet again no action was taken.then i got a mail that every single product was delivered. this parcel was prepaid so now I am out of money and didn't get my products either. never using it again"
like in Bangalore the delivery is so fast..just love it..i love it so much that i order almost every week..its a dream come true for makeup enthusiasts like me..thanks for making my experience so good. <3 and plus you have discounts and offers almost all the time.. please continue the same.
Most comfortable and reliable application based purchase experience.

Hate the new interface so small hardly can see the products hangs multiple times and no major discounts
grear experience
Overall nice experience.
Amazing app! And awesome user interface experience ‚ù§Ô∏è
Worst experience ever. I bought from Nykka for the first time. I ordered like 7 products amongst them 3 is missing. I could have got those easily from the nearby cosmetic store but I relied of Nykka for the first time. Now Nykka is neither refunding me for those products nor even sending me my products back. Nonsense aap. waste of money and time. I can't believe such reputated brand Nykka can do this. I heard a lot from my friends about this aap but sorry to say I believe none now!!!
shopping experience is great !
Very good experience üòä.Good job nykaa üëç
Good experience But some times choose wrong thingsüòÇ
worst experience with nykaa ..they delevired damaged product and said tht refund will be dne with in 48 hrs 1 week passed after that 48 hrs and my refund is still not initiated
good experience
its be a good experience
Very disappointed in Nykaa. Product that I received is used one. Product is not new and 8 months old. Outter packings is done nicely to fool customer. If customer is spending money on something they at least should get a new product not a used one. Giving 1 star to my Nykaa experience.
nice experience
Good experience with nykaa ‚ù§Ô∏è
Worst experience.I have ordered so many items bt this tym i m totally feed up of Nyka's service. I want to return product bt they are not accepting the returns because of covid situation then where is the safety or covid issue when Nyka is delivering the products. If you dont want to accept return kindly exchange or replace the ones bt there is severe pandemic situation while accepting the return of product which is not there when customer makes order or when Nkya is delivering the product.
All Product's are so Amazing....i love it ....nd apamzing experience....
Received a broken item from nykaa.. tried to return.. but they didn't respond .. worst online shopping experience. Was a regular customer before but ll nvr order nythng again...
"Products are fine and while I admire all that they've achieved and done in their field, their return/refund policy is ridiculously slow and mismanaged. It takes forever to get a response. On other shopping sites its immediate. This took forever then they claim they tried to contact me so they closed my ticket. In any case why does it take over a week to process? Edit: amended my rating and review. As I otherwise have good experiences."
"Such a bad experience with nykaa,, they delivered the use products,, i will never going to buy anything from nykaa it is better to buy from amazon and flip kart atleast they returned the products whenever their is a defect,,."
"It's a really good experience shopping with Nykaa,hassel free shipping good quality products packed in a good way. Package from Nykaa always gets a smile on your face."
Everything else is really nice about except for fact that it doesn't trust its customers.. if it is a order which is paid online they take hell long time to deliver the order and the delivery team either deliver it to any body's door in the apartment..And I will have to go in search of the product each door.. or if u order cash on delivery the products come to u direct without even any waiting... I hope they processed orders irrespective of whether paid online or not .  I don't know if it's just my experience or everyone has dealt with the same.. but I really experienced it like with every order of mine.. and their customer service is always busy and that annoys to be on hold to get connected
"Worst experience ,,, I had to buy products worth Rs 1 lakh but due to some products being out of stock I could not buy. I also mailed but did not get any reply, I have been waiting for a month but I have not received any reply yet. Products are also not in stock ,, ,, I have not had such a bad experience in my life till date."
"Magical experience,you get what u want for your skin, hair and body."
"I love it. i get the products cheaper here. the overall experience is amazing. Three words- love, love, love."

"Good experience, my whole team use this app."
I really love nykaa & wanted to give it 4 stars but I have given ratings to so many producted bought acc to my personal experience bt I didn't hv receied any reward points. What's the value of promising rewards points & nt guving it to ur customer at all?? This is the only reason of giving my 3 stars to u..
Good experience
Wonderful experience with nykaa
Shopping from Nykaa is alwaz a great experience... products are very nice then to in minimal rates...Happy shopping customer...

Good experience .
was having nice time with this app..was about to reach 5k purchase on my birthday..but then they have given me the worst delivery experience. my product is still undelivered talked on customer care 4-5 times for previous products and delivery i would have given it a 4 star but this time seriously you turned me down really bad. not gonna shop again
Enjoyed the shopping experience
"This is one of the go to platforms for the daily household things for me and I so love this app. It never disappoints me in terms of availability of the stuff I want, sometimes the delivery time bothers me but I think as a customer we should understand that that's how the logistics work .....so yeah .... Quite happy with the experience... Intend to keep it in my phone at all times üôÇ"
great experience
Good experience
"Excellent shopping experience, smooth and Hassel free. Good information about the products and best was mention of expiry date. Thank you Nykaa"
"i brought ladies item from here ,where there one item delivered and one item returned by nayka without my permission and also not informed me that what happened to the already paid item , please return my money , you are not able to sell the material with this experience, resolution required as soon as possible,"
I have been using this app since months and delivery is always delayed if you make your order together delivery Is done one by one. it Is very difficult to wait for the orders the whole day.worst delivery experience even though the products are good.
some products stock is not available.. But this app makes a better experience in purchasing cosmetics.
Superb experience
Love the shopping experience üòÅ
I most likely shop from nykaa and almost every time it was great shopping experience( but I guess they are taking this thing for guaranteed as 2 times I received the same spoiled product I got at first place) . But I love the discounts & highly recommend nykaa.
Good Experience till now
Very nice app..delivery of products are also fast..had a very good experience..
i hv been a regular purchaser of nykaa n its really fun shopping here with lots of variety n no bad experience yet
"Worst experience. I placed an order but they don't deliver it at all. The 
customer care executives just knw to say sorry for the inconvenience 
caused. Never gonna use nyka for any purchase hereaft. Wldnt have given a 
single star too but cannot submit the review without giving any star."

I love to do shopping through this app.. Owsm experience.
Good experience
"Nykaa has been the worst shopping experience of my life. They delivered a non functional curling iron and one month after I lodged a complain, came back saying that they can do nothing to help. I suggest keep away from the website and read reviews before making a purchase."
1st shopping experience from nykaa was terrible they send my 5 item order in 3 different shipments 1 i got but and the rest gone back then again i ordered same items this time they sended my items in 1 shipment on my request and i got my items the packaging was good. Quality alos good all in all this time my shopping experience from nykaa is good üòÉ.

experience. Satisfied thnk u"
Great üëå experience üòÄ‚ò∫Ô∏è
amazing experience love nykaa
"Horrific First Experience, Do not recommend Nykaa. It is not all trust worthy. Nykaa cheated me by sending wrong product and customer service sucks. They have come back stating no return."
Love nykaa... the products are very good and their expiry dates are also very far so I think they are fresh products. And upto today experience is very good let's see ahead in next purchases. #lovenykaa
Overall experience is good
"Ordered few things 1 month ago.. Did not receive any call from delivery guy, neither received my refund yet even after several reminders and requests. Worst experience ever!"
wonderful experience till now.. will continue shopping with it ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Excellent experience with all the products üòçüëç
very bad experience from nykaa. not trustable.
Good deals..100% authentic products..I shop quite often & had good experiences always
Yes great experience. Very nice app.
Awesome experience in this app
The app is quite good....I am using since 5 years and it has been a nice experience the products are original and there are discounts also sometimes.
Nice experience. Hassel free fast service.
"My first experience with nykaa was extremely dissatisfying. Purchased a product which never came and never received the amount too. Customer care was not very helpfull. I will go out and purchase but will never trust nykaa. Called many times, wrote many mails but nobody helped. No response of mails. This was not what I expected out u people. Though I was always purchasing nykaa products from stores or from airport but online platform was not very friendly."
"Experience is really good, just the no return policy is making is not really customer friendly"
"Had a very disappointing experience with Nykaa. Bought two glamoreyes 
eyeliners one was Dragons heart and poisonous plum, very disappointed with 
the product, no match between wat s shown n app n wat was delivered. Will 
never buy again from Nykaa. going to uninstall it"
Best shopping app for original beauty products with superb discounts most of the time. Definitely recommend to everyone looking for a hassle-free shopping experience
An excellent experience
The reason of 4 star is because I have received fake as in duplicate products as well which is not expected but the overall all experience is really amazing thanks nayka for being really concerned about our orders and the packaging with all the bubble raps so the product is not hampered so keep up that good work I have been really happy with the service I have recently place an order with essential oils which is glass bottle so I hope they reach me safely as well.üòäthank you.
Good experience
Good experience so far. Sale segments also offers quiet good pricing.
Good experience
Very good experience with this app thanks Nykaa

Amusing experience. It has earned my loyalty.
"Good app, excellent experience and discounts"
I love this and product is amazing but experience but it is okkk

"Terrible experience with both the orders I placed. 1 I received was used damaged products and even after bugging there help centre on a daily basis, no action is being taken. The other product which I got a size bigger, team nyka says they won't be able to help me regarding that. Would recommend you all not to get trapped with the discounts"
Awesome experience with nykaa

Fabulous experience ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞

Yet very good experience. 1 feedback i couldnt find below every product whether its exchangable or refundable or not.
An amazing app with a great experience and great offers ...
nyc experience..
Nykaa always delivered fake and wrong product. For me bad experience and I deleted this app.
"amazing experience Everytime, all brands available , fast delivery service.. i just love nykaa..."
"I order a product on 6th July.. But till now I didn't get my product.i 
don't know whether its come. No customer support from their side. Worst 
shopping experience"
i had worst experience with nyka . i ordered some beauty products through nyka . it was delivered within time but one of the product was missing from the box. i immediately called customer care and also mailed the images and invoice of the product. but no response till now . i never experienced such things from other apps like myntra . at least they send the products listed in the invoice. though i trusted nyka i also paid the cash . and now in dilemma. its not like money showers from sky.
Its products are really authentic nd there are lot of options for those who are facing issue for branded products in there town.Really had a gr8 experience.i jus loved this app
"best app i experienced.what ever i hv ordered it is packed within hrs.best custumor service.i hv got the original product also. thank u for ur service,team nykaa"
There's nothing which I don't like about the app. It is honestly a great app which provides amazing user experience.
"I am in love with nykaa. Authentic products, great service and what not. Amazing experience from last 2 years."
Ordered 3 items and the shipment got delayed and then asked me to place another order... did so.. and it has been 4 days and yet the shipment is delayed... Pathetic experience... ! really disappointed.
good quality products and nice experience of buying...love u nykaa....üòç
Excellent experience of shopping with hazel free return..One spot for all girls need..
"till now my experience with nykaa is great this is the one and only online shopping site on which i trust blindly excellent offers , genuine products and above all if by mistake they delivered wrong product they accept it very very gently staff is very well behaved and coperative love you nykaa not only love but respect you üòöüòöüòö"
"Amazing experience ,original product's using nykaa fashion also"
"Worst experience ,Received damaged product and while returning the product option to upload photo is disabled in app."
Too bad experience...
The bakwass app i ever experienced in my life . I ordered almost 20days before but they are neither delievering the products nor refunding my money.3-5 times i tried to chat with assistant they are saying we can't refund neither we can change the delievery address .My almost 1700rs is going to waste because i won't be available at the ordered address but no one is there to listen my problem.They are considering customers as a fool. Because we are making payment in advance and let rest on them.
It's amazing app and it has original products as I experienced....
worst experience ever they gave my prepaid order to shadowfax which dsnt deliver in my area..it was really annoying exprnce..the delivery guy says i hv to go n pick it up smwhr & the nykaa customer care just kept saying we are looking into the matter even one of the operator hung up in mid of talk ..highly disgusted..i had been a regular customer of nykaa..n this level of baseless communication service wasnt expected at last i had to cancel my order after waiting for 10 days..disgusted
Great experience genuine products
"All time i experienced good service only but this time, the delivery services are the worst. Since 2 days my order is out for delivery yet not delivered.Delivery agent contacted on the first day and as i asked to drop the delivery in the address,he didn't do and also said that he'll deliver the next day mng at 10 am. But didn't receive it and it's been 2 days. Delivery agent didn't try to contact me afterwards. It would be better if delivery services are also good as the product quality."
nice experience with nykaa.. I always prefer nykaa and refer to my friends as well
Really happy with nykaa experience. It offers great deals.
"never has any delivery experience with nykaa been satisfactory for makeup, most of the time it's late to arrive and by the time the product reaches it's already out of vogue. And this time when I ordered apparel from this app the experience was worst. the size chart given is wrong. the return request hasn't still been approved after a week. At least state it clearly in your app that you won't be taking return or exchanges. We will then order off other apps that do what they guarantee."
Had a good experience with products... NYC collection...
very worst experience from nykaa.I ordered nailpaint of purple colour and they sent orange colour nailpaint.I return the product but after one month couldn't pick product and refund.I call to customer care more than ten time but weren't respond and their team is very rude.Don't trust on nykaa
"The app is convenient and everybody knows nykaa as a company has a huge collection. Speaking of interface, unlike most apps, this doesn't seem to synch with the browser. If you added to cart on a Web browser, it doesn't synch up with the app, despite using the same logins."
Good experience...
i using this app.for first time..i .think so it will be a good experience...
Amazing experience..one stop beauty destination..
"This is the worst thing I hv experienced abt ds app. U can't replace r 
return ur order. I hv initiated this issue before a wk but no response from 
them. If u r genuine then opproved my product replacement."
Awesome experience with nykaa

Superb experience with nykaa.
"What is wrong with you guys in promoting your application, in the middle of anything while surfing, this nykaa advertisement gets pop up, in most weirdeSt and loudest way possible, very irritating. almost every time this store shows fake offers, in the home page it'll show some different price, when you'll add the product in cart, price will be higher... worst experience."
I used to like to do shopping here but not now at all... Once I had ordered 1 dove conditioner they delivered me the expired one... I had spoken to customer service they were supposed to send someone to collect it but six months had passed but nobody turned up... Very bad experiences with Nykaa

Nice experience of shopping with naykaa
I haven't experienced any thing wrong with this app.Its been two years that I m using nykaa and Spending enough on brands which are high end or Economical for pockets.My Hope's were usually not shattered and I got genuine products. Although I am strongly disappointed that products are so not sealed in the brand packages.I mean I dont find it professional or whatsoever that my 1000 buck foundation is wrapped in bubble wrap.Kindly send the products in the packaging and later wrap it bubble wrap.

"Really disgusted with nykaa this time! Never expected that such a reputed app would be giving such a service. Even after repeated complains to the customer care regarding a damaged product, providing all the snap shots of the bill ,the product and everything that was asked, i still didn't get a feedback or any kind of compensation even After complaining five times! Pathetic experience with nykaa this time!!"

amzng experience nd i loved it mreüíï
Worst website ever so much delay in delivery I have been waiting since Sunday and today is tuesday. If you can't deliver on that day please don't say it. Is this the way you work for the costumers what's the use of spending so much money in ads and stuff. If you can't even spend some money and time to deliver parcel on time. worst experience ever.
Rules n regulations dy folow is bad.  Dey should learn from other online stors.  Very bad experience it ws..
"This app is a girls best friend . It contains wide range of products . Soo 
many brands under one place and great discounts . There're soo many 
products which are not easliy available in the market but you can have all 
here . Delivery is also on time . I've great experience shopping with nykka 
. ‚ù§"
"I think this is one of the best apps ever for makeup. Leaving aside the good available of a wide range of products, they have good advice, it's not biased against fair skin, it's scientific and actually helps. Plus they allowed me to change my shipping address which most other delivery apps don't let me do. Lovely experience."
nice experience
Good Experience
Experience with nykaa has been good so far but expect better services in return section as well...

Good experience of shopping on nykaa
Awesome experience so far ..keep up the good work
Grt experience
Very good experience by far. No lagging on play store app and good promotions
"Worst experience ever. Very bad app. I was ordered Himalaya Anti Hair Fall combo and body washes. And I was applied for Cash on Delivery. But they told me that we can't find ur address. But my all online orders from like Flipkart, Meesho and Amazon came in same address. I know that they made this issue for only Cash on Delivery. So for that r they can't told that Cash on Delivery is not available in this pandemic situation of Covid 19. Plz try to improve this Nykaa."
A great experience shopping with Nykaa..
"my experience has alwyz been good,, the delivery is basiclly done between3-4 days"
Very bad services with courier partner as delhivery .neither he call me nor he informed me by any way and cancel my order by himself and return it ...wow....such a bad experience !!!! Don't purchase anything from this side .. wastage of time
Overall it is a nice experience shopping at nykaa. I highly recommend it üëç
it's very bad experience with Nykaa ordered colorbar kiss proof as I tested it in local market and I was wondering that I will get the same product . but it's seems that I received the duplicate or fake product as it's very dry lipstick and become like a coloured powder which will falling out from your lips. I purchased lots of colorbar lipstick from local market but never had experience like this. so as per my experience it's a duplicate kiss proof lipstick
Good experience shopping with nykaa. Products get delivered with in 2 or 3days.
"Great experience, i get what i use . Thanks"

Worse experience First they said order is missing. Refund will be initiated. Then they found the order and said order is out for delivery. Delivery person said order will be Delivered within 10-15 minutes. Then he called again and said order will be delivered the next day. The next message came that order is out for delivery. Then few minutes later the said order is delayed. Costumer service is worse. They are not able to solve the problems.

It is very great experience to shop on Nykaa but you please mention when the order is going to come in before hand it helps us to keep the money ready
Good experience with cosmetics buying but buying jewellery can be made a bit more simple
Overall great experience.. But should have free shipping..
Pathetic customer service and application interface. I am unable to create a new account due to some error and no agent is helping me. It's been 1 month now. I wanted to do some shopping but I am unable to create account.
very bad experiences i bought some products which is not good ...then i return ...the product was return but not money....
When ever I order in offers....order is cancelled by NYAKAA.....order never get recieve..worst experience ever.
The experience at Nykaa is always wonderful. Thanks for this Beauty Overloaded App
"Worse ever. Ordered for the every first time, and they cancel the order without even informing the customer. Bad bad shipping process, and good for nothing kind of app. And the customer service, is the worst ever. All they say is sorry, and not act on making the customer receive the product they were promised. DON'T SHOP FROM HERE. Most disappointed experience ever."
Awesome experience. Love to shopping through nykaa.
Great Experience üëçüèªüòä‚ù§‚ù§
Fake product. Horrible experience
Dear nykaa I have purchased products many times from you but this time i am very much disappointed. I have ordered some stuff on 2nd of September 2020. But I have mistaken my mobile number and due to delivery couldn't happend. I have asked customer care to edit my number but they said they cannot assure me number will be edit or not and they cannot cancel my order or refund too. Still the status out for delivery showing me. I am helpless my money gone products too. Bad bad bad experience. üëé

Great experience
it was a nice experience to install and order things in it. though some items were outvof stock. I think being an online business u should always see that you have the products in buffer.

Amazing online store for cosmetics. i have been using this for more than 3 years for all my cosmetics. There are times i have returned or cancelled my orders. never experienced any problem in refund. they have genuine products. there is always a bad batch of qll genuine product too. so if u receive it contact them they might help u out. no such bad experience for me till now. I don't think i am going to store for my any cosmetic purchase ever. The offer here is much better than store offer.

I was worst experience with nykaa. Nykaa services is quiet good but its courier partner wow express is so far i am very dispointed with serivces .. After placing the order i have not received my package after 10 days ..After 13 days my package is not out for delivery.
Had the worst experience of my life....  The after sale service was the worst...  Trying to return a item from last on month but no one came to receive it....  Never gonna use this aap again neither gonna recommend this to anyone
"Received damaged products. The dove shampoo and conditioner bottles were leaking, seals were broken and all other products were spoilt due to the leakage. Worst experience"
Nykaa is very good platform for all makeup needs. It gives such a nice offers and we get all branded products from one platform. Very nice experience to buy from Nykaa
Great offers! Great fare! Great experience!! ü§ó
Good shopping experience
Great Experience & Genuine Products.
Bad delivery... They ask you to come to gowdown and pickup your order and they haven't mentioned this anywhere in app or while placing the product. Now when I ask for refund they say once it reaches warehouse and if applicable then I will get refund. Firstly they don't deliver on time next when you ask for refund they have there excuse. Bad experience I won't order from this app from now. I can easily get products listed here on othr apps with better customer support and delivery
Great shopping experience. Good products
"Always had a wonderful experience shopping from nykaa. Have purchased a lot of luxe and regular products from the site and I'm happy about the product quality, definitely 100% genuine products. Great going nykaa... ‚ò∫Ô∏è"

Great experience üòç..

"bad experience. As a mayday offer the app said that on purchase of ‚Çπ999 from colorbar will add up a free product but cancelled during the payment. on calling up the centre they said that the free product went out of stock and it takes 24 hours to update the website nd remove that offer!! but the next day and a day later they still promise to add a free product, thats not fair at all! nd they blame the company (colorbar) for the mistake and are not ready to take the blame!"
Amazing experience! Keep up the good work

Wonderful experience till date.
My experience with nykaa was good until i placed my last order. Since one week their delivery person is sending me out for delivery message and not delivering the product at the end of the day. And these people have been fooling around saying that it will be delivered within 24 hrs. They are not ready to cancel the order and refund my money nor are they delivering the products. Really horrible experience. I wish i could give them negative ratings for this pathetic service.
its nic and cheap products .....loved the experience üòç
Overall good experience
gGreat experience so far...please bring back the spin wheel
"Bad experience, bad product, high cost but product is not as expected. Such a bakwas app at all."
My experience is ridiculous. They have cancelled my order delivery and this is for 3rd time they have done. Such a poor service i haven't expected it from nykka i am totally disappointed . This app is just for promotion purpose rather useless.
my experience about Nyka is just awesome.

excellent experience
I have a problem with my order process. Why should I always follow up so nykaa can release my order? Been calling customer care since 2017 to release my orders even when payment is made online. Honestly fed up. 5 stars for the range of products but one star after calculating the average of range and service/user experience. do the math
Awesom experience
"Love this app, great experience shopping with nykaa....."

"I have been using app since yrs but this time worst ever experience. On app u can not use more than 1 gift cards in order instead it force u to pay with other mode. N shipping charges also not covered in it if any. Even if amount remains that's not added in total payment. Worst ever, app forces to shop multiple items without cust experience on payment page. Earlier I used it n was having good products but now not sure on quality especially eye liners n serums."
amazing experience with nyka..love all the products and the delivery time is apt.
Excellent experience ‚ò∫Ô∏è love nayka

"Highly irresponsible site & clumsy customer support. I placed my order worth Rs. 2000 (prepaid) on 10th of November, it was due on 13th of November, it reached the destination but it has not been delivered till date (today is 25th!!). Since I needed it by tomorrow, I requested refund, but the approval is still pending. Now, my money is stuck & I don't even have my products. Pathetic customer support. No value of customer's time. Very bad experience."
Good Experience I am very Happy
"One of the worst experience.i have ordered a few products Its not delivered

Worst experience of using Nykaa ..... I have ordered 2 smartwatch and have received only one and payment was done for 2 watchs. complaining to customer service was waste of my time.They were only delaying the matter.

"Pathetic experience. Todays pink sale offer said buy any 2 lakme products and get 3rd free, when I added 3 lakme products in cart, it said 1 offer applied but the total cummulated price of 3 products and not 2. It should have been 155 + 155 + 70 = 380 but the cart also added 120 for the 3rd product. And the total payment asked was 500. If you cant give offers, dont mention and cheat clients. Everyone is not foolish and specially I am not."
genuine products. experience can be made better with quicker delivery.
Amazing experience.
Always a great experience with Nykaa
Amazing experience..

My oder is not delivered its 9day to go but... Product are not delivered... Bad experience ever... Its a bad online shopping... I. Pay this but not delivered....
Nykaa gives you all the genuine products unlike other shopping apps. Delivery id perfectly on time and offers lot of discounts during festive seasons mostly. Overall its a good experience.
"such a waste of time , my order has been in transit from last 4 days , yesterday I called customer support, they said it'll delivered by evening but no one has called me , there are many apps which can deliver product in 3-4 days , bad experience."
Great experience
My Experience is Awesome with Nykaa and i loved it.üòç
very gud experience i m glad for certified products they sell
Great experience. Products are not duplicate like other shopping sites. Trustworthy.
One of the best shopping experience with reasonable price.thank you Nykaa
Awesome experience with nykaa...
Best products at best prices and app experience is amazing .
Best experience so far !!!!
Best app for cosmetics in India. Awesome experience. Product are genuine. Love.
experience was overall good..bt products are very costly
No experience but little happy
Worst service I always trusted nykaa for its products but it has worst service nobody solve your query .i ordered something which already took so long and it was to be delivered yesterday but without even calling me the sent me a text of failed delivery and gave the reason that I didn't pick up the call and I rescheduled it but still I didn't receive anything on that day .and nobody is answering me anywhere there is no executive available or replying to me ..worst experience this time.
Awesome experience. Superfast delivery plus very good packing of the order !
Bad experience
The delivery procedure is horrible.very much disappointed I ordered last week some product... every day m getting message that wow delivery tried to deliver but couldn't deliver. I didn't even get a single call from delivery side. M just trying to call nykaa and wow delivery no one is giving me proper response..at least give me my money back if you guys don't have any intention to deliver the product... Pathetic experience
Best customer experience
Its a really helpful app as there are multiple brands and products range. It also throws some amazing offers. So far no problem with the products but the delivery needs to be followed up. I experienced once that the package was not delivered to me on time and there was no intimation and I had to follow up.
Overall it's good experience to shop on this app.....
Excellent experienced with Nykaa..
Great App! Wonderful user experience!
amazing experience
My experience with nyka is amazing

Worst app ever and worst customer support. I'm trying to place return request for clothing items I ordered but it's not getting approved and I have talked and mailed my problem with photos to this nykaa customer care but very worst and annoying experience i got they won't help you at all I won't recommend nykaa to anyone! They just want to steal your money
Amazing experience
great experience..
This is my first experience but this app used by my family members an they happy so I tried it... Let see
"Worst app as per my experience. I have ordered one product and it's takes more than 10 days but still not delivered. Product is prepaid this is my fault,please do not pay in advance. Service is pathetic. Very disappointe üòû"
Nykaa Is good but the app interface is not very user friendly
Super experience with this app
Very bad experience with delivery dates and time. Product is late still they don't bother to inform or they don't even provide number of the delivery agent. Tired of contacting their customers support also. They don't bother to give any support to 16k rs shipment ! Am I supposed to wait at home whole day for how many days??? And then you show failed delivery because of rains. It was just 20 mins rain in the noon . And delivery agent started after that and then it shows fail.
Good experience
Such an amazing experience NYKAA has given to working women. I can order and avail discounts without going market . Thankyou NYKAA for supporting and giving good products. I suggest everyone to purchase on this app. Its newer or older ... all versions are good and easy to operate. Such a great experience I have received here.
great experience to shop in nykaa. genuine product

amazing experience.... love u nykaa....üòòü§ó
Worst app ever..i have orderd from ur site on 5nov.& Paid 1146 for the same.. this order i hv made was special for as it meant to gift someone but due to nykaa poor consistently service& bad reponse from client support as well it is not delieverd yet. It being 4 weeka now. This is the most pathetic experience i ever had from any online site.. i mean seriously do u guys care for ur clients & reputation in image. Ur client support are not able to give me any convincenal response... seriously i can't imagine u guyyzz r making fool ...
Bad experience Delivery didn't come on expected date. I faced a lot of problem. I wanted my order on time to give it as a gift. And it reached me after 3 days. Now what's the use of it.
good experience
Very bad and fraud apps i booked 2 items but delivered 1 items nd i paid 2 items charge...i m totally disappointed from dis site... i willnever purchase again...my first experience was very bad from this site..

"I have heard alot of issues for this app regarding the late delivery or 
product damage.but I have always had a good experience."
"Love the entire experience! Great collection of cosmetics and basic feminine needs, easy payment structures and fast deliveries!! not to mention decently priced products as well."
Awesome experienceüòäüòäüòä
Great shopping experience..must say it has very nice and fresh products. Only online shopping app which is best
I love the details that they provide. And good offers also. Although I have just one issue with the user interface of the app... There should be one home button while we are shopping. The Nykaa written on top should take you right at the beginning on the home page as soon as we click it.
Simple step to 'Beauty' ful world. Amazing experience. Keep up the service by delivering genuine products. üòä
Nykaa is providing a very bad user experience. Received wrong size and they are not ready to replace it with new. Package didn't have any other brand tag how will I provide brand tag which was not there in package delivered. Lost trust in Nykaa which i had before.
It was such a bad experience especially for COD. These people don't even contact you and just cancel your order without any notice and just see their audacity. Not recommended
Easy to operate.... Fast delivery... Awesome experienceü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©
My experience is good with nykaa offers should be more to give more profit to their priviledge customers....but some time before i purchased maybelline lipstick it was not original... i am a permanent customer of nykaa.i like this app too means i am addicted to buy from nykaa...if i have to buy something i open this app first means i am dependent on this app only for online shopping....best app..
"having a great experience with you,thanks nykaa"
"Thanks nykaa for bringing all the love that a lady can desire of. But if you can improve the interface and return policies, that would be so so much better."
great experience....
Good experience
worst experience!Highly disspointed as they wont return you the money you paid for the product that was actually missing in their package!They have been giving me excuses one after the other for the last 4months and I havent received my refund till now!
Loved the experience
Great experience But will be great if the try it on feature works for all products atleast for the brands that are used the most
"Yash Britto , Your service was really helpful to me as it cleared all the doubts regarding my product and its status . I had many doubts regarding the product and its shipping and its return and replacement policy. Your helpful interface and services provided by you were great ! Your customer service is very satisfactory! Will come back soon later on the store Ôøº. Thank you so much for clearing my doubts and guiding."
It's a great experience

horrible experience
amazing experience ü§≠ü§≠‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
I have a worst experience from nykaa...earlier the service was so good but now its that much worst.. i have shopped more than Rs 10000  and hv neither recieved any reward points nor my products on time infact they dont even bother about saying that its out of stock  .. when i order its available and later no update and the reason that they will provide you is you ve cancelled the order earlier thats why.... but they won't see that you have been the regular customer of their's. .. pathetic service... highly disappointed.. not going to shop from here..
I had ordered a few products 4 days back.. Got it delivered today.. Always happy with this experience but delivery boys are not wearing mask n gloves.. This is really disturbing.. We all know what is going on n this basic responsibility n safety measures should be taken...
Great experience
"When you want to return a product they start just ignoring you... Worst customer care service ever experienced. Called about 8 times to the customer care .. but no reply... I have shopped from Amazon, Myntra they are way better than this Naykaa... Just wasted my money..."
experience with nykaa is amazing.. timely delivery.. quality of product
Fantastic interface and amazing range of products
The experience with nyka is very good... unexpected discounts makes me really happy. üòçü§©
The agent was very unhelpfull and my product is missing still not taken any action and now they said we are unable to processed your request is this service they are providing HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE i will never buy anythi from nykaa
Wonderful experience
"Good site for international brands, genuine products.. Overall good experience."
Hey nykaa my experienced was too good but I want that u should start giving small hampers to your customers on theirs Birthday and Anniversary
worst experience
"My experience is gr8 wth nyakaa. I lv thr products, bst products in bst prc thnx nyakaa."
"Delivery and courier services sucks! From the last two days my order is getting canceled. And the reason is they didn't find my address and wrong phone number is given. I mean what th hell? Its not the first time I'm ordering online? Amzon has a great delivery system. But this one is absolutely absurd. Couldn't believe this that they didn't find my address. I called courier service and they aren't picking up my phone. Kept me waiting, and remember its not toll free number they even charge you for waiting..... üí©üí© worst experience ever! üò¢üò¢ i guess i have to cancel my order."
I got damaged stuffs today... one of the lakme matte muose..it had dried Another lakme matte got damaged in its front...another maybelline matte is totally broken.. and it had spread out.. very bad experience... take return ur stuff.. and return my money.. i would rather go to shop.. for buying lipsticks.. why you people dnt evn chk before dispatching. This is ridiculous.. simply u people are harrassing customers like us..
Great experience
it's always very great experience to shop with nykaa...... loveüòçnykaa
good experience
"Wondeful experience with Nykaa always..its been six years i guess, i am a regular at nykaa. Great discounts and authentic products always."
Please nobody go for nykaa. Very bad experience. Bad delivery service. It should not accept home delivery option..it should say come and buy. Never get any order in time or in place... always have to go courier center to get my order... I will never buy from Nykaa...and also will tell my friends too... Also will upload all my experience with my social media app...üò°üò°
totally disapointed experience they provide used material and damaged material and return policy is also disapointed
Nice shopping experience
Nykaa is the best! I find all products here Thank you nykaa Lovely experience
lv to shop with Nykaa... Amazing experience ..üåù
These people just remove bad reviews! I had the worst experience with Nykaa where the product I ordered is missing and Nykaa is coming up with one or the other ways to cancel my refund request. Guys please be careful while ordering anything online because there is no guarantee that product will be there inside the package!!!!
Loved my experience with nyka..
Amazing experience and I liked the quality of products .Nykaa sends original products .

The discounts are not as expected also a lot of products are out of stock but the buying experience was very smooth. The app is also user friendly.

"Very good experience, but delivery boys behaviour so root."
It's been an amazing experience shopping with Nykaa. I wish you guys start delivering directly to Dubai (eagerly waiting for this to happenüòÖ).
Amazing experience
"Worst experience..! All this while I was thinking the delivery partner's to be the real pain in ass as they had no mood and intentions to deliver the order but after making all the possible efforts to fix this I realised that nykaa too wasn't much interested in solving any of the issues their customers were facing because of their (nykaa's) own fault .I always had this good image of nykaa but after these last few experiences of mine,I won't ever recommend this app to anyone.Highly dissapointed."

Great experience using this app from a long time and love the products and offers :D

But recently i found that my ORDER DETAILS is not opening iam having a hard time to get updated on my recent orders which have not arrived yet amidst of this covid-19 lockdown...i would like to request nykaa to look after about my ORDER DETAILS sections"
Awful experience

I Love the app... So far experience with it is amazing..Always best quality products.. And always on time or before
"Hey, Nykaa is a well known brand, my past order experience was great and because of that I've ordered 7-8products at a time and 3of them were different or defected. I've ordered a Himalaya neem face pack which was half empty and it was literally disappointing. I've ordered a Maybelline mascara which was dry from inside and not even had any pigment on it My third one was Lakme eye liner which showed a different colour while ordering and i received a different shade of it it's really nt acceptable."
love the nykaa experience
"great experience ,,love you nyka"
Very good shopping experience till now with Nyka. Hope it will continue the same in future too.
Genuine products sold by Nykaa.But never got any discount coupon.But overall experience is awesome.
Great experience
Worst worst.. I'm using nykaa since start I knew products were geniune but since last two times have worst experience. Getting tempered n used products with ko proper seal n products are not real tried complaining on app but of no use.. Har bar 3k to 5k products order karti hu but since last two times yu guys are making fool of me.. Wanted to share pics here also but no option.. Customer service is worst no help from them.. App se complaint register nhi horahi..
Always a satisfying experience shopping from here!
"Had a great experience with nayaka, assured u good product in fine range"
Excellent Experience with Nykaa...
Awesome experience.... All products are verified... Also have good offers and sales... Go for it
Amazing app! One must definitely experience :)
WORST DELIVERY EXPERIENCE I was in love with this app...2 months ago... but after that...there delivery become worst...no attempt was made to deliver the order ..I didn't recieved any call...nd the was showing wrong address...I have ordered so many times...bt the delivery was never late...and from...2 months...this address became wrong and unable to locate...
I have a very good experience shopping with Nykaaüòç
Worst experience ever...  Even after putting the right pin code of my area at the time of delivery they cancelled order stating the area is not serviceable. Really disappointing
Shopping experience was good procedure of making order is easy
Nice product good experience.
Nykaa gives you the most wonderful experience. You can easily pick the products through description provided and the delivery is super fast. Nykaa always gives you the best products with affordable price and many offers. You gotta try it NOW!
My experience was Not v good bt prices are v nice
awesome buying experience!!
their pick up and delivery service is extremely poor... please do not pay them before hand ... and if you cancel the order the refund will take forever... i cancelled the order on 1st may that is within hours of placing the order... till date courier ppl are visiting my house to deliver those items and nobody from customer care has even informed the courier people that the order has been cancelled... humble request go to amazon and shop at least they are more reliable... horrible experience...
"Very bad experience with this app. Please don't believe this app. I done the prepaid payment using Paytm. Money deducted but order not confirmed. I raised the dispute through the bank customer support. But they suggested me to raise dispute with respective shopping app. I complainted to Nykaa customer care service and I'm tired of hearing ""As we have not received the payment, we can not process the request. Request you to raise a dispute through your bank customer support"" I got cheated"
good experience..
good experience..
Very bad experience i had from this site i have ordered lakme matte lip stick i got used piece ( its dried too) i kept return and replace also but no one responded and courier delivery guys also very rude in talking
Absolute one stop shop!!! Wonderful experience and very helpful reviews!!!
Seamless greatest shopping experience ever...üíïüíïüíï
My experience about Nykaa is really amazing i just love Nykaa..my favourite brands are available always available incase not in stock after available point it notify me.. I am always crazy for cosmetic....üòç
"My first experience was itself very bad..got the wrong parcel..and now 
taking so long for refunding..i won't recommend to anybody.."
Nykaa has always been an amazing plateform to buy every vanity need. The range of products and quality offered are great. My experience with Nykaa products has not been great but other tried tested brands are amazing including many new organic brands.
It's been quite a gud experience. But need some offers or discount coupons. That will help increase sales. Loved it ‚ô•Ô∏è
Beautiful experience ü•∞
Nykaa is a certified and verified platform to buy makeup related products online.. I have a gud experience of its services. I love shopping on nykaa.
"The experience is quite good. I am a new nykaa customer, but with my first delivery I was very happy. The app offers us great discounts with different brands, so it becomes easy to afford. Hope that I will feel more good on my next orders. Thank you!"
good shopping experience .best appüíñ
Pathetic customer service. So far the worst experience. It's been 2 weeks since my order is yet to be delivered. Delivery guy has his own mood of answering to phone calls and so damn choosy about delivery time and location. Neither I will ever buy anything from nor suggest to anybody.
"I read a lot of complaints in the Instagram comments section of the Nykaa page, but personally I've had a quite nice experience with them. They have some good offers and the packaging has been adequate so far. Hope that the bar goes only higher and not lower."
It's gud as far my experience have been wth the app
Wide range of products ..all genuine...using this app for a few years now and it's been a hassle free experience :) thank you nykaa !!
Osum experience
My 1st experience was really good. I think 5 star experience overall.
exceptional amazing experience....
a wonderful experience. Nykaa is love ‚ù§Ô∏è
"Nykaa was my first Order go to app when it comes to cosmetic nd i dint face much issues with the app so far. But now, when 1 try to return something for the first time ( its a wax which I received damage products and not useful) they two minutes to upload the pictures nd i did it 4 or 5 times. Stil the problem is not Solved and not a replacement over and over. Customer support is disappointing nd dint get responmse on time. Very bad experience with this app."
This is a very much bad experience with NYKAA . NYKAA provide me a wrong product. And I have not been able to return the product. Such a bad online shopping website.  HATE NYKAA
Good experience.
Good experience but can buy some products lower price than here.all together good.
My experience with nykaa is best....we had to go metro cities to buy good brands but now it's become super easy...thanks nykaa
Really helps in the shopping experience. Easy and convenient.
nayka showed thier love everytime i purchase...twice had good experience with product exchange n also getting free shipping ....i jst love naykaüòç
Worst customer support/service by nykaa. I have ordered 4 items by prepaid payment. In which one item was missing. I'm trying to reach out to nykaa customer support since 10 days and they are not even bother to reply contact their customer. Terrible experience with nykaa. I hated it. Uninstalling this app!!
pathetic experience this time......ordered my product on 24 jan...courier company sent fake msgs that consignee was not available.....then since 29 jan the product is lying in the warehouse....pathetic customer care service......these people are good for nothing....
"Have had an amazing experience with them. Quick delivery, and original products"
It's been a terrible experience. From wrong products to delayed refunds! It took you 13 days to issue a refund after the order has been picked. It took me countless follow-ups! You forced a customer out.
Shopping experience is the best.. Most of the products are available.. Great app
Pretty good experience on shopping for cosmetics ... Thanks Nykaa ‚ò∫Ô∏è ...
wonderful experience on nykaa
nice experience
Awesome experience... The products are of really high quality ‚ù§Ô∏è
I have a good experience with Nykaa... It delivered genuine products...
I have a bad experience recently . I love this app and products but few days back i returned my items and was expecting refund as they confirmed by messaging . But it hasn't refunded at all . Even after making several calls and dropping mails the money is not paid back . It is very disappointed and unprofessional behavior from such a well known app . Disheartened and frustrated with nykaa now .
wonderfull experience !! fast delivery n original products :)
Smoothest shopping experience with nykka
amazing experience with nykaa always
original products and exceptionally good interface.
"I have ordered cosmetics from this many times before,but this time my experience is the worst.I have oredered this time & paid already through my gift voucher .The delivery boy called me on 5th November & told me that he would deliver the parcel on that day.But when I called him he said for some reason he couldn't deliver the parcel.I requested him to deliver my parcel on 6th November.He said yes but i haven't got my parcel yet.disappointed with wow express & Nykaa."
"Flawless app experience,!!"
Great app! Loved the shopping experience. Have good deals too. Looking forward to more happy shopping ü§ó
"Great shopping experience. Shopping with you, makes me happy. Great work team nykaa. Thank you nykaa.‚ù§Ô∏è"
Wide range of authentic products available at reasonable prices with genuine reviews helping better decissions . Faster delivery makes the experience more pleasant. Also the delivery charges are waived as the minimum basket value reached.
Till now i have loved it and i have an amazing experience üòä
awwwsmmm experience with nykaa always shopping with this app only...
easy and comfortable shopping experience
"Wrost app i ever seen in my life . Very bad experience with this app. Customer support is also very bad I never want to purchase anything with this app..., üòîüòîüòî"
Such a bad experience ...I placed my first order 8 days ago ...it promised to deliver within 3 days ...but my order still hasn't arrived yet. Seriously disappointed. I was recommended to use nykka by one of my friends ...but going to uninstall after my first order gets delivered.
My experience with nykaa is amazing. Watever i ordered from nykaa were as per my expectations ...i loved their service and their products as well.Thankyou nykaaa....
Amazing experience ty nykaa
Great app.. genuine products... awesome experience.
Worst experience i ordered a wink eyeliner and received a damaged product so had to return it. The returned product also arrived damaged and then they said they won't return or refund as they were counting the time of return from the initial date of delivery i.e they even counted the time period i returned the first eyeliner and didn't even received the second 1. Pathetic experience. So if you are ordering a product and receiving a damaged product again and again they won't replace it again
it was a wonderful experience with nykaa the products were really good nd real loved it.... üòò
"Worst experience. Do not order from nykaa. They send me the product in the wrong condition and when i tried returning the product, they did not accept it. Not at all an easy return policy. I also shared a video with them. Do not waste your time on buying with nykaa app."
Wonderful experience with Nykaa üòçüòç
Amazing Experience Till Date! Maintaining Delivery times! Giving Importance equally if i order one product or in bulk and ensuring delivery promptly and perfectly! Thanks Nykaa! Hope that you maintain the promptness and keep up the excellent work! Loads of Love! ‚ô•Ô∏è
Good experience easy to use and attractive discount
Nykaa was not affordable because it's changed its policy to not receiving orders under 500 and also added additional 49 for delivery . Quitting the app .. disgusting .. worst .. bad experience
Grt experience and fast delivery
"experience is jst awesome ,,,pamper yourself with the goodness of nykaa!!!"
Shopping experience is smooth n no fake product
"Worst experience, worst customer service. They dont even provide their contact details or something to contact them. Its been more than 10 days and i havent  received my order. They dont even look concerned regarding the complaint."
The experience was more or less good. Just that all the items were delivered separately. I suggest to have a system where you collect the items from different sellers for the convenience of the customer. Also please start delivering on sundays as many of us who actually nuy stuff from nykaa are home om sunday which make it feasible for us to get the delivery ourselves instead of worrying about the timings .
Nice experience with this app
good experience
Great products and good shopping experience.
Amazing experience.. it's a very useful app for me!! Thanks for provide good services.
amazing experience
its wondrrful experience with nykaa it so fast services and quality about any product .ilove nykaa online shopping .
The app has really poor delivery services. My expected delivery was 9th to 10th December. I got my courier really very late. The prices are more or less okay but they don't provide good delivery services. The minimum order price for getting a free delivery is also very high! My experience with nykaa was not good at all!!!!
Great experience.. loved it... faster delivery... genuine products...
Great shopping experience with naykaa
experience has been good uptill now. products are available and delivery is on time.
nice experience
The overall experience of the app is pretty amazing. One of the best features according to me is the detailed product description. Even the shipping is usually super fast. In all a very good way to research on which product will fit your needs the best. Love it.!
I have so much good experience to buy on this app
i have stopped shopping from nykaa aap. had a bad experience. last time i placed order was on 10 Dec 19. i tried placing order on that day and Rs. 3536 was deducted from my account through phonepe and no order was placed. i talked to the nykaa customer care but the amount has not been refunded till date. i approached phonepe and my bank also but no use.
good experience
Gud experience
nice experience
Its good while using naykaa and hope in future also my experience will be sameüß°ü§û
Great experience...i am the permanent customer of naykaü§©
Whenever i shopped from Nykaa it was always an amazing experience!! I love nykaa But pleaseKeep up the good work!!üòä Best of lucküéâ
Good and easy interface
I have had a bad experience with Nykaa. They make you pay online and do not send the products. From my recent order half the products were missing and support team was not ready to resolve the issue. Do not buy products through Nykaa.
The nykaa app is easy to use with a great interface. The app is fast and shows all required information. The payment gateway was smooth too.
Haven't experienced anything bad till now..Great app for ur beauty shopping
Its was good experience of shopping but you should provide the facility of cash on delivery also
"Customer service is worst, tracking status of products is even more worse, refund is not in time, terms and conditions we have to ask to staff through chat for applying coupon code when it is not applicable, not clearly mentioned in the app. Worst experience ever! Time is getting wasted while chatting so much with the staff regarding the queries we have. Replies by them is also not in time."
"Before I had a good experience with nykaa. But last time when I ordered something first of all it is not giving me the right tracking ID everytime I try tracking it, it shows as page not found. Even the chat section now show me page not found this is the worst kind of service one can get. I am not asking for my order to reach me as soon as possible atleast let me allow me to track my order. Atleast make sure your customers are carefree when they know it is safe."
"I've ordered few products, looking forward for delivery. Hoping good and convincing experience. Love this app.‚ù§"
"I am loving this app....!!! It was my first experience, and I am really impressed with their work. My products were delivered on time and without any damages. Discounts are amazing, they saved me a huge amount of money....!!!!!!!üòâüòâüòâ Thank you Nykaaüòä"
its one place to shop for the beauty products good experience so far
Beauti like nykaa. amazing shopping experience . thanks to nykaa team
Awesome experience
Nice app Good experience
very satisfying experience with nykaa... Love to shop again and again
best experience and best products
This is best cosmetic application & user interface is Good .To give gift to someone is a good application for a cosmetic item
"Nykaa has good range of collection , I can suggest to add some more international brands though, but loved the experience"
I had a amazing experience with nykaa
I don't like it when I visit a beauty store and every sales lady gets hell bent on convincing me that their brand is the best. It ruins my experience to shop for myself. Nykaa does a great job at subtle suggestions and they have a great variety of products. I am so happy with your services and have made 3 more friends sign up! üòú
The fact that I use Nykaa just as much as any social media app tells just how amazing it is! Great deals ‚úîÔ∏è just as great array of products ‚úîÔ∏è Quick delivery ‚úîÔ∏è Never got any damaged or defective product ‚úîÔ∏è Additional prive member discounts ‚úîÔ∏è Completely changed my shopping experience...
A very good experience.Have been purchasing products from a long time.
Lately I am observing Nykaa delivers all the products within 48 hours. Amazing experienceüòç I am happy with all my purchases
Good products.. nd timely delivery üòäüòäüòä enjoyed the experience
Overall good experience. But their return n exchange mechanism is too tricky n tiresome unlike amazon (which i found user friendly)
I love to purchase all the products in this app. Till date no duplicate items have been delivered. Only thing is Some times packing is damaged. Have to address the issue. Two times I have experienced the same. Otherwise good app.
it is good experience
Good experience
Amazing experience... Would love to shop more üòÑ 100% genuine products
just amazing experience in shopping with nykaa!
This is the worst app ever. I ordered 5 products from the app and received only one of them. Four of the products were missing from the package and it was being shown as delivered. Nykaa team is not ready to accept this. They are not ready to share the number of the delivery executive as well. The remaining four products were worth 2000 and there is no compensation or help from the nykaa team. They do not have any grievance redressal for their loyal customers as well. Worst experience ever!!
Awesome experience i always order my beauty products from nyka only
great experience & products
superb experience with nykaa.. i love each n every product fearuring in this app.. love u Nykaa.. fantastic place for all beauty products
Had good experience before but recently ordered sone stuff and that has been not yet shipped..even mailed nykaa but no response....this kind of service is very bad...

Excellent experience while purchasing from this app as compared to others.
Superb experience everytime i shop with Nyka
I have many times login nykaa but every time i open its showing your login has expired so personally my experience with nykaa was worst
i love N Y K A A. Shoping with nyaa is fun beautiful experience .love to come back again n again. thank you NYKAA
Gud experience I select my product as well n very easy I m happy
This app is really good . Only one negative point is that we can't buy one bcz there is no cash on delivery below 700/- . So if you want to pay cash on delivery you have to but above 700/- . Over all good experience . Good packaging .
amazing experience!
"Worst to use Nykaa as there customer service is very bad all of the 
services provided are not worthy even to cancel the product they take days 
to take action and the delivery is also worst they always say delivery 
fails without even contacting me . And the costumer care didn't even listen 
to that . Worst experience with Nykaa suggest not to use it."
always having a great experience.
Loved the app and shopping experience
Worst experience with nykaa. They don't help you out with received product. Horrible horrible people. haven't refunded my money.
it was third class i ordered 4 products from which i received 2 n other 2 products were in stock but while processing they themselves cancelled the order n now the products are still in stock but at a higher price uninstalled nayka never gonna use it again. Worst experience i can say for online shopping
Love it have been recommending it to all family and friends nvr had a bad experience so trustworthy
loved the experience using nykaa app... its amazing... u can find every beauty brand here..
Not at all opening taking lots of I even not opened that bad experience
I'm having great experience with this app. There product packaging and servicing is awesome!!
Good experience.. their sales are LIT :)
Bad experience
Simply wow experience
"Good price, great variety n mainly original products. Amazing shopping experience."
very fast delivery & products are also genuine. nice experience with nykaa till now...
it was a lvly experience
My experience was great!!!Didnt take much time to select the products as images were ver helpful
Bahot kharab experience hai boat ka headphone mangaya tha 4 din hone ko hain ubhi tak koi update Ni.. upi payment kiya tha order cansel bhi karne nahi aara aur na hi order ka koi update
I hve ordered 1268 rs. Product ..so the delivery is absolutely free but why cod chrges 225 rs... it's too much ... wrost experience üòñ
"This the worst experience I had with any such platforms. I ordered an electronic product and I received a wrong product. I applied for a refund on the same day. But now it's already 10 days and the approval it self is not done. Everytime I enquire with the customer care of Nykka, they ask for another 48-72 hours...but still there is no movement on the order. I don't understand is this how customers are treated. There is no responsibility shown from the team and the customers money is stuck."
Aswam aap...it is recommended by my friend...1st time shopping experience is to satisfy.and products are original brand not doubt..thank you nykaa..
amazing variety of product with customer reviews..loved the experience
Great experience I love it
"This has made life simpler for makeup lovers.. but in the past I received 
few products which we're about to expire in next 3-4 months.. overall very 
good experience"
Good experience üòäüòä
Good experience.. products are genuine.
Awesome Experience
Been a great experience so far and I hope it continues to be that wayü§ó
"Lovely experience, i can compare different products and that is really good thing.. all the products are available here my mummy loves products of nykaa especially lipstick ü§ó"
It's a good experience.
"My experience with nykaa so far never disappointed me, u have always delivered the best quality and best brands to me. thank you nykaa lots of love üòçüòò"
I order the product but i did not received the product. I contact the customer service but they refused to solved it. It is fake site. Worst experience.
It's a great experience!
Had good experience so far.
Awsm experience with real products...really loved it
"Very disappointing experience regarding the delivery of products. A prepaid order is delayed. On calling customer care, the only answer they have that the order will be delivered soon and no timeline they can provide regarding the delivery. What's the point in giving prepaid orders and then waiting and wailing for your orders, which you don't know, when or if, will be delivered."
Awsm experience...... love doing shopping...my nykaa
Dont order from here guy's. Service is very bad. Customers care don't give you solution. Very bad experience. Just dnt usse this nykaa.
Overall good experience using the app .
worst experience how many times you need reminder for package delivery . it's almost half month over but my product not deliver and your courier partner told me i 'll not deliver your courier it's too much rude .... extremely worst experience now either give my money back or deliver my package ... ridiculous service. but your customer care service only talking about response they are not implementing their commitment . i really don't think so that your doing something about my issue.
Best shopping experience of the world class products
Good Experience
The go to app for purchasing beauty and make up stuff. Never had a bad experience with them. Just that they need to simplify their cancellation process and don't ask for clarification from customers on whys and hows on why they want to cancel.
Shopping experience is smooth and loved the price and discount. Always get d genuine product from nykaa.
Love the app. Exceedingly fast delivery. Amazing experience!!! Love the products. Wide range of choices.
Great experience...the beauty products are amazing with amazing prices and offers..
Best experience olwyz

my shopping experience is very good with nykaa.. now for beauty products I only trust it. but now a days m experiencing hang for a while when I open nykaa app.
excellent experience with nykaa
"I just loveee nayka, it was an amazing experience of shopping , almost every brand Almost hear ,it's skincare, haircare, make up range, and cosmetics etc, nayka provides big discounts all products ... ilove nayka"
Good so far as I trying it for 1st time let's experience the product first
Worst Online Shopping Experience Ever. After sale support is pathetic. I received a damaged product which cost me 4430 INR. After creating a return they will told you that please upload a clear picture. I do the same. After that they will told you to send email. No resolution will provide by the support. There motive is only to sell even the customer got a damaged or a waste product. They don't care. Waste of Money.
had a good experience with nykaa.good part is on time deliveries.very happy with products
"It's fun to shop for new skincare products, a huge collection Edit: I've noticed a lot of repeated product reviews listed, which makes me doubt the rating and the actual experience people have had with products."
Very good experience
My experience with naykaa is always amazing üòç
amazing experience
The app works fine except sometimes some of the products are shown as available but when you try to preview their sizes or add to cart it shows error message 'something went wrong'. Also sometimes the photos in the home screen are distorted specially the ones which are present towards the bottom of the page which we can see as we scroll down. Otherwise the browsing and purchase experience is good.
"Nykaa always gives me good experience, awesome app for cosmetic and body care products, just love to use it‚ù§Ô∏è"

Bad experience .very late delivery .. I was ordered 6th October but my product is not delivered me yet.

"Seriously love the experience, recommend other also to shop just to save some money and geniune products"
I have had good experience of shopping for beauty products. Today is the first time I shopped for clothes and I was a little miffed that none of the items had a size chart to refer to while ordering. It'll be great if you could include that in your catalogue.
Nice nice experience. Fast but sometimes little late shipping ..

My very first purchase. Let's hope for a good experience. It's easy to shop here
Actually experience was good but in March my order was returned back to Nyka.Because delivery boy was not performing his duty properly. He was not calling me and messages were coming that u r not available. I didn't got my money back. So this time I am hesitating to order from Nyka. Can you pl help me out.Pl just returned my money Rs674 or 664.
"It's been 4 years , and NYKAA has never failed me once. These guys are amazing. I have ordered products from worth Rs.500 to more than Rs.10,000 , and not even a single product was disappointing. Great Experience."
Very easy to find skin essential and other stuff here. Creative user interface.
It's delivery was very bad .I ordered first time from nykaa and my delivery time was between 4-5 days which is ok .once I receive the message that my package is out of delivery then also after 2 days I have not received yet .very bad experience .I need those products urgently and that's available exclusively on nykaa otherwise I ordered from some other site.
"First experience... Good, satisfied"
Worst experience... ordered 2 products and never received them and the customer care people do nothing about it ..
Worst shopping site. Placed order on 8 Nov expected delievery ws within 2 days but has not received order till now and no option is available to cancel the order even. First experience worst experience.
Worst experience. None of the pincode in my district is deliverable.
I am so disappointed with the service provided by you guys.I got a lipstick stinking really bad. I have spent my money for it n its not worth it. How can i risk applying such stale product on my skin. Also got brush totally broken from its rim.This was my 2nd bad experience.I m not buying anything from here.
"Loved it and liked it. Its easy, helpful and loyal. My experience of all time is very good. üòç"
"It's a great app but didn't give them five stars because they do not offer COD below 500‚Çπ, which is a bummer. I've had good experience with this app and they deliver quality products."
Nice experience
Good experience buying from nykaa..it is really good with original products and on time delivery..would love shopping more from it‚ù§‚ù§
I have always had a pleasant experience using the app.
Nice experience
"waiting for the product. i will share the experience, after the product is received"
"I'm happy with my experience till now. You guys have started shipping to srinagar and i'm grateful for that. However, i don't have any experience with your customer services. Overall happy with the app!‚ù§"
"Never buy any thing from this app. I bought two lipsticks and when the package came nothing was inside the lipstick bottle, i returned, but after that no refund! Nothing! Pathetic experience."
My experience with nykaa is so bad. Their delivery process is very disappointing.
I just love nykaa app.... experience was just awsm... nykaa is my every time first option ...
So far good experience
Awsum experience..I love to shop here.üòçüòòüòòüòò
lovely experience‚ò∫
"Had a worst experience at Nykaa. Ordered two products on 2nd Dec,2019 and didn't recieved my order till now 18th Dec,2019 but on the app it shows it got delivered. Worst customer service. On calling customer service they are saying it will take 45 days to refund the amount with 4-5 days to check proof of delivery. This is the kind of service nykaa provides. Really hated this experience which lead me to write this review."
First time on Nykaa ....Good experience
Great experience
Gd experience
Good experience
Good experience! Very good prices!
"Ever since i downloaded this app, i hve nt stepped into any beauty store. Theres  everything  u want n that too at gorgeous prices as they come up with lovely deals almost on a daily basis. So far i hve never had any bad experiences except for 1 where they missd an item in my shipmnt which was already late. But it got resolvd. Other than that , at least I nevr got any expired/damaged products. I shop frequently and this app has always impressed me."
I had a gr8 experience shopping with nykaa....it has great offers n also reliable products
great experience
"This app is my best friend‚ù§ Never had a bad experience with nykaa and 
always get my beauty prpducts at amazing deals, I only shop beauty from 
nykaa and nowhere else"
the most worst experience. there is no proper delivery system for this app. and you wont find any resolution for the products that are gone undelivered. i along with my friends ordered some products and we didn't receive them at all. And it has been more than a week since and these people are unable to track where the items has gone.
I have done a lot of shopping on nykaa.experience is gud except one gift.i got one gift of sugar mini set of liquid lipistick which is duplicate.otherwise all products were genuine. One thing more nykaa don't provide contact details of delivery agent we have to stick to phone so that we can't miss call from delivery agent. So contact detail must be provided.
Amazing experience with nykaa.
Amazing experience
good experience
Best shopping experience with enhanced sort and filter options
"Excellent and genuine products received so far. Genuine product seller as per my 20 years of experience in shopping fragrances from shoppersstop and from newly opened outlets like Sephora , Parcos. product being delivered in good conditions. over all excellent experience with this seller."
"good experience in terms of products,services and customer care. The best part of app is the aid they give or can say recommendation.I want to give suggestion that if can deal in dermaceutics products and online service from cosmetologist and dermatologist"
Very good experience
"very awesome experience shopping at Nykaa, offers are good , love you Nykaa"
I have amazing experience with Nykaa. It provides wide range of products you can choose for yourself. Thank You so much..
Good experience with nykaa till now... Hope will not disappoint in future..

wonderful experience... have purchased so many products at great prices... authentic products assured..
my experience never went wrong with nykaa. love this app. you can always trust them with make up and cosmetics.
A great app! Very easy interface and amazing options and offers on your favorite cosmetics and daily essentials! Love Nykaa!
My experience with its products was very good. But there delivery service and customer care service was worst like anything. Customer care people are talking rudely without resolving any issue.
hate this.i drowned my 300 rupees. third class fake company . sent broken products(lakme mascara) . my first & last experience was worst with nyka.it doesn't deliver on time especially prepaid orders.
Good experience
lovely experience always
Its a good experience. U get original products. App is very attractive. Its gotta be... MakeupüòÉ
Overall good experience
I just order few products didn't read reviews before..have paid through payU...Nykaa hope u dnt spoil my first experience with you guys..!! Was about to tell my friends about this site but now I think I should wait & see the outcome first :o
very good experience to buy from naykka
Awesome experience wid Nykaaaa‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è #LoveYouTeamNykaa üíïüíïüíï
"All my 7 products that i had ordered were different than the ones delivered! Called customer care, updated photos on app, emailed the photos to the cc executive yet no response , worst experience ever"
"BAD EXPERIENCE actually very bad one .I placed the order but there was some problem while payment and without even getting the order placed my account got deducted and the message shows I should place the order once again and they are going to refund within few working days so,I place the order once again paying the payment once again but it's been more than 17 days but I didn't get any refund it's like I have to double price for the product.....they have horrible payment refund services....."
Pathetic experience when it came to returning the damaged products. They deny it simply despite of giving all the proofs. Its better to get products from the shops instead of such scams #fraudsüëé
"Great experience, genuine products"
amazing experience..üòä
Nice experience
Very good experiences and the app is very trustworthy not fraud like other apps like Amazon. It has wide variety of cosmetics and skincare.Really best app
Worst experience.. I have placed an order.. And till I call customer care there is no msg or communication that order canceled nor The amount is returned..
My account was debited but the order was not successful 2 months passed still I didn't get the refund.. even nykaa support didn't reply me.. very bad experience..
Ossom experience with Nykaa just faced one problem while ordering compact it is always broken and half of it gets wasted other than that best app
This is really unprofessional you guys take so long to deliver goods & don't even inform regarding delay in process. They don't even revert on queries generated by Customer. Pathetic experience. ..n still continuing the same. Please don't download this app at all.
"Nykaa app is really good in terms of user experience, but they really need to improve their consumer experience - not expired products, addressing customer concerns etc."
"I have been using this app for last 3 years and it has been amazing experience , heading forward for the same . If u wana buy anything related to cosmetic nykaa is the app u can always trustü•∞ lots of love‚ù§Ô∏è"
"A very good experience with nykaa ,it's a very good quality of all the products üòÅ‚ù§Ô∏è..!!"
feeling good experience on it
very good experience
"I love everything about this app...the interface is very attractive,their delivery process is premium..just love Nykaa"
great experience....
Great experience good offers
awsome experience
Good experience till now
"100% pure, genuine and verified product saler app, you can trust nykaa for all the products available on it. Also it gives out the best offers which are unbelievable üòÉ. My experience with this app is best as customer service, product delivery, return , award points all are the best features to make a person satisfy."
Nice experience üòä
"I have a great experience with Nykaa app. But since from 3-4 days, I can't open my order details page. Please check and let me know ."
I have very bad experience with this app they unable to deliver product at time i have order products on 09/01/2017 still products not delivered. If you can't deliver products than there is worth of discounts.
"It's a great shopping experience. N delivery time is best. U get the delivery next day max times. Also, there are so many brands available to choose from"
Amazing experience ...love it
"I love the experience, I m your prive member, would love more discounts and good offers, most of time they are not much useful, eg if I want to buy a kama ayurveda product , discount of 5 or 10% will make me more happy then irrelevant offers like 15% on nykaa lux liner which I am not even buying, plz improve on this part."
App is good but nykaa is third class even after cancellation of order and receiving confirmation of cancellation they are attempting delivery again and again calling me from last ten days. It is new experience for me I am shopping online for past 6 years but never experienced something like this. This was my first order on nykaa but unfortunately I had to cancel my order because I was out of town due to my father in law's death and nobody was there to take delivery. Any way good bye. Regards
Amazing experience till now. It is really a great online shopping app and all products are genuine. I use this app mostly for all my cosmetics and face care products. The delivery is fast as well. Haven't faced any issues till date regarding orders .
It's a one stop beauty shop experience. Also my favourite window shopping app. Amazing products and User interface/experience is awesome..
Very nice shopping experience
Thanks Nykaa i have very good experience wd you.good product timely delivery nd good deals.Again Thanks Good Day
"Over all good experience, but there was an issue while having saved many items in the cart, screen would freeze, couldnt add or remove items."
"Hi friends, this is very worst app. Plz dont buy anything from this app.. I have purchased a product and due to some size issue i wanted to return or exchange but they didnt revert my mail.. They ignored me again again.. So i have very bad experience with this app."
Awesome shoping experience .
Very good experience üòäüôÇ
"Work experience at the very first time of my purchase in this app. No follow-ups, no updates on the delivery. No way to reach out to anyone at Nykaa. Just a dumb list of FAQs shown. I have not got my order for more than a week now. Nobody is bothered. No response to concern raised in the app....this app is a joke... This is after a week of haggling with the so called support of this app. I have still not got my order and this support of yours only and only sends out readymade email templates"
Lovely experience with nykaa..keep it going
One of the best and trusted app. Also they provide early delivery. So far i have had the best experience with Nykaa üòä
Good experience.
Worst experience with nykaa. Plz guys don't download this app. Fake product. Irresponsible customers service. This is the second time I faced the issues with Nykaa. If you really want to buy something worthwhile then please directly visit to your any nearby store but don't order something online. Hate this app.
superb shopping experience...i wish for more discounts
I love shopping online and my experience with Nykaa has been amazing all the timesüòç And the products are so good.. I would love to shop more in future.
Good experience
i don't know when you tried reaching me.mmi only knw that you guys have shared me a wrong POD in the name of some othet cx and her products...when i raised it...you sent me a fake POD ...wrst experience just because you people are not ready to work for the customer.. i have placed the order on 5 jan today is 17jan..have not recd any product and you are stating that i have recd the product...i am not an idiot to sent you emails and these reviews ..i have suffered alot just bcz of u people

Very good experience
I always love shopping from nykaa. Best place to get all the self care products and amazing experience. very happy to acknowledge that it's lead by Indian women üôÇüôÇ
Just received my order after 10days and guess what my streetwear lipstick is completely broken and damaged. Bad service bad experience. Dissatisfied
"Since the day I ordered from your website, I am trying to download your app in my phone. Tried so many times to do that. But having a bad experience on this. This was the first time I used your website. But so much disappointed"
Great experience...love this app
"I love this app.. Discounts and their speed in shipping is the best. Customer experience is something I would vouch for with Nykaa.. One stop for all brands, few international brands too :)"
Horrible experience with delivery more than once. Nobody from the customer care service also tried to help after contacting them continuously.
Amazing experience loving Nykaaü§©
"Easy to use, and i dont experience any glitches on the app."
Amazing experience always ‚ù§Ô∏è
good shopping experience with nykaa app
"Till now... I have a very good experience with nykaa... Looking forward to shop more.., thankyou team nykaa"
very good experience. u can buy any brand here. üòç i jus love it
Love the experience so far. Love how it brings to us various national and international brands together.
I ordered some stuff 3 to 4 days ago and paid the amount too but i am not receiving any news or updates about my order. Even the order history option is crashing from the second day of delivery. I don't have any knowledge where the hell is my stuff. I would rather buy beauty products from nearby shops than Nykaa. Worst 1st time experience.
It was a nice experience
"Best experience.....packaging,offers,brand.. fulfilled ü•Ç"
Good experience every single time
Good experience and i am exploring all beauty products

Nice experience with shopping on nykaa great discounts üëçüíØ
These people are cheaters. I had ordered 5 products of worth Rs 1200. They only delivered one product worth Rs 100. Rest did not get delivered. I called customer care many times and they kept on saying that it got delivered. I then asked for proof of delivery to which they said they will look into the matter.. it has been 4 months but still I did not receive my products neither refund. I am never going to use this app. Worst experience.
Not happy anymore !! Returned few item for the first time in years and after keeping the request pending for 10 days they have rejected the request without reason. Worst experience with customer care ... an old and regular customer (used to recommend family and friends) ..so disturbed and disappointed
bad experience...don't order anything...they charged me without giving the product
It was nice experience
Awesome experience ...easy n smooth transaction
nice experience till yet
"good experience..but I only have a problem that when they comes to deliver our product, they always calls us but if we dont pick then they cancel out the product. and again we have to wait for 2-3 days more."
amazing Experience. really good discount. genuine products for sure.
Nice experience
Wounderul experience
"I love shopping from Nykaa.. almost all the big brands are associated with 
Nykaa... even the Korean brands.. great experience every time I shop from 
Nykaa.."
"Day light robbers. Their return policy is non-existent, although they advertise otherwise. Uninstalled after a TERRIBLE experience"
"good experience with naykaa,.. nykaa offers are amazing. thank you"
It was in between experience not bad though.. Not happy with delievery duration
My experience with nykaa have been exceptional..All the products i have bought till date have been amazing....Keep up the good work and try to launch more brands like lancome n all...Absolutely in love with this app..U guyz are amazing ‚ô•Ô∏è

Wonderful experience
"Their delivery is too bad . I've ordered many products and never got the product on time ,their delivery agent never calls you even if you call they said we are busy today and your product never reaches you even after expected delivery date .worst experience with them never seen this By Amazon or any other site .worst app time waste ."
It's amazing. wonderful experience. Nykaa itself is too good.
"I hv great experience with nykaa,super fast delivery all products are sealed with plastic wrapüòçüòçüòòüòò"
"it was a nice experience from the"" nykaa"" app it shares the expensive things in cheaper price like nivea bodywash real price 199 nykaa price- 140 with free loofah it is nice you can definitely go for it.It also has the products that are not available at the stores .when I ordered from nykaa I ordered a bodywash that is in less price as compared to the stores and the original product"
Great experience
I am a new user of Nykaa. I tried to place an order and tried payment via internet banking and it failed twice ( its clearly not an issue with my bank) . So I tried to start the whole process again of adding to cart and now my new customer coupon code says already used. Why fake the new coupon code for the customer if the customer is unable to apply? Worst shopping experience ever. There are better apps available in the market with good customer experience.
"Outstanding experience,,,great platform for buying original & branded cosmetics... thank you nykaa."
Good experience
"Great experience with the products, luv shopping from nykaa"
I had a very good experience throughout!!üëç

It's was good experience wid nykaa üòäüëçüëçüëç
"I had very bad experience with support. I have ordered for the first time...six products out of which I wanted to return four products. Due to differences in shade. Firstly there is no smooth process of return, you have to chat to executive and tell u want to return. And then the executive told me that u have used the products, so we cannot take return. this was a wrong allegation. And the products were not sealed...so how do I know that nyka has sent me fresh pieces or used one....."
Very wrost experience. I'm ordered 4items but received 2items after that nykaa deny to help me. Wrost experience ever.
I have very good experience with nykaa.I have been using it almost for 3 years. Loved all the things. Original products and are delivered before the expected time. Thank you team nykaa.
The refund process is very slow. And they refund a lesser value.Worst experience.
My experience with nykaa has been great. I really love the way it works. The app is very easy to use as well.
superb experience in nykaa
"I have not received my product...they cheated me...but the app is displaying the product has been delivered..worst experience I had...I have all the proof , I want the nykaa team to return my money"

IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE WITH NYKAA
Always have the best experience shopping with Nykaa
I always shopped from your portal but my last experience of shopping loreal products was horrible as i shopped it from 70 percent off i was happily waiting for the product delivery bit guess what u delivered me damaged products all the products were damaged so i returned it u credited that balance to my wallet but what the use now i cnt purchase it again as the offer has been ended
best purchasing experience..they give 100%original products..and also love there online marketing strategies it makes quite easy for me what to pick and what not. #lovefornykaa do follow them on Instagram.
Awasome experience with Nykaa..every product delivered in time .
very good experience shoping with you
A very incompetent n unprofessional approach was displayed by the team when i placed an order.damaged product was delivered and on asking for a replacement i was told that the product is out of stock totally contrary to what i found on the app. The product was very much in stock. Very bad experience and would love to give them a minus rating had google gave us an option to do so. Will never shop from them ever again.
"Worst experience , I ordered a bridal jewellery set and received a damaged product which looks like it is used. The customer support is useless and just hired to say sorry. I dont want your sympathy nykaa i want my money back. Take this damaged product back and return my money. I have shared multiple pictures to prove that your product is damaged and not in a condition to use but you guys dont even bother even whn the customer is complaining. Take lessons from zivame and amazon to work better."
I used to love this app... But the customer service very worst.. They will send the used n damaged products and they won't accept return for the product... Very bad experience n very bad service.
It's a very good aap for cosmetics....I loved it..my experience is great with this aap.Thanks nykaa for delivering great services ü§©üòò
bad user experience. any the hell is ut always running in background???
Great experience... love nykaa
"The experience is good however, there must be a filter for 'country of origin' so that there is a choice of which country's manufacturing we will buy."
All together a very good experience of shopping. Just a suggestion many items are showing in wishlist which I have already purchased. Is there any option by which I can delete my wishlist
My experience about nykaa is too ossam because we order so much product from nykaa as every product is too good no issue in every product so I am so happy from the nykaa
Nice experience with you Nykaa ‚ù§
"delivery time is good-delivery happens within estimated time, need not to follow up with support to get the product delivered, payment hardly fails, searching experience is better."

Good experience
Its been almost a week and my order is still not delievered and neither i am receiving any updates of my order. Worst experience till date.. Nykaa is always late in terms of delivering the order although products are good.
Pathetic customer care support. All time horrible experience
Beautiful experience. Amazing products.

"Worst customer service experience. The CCEs provide different informations and do not respect the value of customer. Also, their return policy and timmings are not customer friendly. My experience with Nykaa was good all throughout but this was the first time when I had to return a product. And that is when I got to see their service in detail. It is surprising and disgusting simultaneously.All the posts regarding return policy of Nykaa are true. They have the worst policy ever. BEWARE!!"
The worst app to be used. I had to keep on Calling the customer center for my order to get delivered and even after doing it they just kept on making me wait by saying that kindly wait for 24-48hrs. But even after 4 days the order did not come. The worst experience with nyka. Will never use this application.
Great experience
Always had a good experience with nykaa ‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è
Best experience ever
Love the experience of having so many products and brands right on my fingertips and with amount of sales!
"Never buy jewellery from this app. If get a good and perfect product u are lucky and by chance you receive a defective product it will never be returned or forget u will ever get a refund. And it is very difficult to contact them. You want test patience then definately go for it. However, stick to buying cosmetic it's the best app for that and also the delivery is very quick. It's a luck based and get good and perfect is a hassle free experience else forget it."
"Timely delivery, well packed. No bad experience yet."
overall gud experience.....üòä
Amazing experience ‚ù£Ô∏è
I am happy to use this app as its has a lot of brands especially korean brands. It would be nice if they also introduce thai brands also. Had a nice experience shopping through nykaa!
I was a very loyal customer from past 15-18mnths but had very very bad experience from past 2-3orders. Dont evn want dt star but gav it only bcs i use to love nykaa a lot nd bought 100s of products.
"My experience with nykaa is awesome, always happy with nykaa ,the best app for me."
"Good offers, shopping experience"
I have had a great experience with this app. They have always delivered on time and correct order...love it...
lovely experience
I have been experiencing lot of trouble from Nykaa in this covid time. Every single order is delivered in 4-5 shipments with horrible experiences with the delivery agents. Even after complaining about these no action has been taken by team Nykaa. Repeated requests to send in single shipment fall into deaf ears.
I have been having great experience with Nykaa... The reason why I have given 4 stars is because somtimes the products they send looks very old and dirty (the package of the product) which feel like they have just changed the expiry sticker on the product and have sent us an old product. This is the only suggestion I have. Please check the product before sending it to your customers.
Return service is horrible! I liked the products they offered and was a huge fan of Nykaa.. but my recent experience was too bad. It has been 10 days I am following up for return of my product but still no response
To bad experience with then i order trimer from then its been 2 week am not get it and my product is reached ay destination then it go back. Don't order from nayka nows day if you want to buy the use cash on delivery option otherwise you have nothing
I have ordered one maybelline fit me foundation from Nykaa presuming that it could be an original product. But when the product came I saw the label 'Made In China'. I raised a return request for the same. Its been 3 days and I havent received any single communication from the team. Really bad experience. Will also instruct my friends not to purchase from Nykaa.
Not giving 4/5 bcoz many of times I have received duplicate products and due to this experience I don't trust Nyka much. I had complained regarding it and my issue was resolved by giving me some point. But still I would be more Happy if I get the original product. This doesn't happen always but has happened with me twice. Other than that your service is good. I still buy products from Nyka and I hope I don't experience such instance again.
The products are genuine and are delivered properly in good condition....I did not have any bad experience with this site till now...
Great experience
experience is good with nykaa

I had a very bad experience... guys do not buy product's from nykaa.. customer support is pathetic.. i am trying to raise complaint but they hang up on me.. such a irresponsible staffs.. i pity u guys to have such worst staffs.. i want to return a product but no help.. so called floor leader hung upon me.. very disappointing
Very bad experience with delivery and return. Return program is too slow. Most of the customer executives don't speak clearly. Very disappointing service. Better go for flipkart because they have a great customer service.
Best shopping experience.. genuine products üôÇ
"Ausome experience... good product,satisfied fully"

"Good experience, just try to give more offers if we shop this much from you guys."
I just had only one shopping experience with nykaa and that was the worst one.My order was returned and they didnt even notified me.I had paid the full amount through online and they are so irresponsible.They are taking even so much time for the refund procedures also...any way this is the worst online shopping app i have ever seen

very bad experience. have placed the order its been more than 6 working days and i cannot track the order also when called the customer service they make false promises about it will received in 2 working days. very disappointed.

Good experience
Best place to order for makeup lovers . Easy to find and choose products using this app for last 2 years it's been really good and handy experience üòáü•∞
"Worst experience with Nyka when u get stale product..!It is good till you have no problem with them..when it comes to exchange of order they literally give no answer to you for the genuine mistakes they did. I had ordered plum face mist and face pack and I received was a TRY ME product and seal open and the face pack I got was stale. I had a word with customer care after having so many follow up and then till now they are just reviewing it, no answer and it's been 3weeks and above now"
"My experience with Nykaa in the past few days has been horrible. I place an order. Courier partner accepts the order and later says address is out of delivery area. However, I have received nykaa products here. The courier partner doesn't contact you in any manner whatsoever and shows delivery failed. They ask you to place the order again.(without any discount this time). They ask you to go and pick up the order yourself from the courier partners location. Never ordering from Nykaa again. üëé"
Love this app. Have had a good experience with them. Delivery is faster than promised.
My experience with customer service was pathetic they are too rude
Amazing Experience. Just go for it.
Great shopping site! Genuine products! Though they sometimes make mistakes with the products but they take full responsibility after that and correct their mistakes. Great customer service team. Overall i had great experience shopping with nykaa.

I don't have experience
"My experience was good with nykaa until now as I don't order makeup every month or so, but recently I had a bad experience with my latest order..its been a week since ordered and it's not even dispatched yet and nykaa support system is just as useless and doesn't give any particular explanation for the delay."
The app has all the beauty products and in a good quality.. I have ordered it and it was a very good experience with nykaa
good experience but waiting for card on delivery option
"I'm ordering products first time from Nykaa, keen to feel the experience."
What I have experienced nykaa is a trustworthy app and I definitely would recommend to shop from here
Excellent experience Lovely
So far good experience. The only area of improvement for nykaa is if they give any complimentary article then it should be with the choice ( specially in lipstick and nail paint) so that customer can use the complimentary article according to her skin colour.
good experience. awesome wat v order v get dat in a such a discounts n delivery n packing is also perfect.i luv 2 shop product frm Nykaa again n again. thank u so much.
"Amazng experience , Recently I recieved Gifts From ur side and These r sriously too gud."

Horrible experience with nykaa....even after more than one month no refund has been made for the product that they didn't deliver....and they sent me a message about the amount to be refunded that is lesser than the amount i paid.....not expected this from you nykaa....i am sure now that i am never going to buy anything from your app....this is cheating your own customers...
very good experience üòÉüòÉ.All items are original. thanks
Awesome experience
Wonderful experience
Most useless app i have ever seen. They don't return your balance and when complained about that they said we will contact you which never happened. Going to delete this app this very moment. Very bad experience.
Excellent product options... wonderful shopping experience
The best app for ordering cosmetics. Their inventory is increasing day by day encompassing many international brands too. Really happy with the app interface and the delivery times are also fast. üëå
Worst experience nor issues are resolved on time. And the courier partners of nykaa (wow express) pathetic service
I love this app. There are so many ongoing offers all the time. The products are genuine and the delivery service is so quick and prompt. The user interface is amazing.
Up to this time experience is good
Mind blowing experience
Had a ‚ù§good experience. üëç
Have placed the order and found it defective so I requested to return and they kept that on hold .Very bad experience
"Superb experience, shopping here ! Product description and usage really helps in making an informed choices."
Nice experience. Good app
"Seamless transition! There's something for everyone, love the experience and product range from not only beauty but even personal care, pet care and appliances too!!! Way to go ‚ú®üëèüëèüëè"
good experience
Pathetic experience with customer support. They put your call on hold indefinitely so that it gets cut. No one addresses your query effectively. Products delivered were close to expiry so one has to finish using the product before expiry.
Love the experience of shopping online. It's a one stop for all your cosmetics shopping at the comfort of your homes.
Two time ordered cosmetics...Very Nice Experience
It's been a great experience with nykaa..the products are authentic and the service is also very good..
Amazing experience
They are selling fake products.Worst experience
Great application and products are too much good I have used this app last 1.6 yr my experience is too good .....
Worst delivery experience.. they delayed my delivery 3 times. No customer care response.. no care of customer.
Good experience
Hassle-free shopping experience with intuitive suggestions on research making it an easy user experience
Overall a good experience
Worst experience ever. My order is not delivered since 6 days of reaching the place. They leave a fake msg saying delivery tried and i m not available. Contacted nykaa as well as Blue dart. No help. I think i will hv to cancel the order n get a refund.
it was a good experience though but i want to return few items from it as it is came out as a same colour nail polish
"Worst experience.They cancelled my order which was of 609Rs(and I was saving 674Rs). They said it was returned to the warehouse.While I even ordered other stuff from Nykaa and it came just at an estimated time.It was the first order,so it had a good discount and they won't even give the discount and coupons back.So I want Nykaa to either deliver my order or to give the discount back.It is mandatory to do any one action.And don't delay your orders PLEASE.#NYKAA SUCKS."
very good experience with nykaa
Very bad experience order not delivered
"My favourite app for all kinds of shopping experiences. Just love the combos, varities & fast Delivery features."
Fabulous app...so wonderful...i dont really like wasting money but...whever i am surfing through nykaa ...i alwys end up loving many items and turn broke üòÇ ... High school students have such misery... but this app has everything and in a reql good quality and my experience has always been near to perfect
Nice experience
Excellent experience
Earlier i thought differnt about ntka it was my mistake i was wrong but nyka easily do the payment but when the turn about refund it takes time their refund date is over but still not credited in my account very bad customer service anf very bad chat service also... The product show something else and provided to customers different one.. It was so bad experience for me on nyka..
Worst experience ordered since 29th nov yet no delivery. NO CUSTOMER support. WORST WORST APP EVER.

Pathetic buying experience.. their courier service and customer care is in a sorry state. they just keep giving perfunctionary answers without actually trying to help.
I have so far had an wonderful experience with Nykaa!! I am loving it...And the offers are so goodü§©üòªü§û
I love to shop from nykaa....its the best shopping experience ever.....love uh nykaA
Very Bad experience with Nykaa. I am first time user. i have ordered a Papaya Face Scrub Wash and they delivered me expired product. I have raised a complain but they take a week to give me feedback and and finally refuse to replace my product. Very bad experience with Nykaa. Very bad support service. I will never shop with nykaa again. I always doing shoping with Amazon they never do like this with their customer.
"Nice and smooth experience till now, wide range of product with authenticity attached."
Nice shopping experience...
Great experience....i love this app
My go-to app for all beauty and body care!! They have improved the interface a lot over the years and its seamless and amazing shopping experience.
The worst shopping experience I've ever had with online shopping. First I was delivered damaged and probably used product and when I tried to return it they denied my request. I won't recomend this app .
good experience
Nice experience
It's a good collection of brands and provides good shopping experience.Tech support not very good.But the reviews of the products are mostly higher compared in other similar apps and the possible explanation i think is that the reviews are filtered and mostly good ones are knly posted.So i cant trust the reviews.
The customer service and support is the worst of all I haven't experienced this bad of returns or handling of problems with orders! For a app that has been so well established it is really tiring and annoying process with regards to the receiving updates regarding customer services!
Really good app for buying cosmetics. Ease of operation is also good. Transaction is also smooth. Overall good experience.
"Great experience,No second thought, genuine and original products,great deals . Everything works perfectly."
Amazing shopping experience. A lot of choices are available . The products are good and affordable . Delivery and refund are so convenient . I really love this app ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
"Worst experience ever they delivered wrong product nd never enquired about return i even called their customer service days, months passed nothing happened."
Bad experience   Its being a month since i ordered the product. Niether i received the order nor i have received the refunded money after cancellation.. you guys are cheater and ur customer care are irresponsible towards customer
Amazing experience with Nykaa... please add more products of companies outside India like New-Zealand
It was a good experience.

"Horrible experience I have ordered a epilator from nykaa and i received a 
defective product. Instead of returning they are saying me to repair it 
myself from the service centre. Worst services.. Will never going to shop 
again from nykaa Waste of time and money"
Worst experience ever
Superb products. All at its best quality. Delivery is also pretty much fast. I really love Nykaa. My experience with them is really amazing.
Superb experience
"I am so grateful to the creators of Nykaa for this app. It makes shopping for essentials and make up so damn easier. And much less expensive. I hated the experience of going to stores because (no offense) the sales ladies used to be a little to sweet and used to pressure us to buy all kinds of useless items in the name of ""skin care"". So I personally feel this app is great."
good experience
I always had an great experience of shopping from NAYKAA
First shopping experience
awesome. it seriously needs a great rating. The products available are excellent. loved it. It is good for buying cosmetics. My first experience of buying from nykaa was excellent. üòç
They have good products but I've personally had a bad experience with them. I received broken or old products

just love the experience on it
"Amazing experience,fast delivery"
"It has always been a great experience shopping at nyka.. almost every products are available here with a good discount.. never disappointed regarding their delivery timings, products, customer services..much love nyka‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
great experience with good prices
"I'm new to Nyka. Shopping experience is awesome. It has very good products 
and the discounts excites me"
There is no another app to shop make up rather than nykaa..In all good experience but they charge extra shipping for state entry üò®
Good Experience
Awesome experience while purchasing cosmetic products online. There is a lot variety of every brand. Their collection is too good. And main best thing is their delivery is too fast.
"Love the app. Very user friendly, almost addictive. wish the payment experience were smooth too. My transaction failed twice early this morning before it finally went through several hours later."
"Have been shopping using Nykaa for the past 3 years and It has been a great experience. Genuine and good quality products, super fast delivery and great discounts!"

Great experience so far!
Nice experience
It takes forever to deliver ! They always go way faaar the delivery date that they give. Not a good experience . Things are all good but what's the point if we don't recieve it when it was actually needed!
"Returning of any damaged product is a problem with Nykaa and they don't accept the damaged product if u want to return on the same day... unlike Amazon, Myntra and Flipkart where we can easily return the damaged products... Worst and pathetic experience with Nykaa.."
awesome experience with nykaa Love this app

Nykaa has always been a great experience for shopping. The best part is that it sends all the product ordered together in one day but other shopping app lacks this feature.

Something worth giving space..really convinient and an awesome experience PS: gotta know bout brands we never knew existed..üòå
"In the name of Customer Support and Gift Cards- this app is a scam. I would rather go to a store and buy products, if you can't provide a good experience then please do not advertise on other apps and steal people's money! A customer querey is something they can't respond to. I waited on the app for approximately one hour to get a response from Mr. Arjun that also a mere sorry and no help! Pathetic. I do not expect Nykaa to be so poor with service."
Superb and amazing shopping experience always .Products at reasonable discounts. I am happy .
worst experience with nykaa i ordered on 9th august i didn't received my order yet customer service is very worst they didn't take any action

Love the products on Nykaa. Good shoppin experience. Easy to browse.
"One app for all brands that's the best thing about it. I gave 3 stars 
because my first experience with them was horrible, didn't deliver my 
product because they say courier services were bad in my area also never 
credited back my amount. I didn't have time to follow it up also it wasn't 
that big amount so I let it go. Since then all the deliveries have been 
okay."
i love shopping experience
Superb experience and trust worthy
Very good experience but very late delivered my product
i had odered on 28th april but i have not yet received my order. it's been 8 days since i didn't get my order. i didn't receive any call from delivery man and i got a message that consignee not responding... worst shopping app ever ...worst experience
Great app. Got major discounts. Loved the experience.

Nykaa is a go to in dire need or shopping spree. One of the best application with easiest user interface and return or refund policies. I enjoy it a lot
"Hi Nykaa .. wonderful shopping experience and so relieved that u sell only authentic products, but one special request ..kindly include AJMAL YEARN perfumes and deodorants and also St Ives Hair serum to ur your range of products also Chloe love story perfumes would be a wonderful addition to ur range of products . Hope to find these perfumes soon on ur online shopping site .Thanks a zillion , Nykaa."

"i had good experience till now with all the products, i have purchased."
Wonderful experience
"U can get all your toileteries, night dresses, undergarments all under one app.. and an amazing shopping experience.. great customer service representatives.. I'm a loyal customer."
By far my experience has been really good regarding products.service is late in my city but free products you give sometimes are worst.you also sell duplicate Lakme lipsticks.
"I had really bad experience with nykaa twice , I placed order during sale, I was waiting for delivery and they themselves returned the order and when I complaint they ask to place order again on higher price , which is really unprofessional"

Wish there were more offers on big brands..over all good experience..üòç
I got my order but one of nailpolish is damged...I hve already initiate the replacement but still it's pending from your end. I want to know why this delay when I had already attached the picture of damged nailpolish. Why customer suffered when the problem is from your end .... I am not expecting this type of inresponsible behaviour by nyka...the worst experience..
"Nykaa for sure is a good trusted platform to buy all your makeup,skin,hygiene related products. They are always apt with the customer experience with delivery, product quality, Also have a very interesting ""Try it on"" feature for Foundation and lipsticks, which really helps makeup beginners choose the right shade for their skin tones, much appreciative. The app is user-friendly, no glitches, easy checkout options ( no gateway failures)."
"I had very bad experience with nykaa. They were picked product back from me 
but they did not gave me refund for product."
It was a worst experience with nykaa The product is not delivered on time...misplace of products Used products Not worth Buying From This App... I recommend its better u guys buy products from shop rather than hving cheap products from nykaa it's getting worst day by day..... hate nykaa very much... üò°üò°üò°
Awesome experience
"i have gud experience with nika , the products are original and can get a so much discount."

Experience with Nykaa is always great..üòäüòä
Really good products with great deals. The delivery is very fast and available at all places... Really good experience.
"The app is good I have ordered quite a few times and would be continuing to 
do in future. However today I had placed an order and also made the payment 
but neither did I receive the order confirmation in app nor the SMS.Please 
fix the issue as soon as possible for better experience with the app."
Good experience.. Nykaa is best beauty products app
had a very good experience with nykaa for both good delivery services and also return policy thank you nykaa ü•∞
"All in one aap. Couldn't have asked for more. U get great deals.. reviews 
are proper so u can choose products which have good ratings. I always shop 
from Nykaa...several times a month and the experience is amazing."
Tried to purchase lipsticks today did payment 3 times. all the three times money got deducted but the order is not placed .terrible experience from nykaa
The delivery is getting delayed for more than a week I didn't experience this kind of delivery in any other apps. I am totally disappointed of your delivery services kindly please try to delivery in excepted date
"I didn't get my delivery done yet and the help center didn't answer my call , the delivery boy didn't answer my call, they don't care about there customer at all , and if you want to return your item then there is lots of steps which makes you confused it's better go to the shop and buy from there , worst experience ever üëé"
Great experience using it whether it be product quality or delivery time..nykaa never disappoint even a bit in their service
Awesome experience. Love it
Such a wonderful experience. I received all the orders with in two days.
I mean its a pretty good app for makeup lovers or people who love to pamper themselves I Just wished that they would lower the prices more cuz even during the sales the prices r quite high n the other thing is that I hope that the products we get r authentic n nice cuz sometimes we still get products that r close to their expirey date So yea these were my experiences n concerns n I hope that nykaa u will look into these
I had a very bad experience with this app regarding the return policy of this Item. The customer care services are also useless as they don't provide any help. I will recommend everyone to not use this app. And I have also mailed to the support@nyka still my problem has not been solved. So their reply is also useless.
I have enjoy good experience with this application. I loved it
Good experience
Addictive and efficient shopping experience
"The worst ever experience from any online shopping app It is a clear case of scam. Looting the money by puting fake signature. Product is showing delivered but it is never reached me. No proper response from customer care of nykaa, on contacting via email it is said thaty product is received with a signature which is not mine. I have all evidence to prove that it not received and it is not my signature Very bad experience from nykaa Under process for a legal action Anyone wit same experience?"
lovely experience with nykaa.. highly recommended
Damnnnnn good experience for me as the products are real and protective for skin

"I wish you put sample products of luxury brands too.over all my experience

"So far, a very good experience with the app and service. Very happy"
Worst experience in the app it was shown than on sheet masks offer I ordered 5 but I not get another 3 why??
"Fraud people sent wrong item with cheaper value than i paid for, that too 
very late. For Complaint you will have to wait 3-4 days to get a reply. No 
direct contact number provided. Chat system is there to contact but nobody 
online. Home brand Nykaa product are costly and not worth. Bad experience."
it was a nice experience with nykaa n i will definitely be using it further
Great experience
In my experience it has been best website for purchasing my cosmetic items.. Thanks nykaa for saving my time n provide best quality of products.. I jus love it
"thank you guys for sharing your experience here,I would have thought of buying a product from Nykaa,before buying it I saw all your reviews,which helped me to save my time and money by wasting in Nykaa.From my part I requested my friends not to install this app and not to buy anything from Nykaa."

worst shopping experience.I have placed my order on 21 jan but still after 10 days I havent got my order.They are just showing failed delivery. I called customer care about 20 times and they are just giving fake assurance .They have wasted my time and money .Even they are not informing whether they are going to deliver or not I have to open app evertime i have to see the status of my order and it always show failed delivery. I am never going to use this app again.

Better experience
Good experience
"Overall seems good enough product,packaging ..the only thing they should focus that product should be delivered on the time as they mention as i have experienced delivery man was lil bit irresponsible,which i don't like about ."
"nice app, easy to use. appealing interface"
"Customer support is dead, I'm facing issues with an order I've placed and 
tried contacting you twice, everytime a ticket I'd was generated but nobody 
ever replied to them or called back. They're not able to ship a product in 
72 hours I don't know when it'll get delivered. It was my first order 
experience and it turned out to be real bad. All the best to the future 
buyers."
"Good experience  Nice quality products, good packaging,  fast delivery,  good discount,  nice sale"
such a bad experience... they never give original products... bad quality worst experience... never purchased from this app... üñï
"Bad experience, I am an old buyer and my return rejected though the product was of bad quality from pictures shown in listing. My 1000 rupees goes in vain."
Such a poor customer care service. No return policy avaliable. Ordered for the first from nykaa and was a bad experience not going to order again.
"Love shopping on Nykaa. Genuine products as per my experience so far, amazing varieties, superfast shipping. Can't ask for anything better. Absolutely delighted."
worst experience with delivery and in name of customer support they have nothing.
Worst experience ever. The return policy is worst. I dont want a product i am trying to return it but the app is not giving approval to it. Worst app ever i will never purchase anything from nykaa.hate this app
Great shopping experience with nice offers and discounts Loving this app
Amazing experience
Good experience üëç
Pretty good experience
It's a good experience to shop from here
"loved my first experience of shopping here! fast delivery, excellent safe packaging ‚ù§"
Amazing experience .
I have been using Nykaa for quite long..my experience with the app so far has been wonderful with on time delivery and no hassle while returning the items...the only problem is that the product reviews are quite misleading. The same names with the same reviews have been repeated again and again just to increase the number of positive reviews and that too on most of the popular brands..so this needs to be looked upon because customers do depend on reviews if they are trying to buy the product for the first time.
it was a great experience with nykaa
Worst experience to shop with nykaa I didn't receive my order yet and customer care says daily that ur order is delivered before the end of the day and i have already paid the amount
*Customer Ease Purchase. *Attractive Discounts. *Great Delivery Experience. *Tracking details are recieved through WhatsApp. * Depandable Products.
great experience
Great experience with Nykaa
Very nice experience
Nice experience
Worst experience ever. It's my humble request to you all that don't install this unfaithful application in your mobile phones for shopping purposes. I just ordered a product in which there was a return policy for 5 days and when I don't like the product so I decided to return it so they rejected my return request and when I contact the costumer care of this app so they continuously started proving me wrong and they started explaining fake return policies so don't trust them coz they are cheaters
"Clearly after purchsng products I understood tht it's return policies are not really easy and convenient, I recvd my ordr already late and tht too wrong product, after writing it in app about the ordrs they dint respond again I had to reach and ask abt its status and I was asked to send more proofs! This is the most pathetic experience I have ever had, it was clearly seen that the products are wrong maybe nyka doesn't have a team of professionals to understand that difference."
most satisfied experience with Nykaa thank you so much
"Best shopping experience always, despite delivery charges it gives products at less price compared to Flipkart and Amazon."
Lovely app. Cosmetic shopping become amazing experience for me
Worst experience
unable to pay on the orders having COD unavailable...very bad experience
Love the new UI experience!
Before lockdown I have bought a body shaper & they delivered a damaged product ....i tried a lot to exchng as it was mentioned bt they did not reply.... Bad experience.
Really an awesome experience
"Always had a great shopping experience with nykaa. Orginal products, looking forward for more great shopping from nykaa."
"Worst app, very bad experience."
great experience timely delivery
Great shopping experience and offers
On ordering on this app I got a damaged product and contacted them several times but no action was taken. Worst experience. Never going to buy anything from this app anymore. No money was refunded nor it was replaced. This is a very bad way of dealing with their customers.
My experience with nykaa has always been amazing
"After a very bad experience, nykaa has resolved my problem. So happy with there services. Looking forward for more exciting offers."

I had a very bad experience . The product I got is completely damaged . It was my first order from nykaa . Now I'm not willing to order more. I'm very disappointed.
Awesome experience
"The app is good, easy to search for products. However Ive experienced an issue where the products I search or add in cart appear on several unwarranted websites as advertisement.. This makes me wary of the fact that a customers details is not being secured properly and is prone to leak data.  Due to this I avoid online payment on this app and choose cash payments only"
It is always a best experience shopping with nykaa
awesome experience
Amazing experience.
I have been in love with nykaa since my first purchase order. Never a disappointing experience.
It's really a good experience; from a good time.
Till now wht ever I shop from nykaa my experience was superb
"Very prompt shipping, ease and fast navigation within the app. One shop stop for wide range of beauty products from Low to High range luxury products with continuous offers. Filtering helps a lot to chose products by skin type, concerns, categories of products from Body part to price range. Loved the experience of using Nykaa !!"

Shopping here was a pleasant experience. I got the exact products within the estimated time. :)
there been time when they diliverd a authentic products but my worst experience with nykaa is that for one product i still havent receive a payment when i returned it long back been calling them but no point so i gave up!
Very good experience with Nykaa Ontime delivery and good service overall
My experience is very good with nykaa. It's a best app for all makeup lovers women.
My experience was gud
"Worst online shopping experience because of this app. I tried to return a product.First, they don't have a separate return/exchange option.They say that it takes 1-2 days to initiate the return request. But for me its been more than 10 days. The app doesn't show what the problem is with your return request. You have to call their customer care everyday which is as helpful as the app that is so obvious that a normal person can tell you.They keep on saying it will be done soon but nothing happens"
It was my first experience from Nykaa. Please try to stock affordable Makeup vanity box
Great customer service from Nykaa's end. Love the app but the customer service is something which makes the experience wonderful!
Very good experience...and fast delivery
It's my first experience...let's see

Good experience
"It was a pretty good experience buying from nykaa, but before i ordered a lipstick in a nude shade but it came in a different color than it was showing in the description."
Wonderful experience... On purchaseing my cosmetics on Nykaa
I love shopping on Nykaa. Absolutely the best experience.
good experience
Most authentic product at nykaa ....loved its shopping experience
My experience with this is very nice so far as I am teen I loved the products
"Such worst app. U will vanish soon from this online sectors ... Learn how to handle customer quieries from myntra. Such worst experience returing your product, and i hve gvn that two stars only for your products."
amazing experience
Good experience
Amazing experience always
Several times had good experience. But last time offer section was displaying a lipstick free on lakme orders above 999..but free product was not getting added to cart.Thus there was no way to avail the offer.Tech support claimed it as a technical glitch...which never got fixed until offer lasted
Nice experience
The customer service is just too bad. They do not do the proper follow up and make sure that the product reaches their customers in time. Worst experience. Customers queries and grievances are not attended properly by the support team of Nykaa.
Recently I ordered from Nykaa. I residing at Makardah which is close to Andul(from where the shipment meant to be dispatched) and I didn't experience any heavy rain(as they said they can't dispatch the order from Andul due to heavy rain) I already reported the issue to the consumer forum! The worst part is you're not giving the option to choose 29th September as my preffered delivery date(I don't think it's impossible to deliver the package within one day from Andul to Makardah)
user friendly app with best quality products. i have not experience anything damage or any issue yet.. so go and grab your best dealsüòÑ best app in terms of fast delivery as wellüëç
Best experience ever
Nykaa has given me a amazing experienced it's been 3_4 months I'm using this app and I'm really happy#all product are genuine so guys don't hesitate to buy anything from nykaa##@üòáand thank you so much for your good service and timely response üòá Mr Yash Britto#

bad experience i ordered nykaa mat lipstick nd Lakme enrich lip cryon nykaa lipstick is good but Lakme lip cryon was damage product firstly it was not packed in any box or raping paper and look like an old product not like new one i ignored and then i used it its ok but after 2 or 3 days i rotate the lipstick it doesn't came up and then i called in nykaa helping centre and ask my problem she said now she can't do anything
Till now I have great experience using nykaa
Very good experience with nykaa
Nice first experience
Wonderful experience.. I can trust that the products are genuine. It's not just a app for shopping. But it's a lot more... Must download ... I love nykaa..
There is limited coupons applicable on products & if not the loyalty points are something we use. But for any good or bad reason if the transaction is cancelled or reverted we lose the loyalty points straightaway. Coupons are fine but how do you guys strike off the loyalty points ! Not happy with an experience.
Awesome experience
All Beauty products under one roof is amazing. And with various season discounts going on a wide range of variety to choose from it helps the pocket too. Till now no bad experience. Crossing fingers for it to remain same in future.
"The experience of discovering the beauty with ""NYKAA"" is too good...I love it."
an awesome experience to have makeup products at home
"Product listing is just awesome, have most of the beauty product options available with some great discounts. Only concern is delivery service provider is not professional enough especially WOW EXPRESS, I have very bad experience with them. Delivery time option should be available & delivery person details should be shared with customer for ease of delivery."
Great experience! Will definitely shop again! Had hesitation as it was new to me! Thanks nyka team for good delivery and absolutely new sealed product!
Awsm experience
my experience was good with nykaa...i would recommend to use this for get products on discounts...toatally m happy woth your service....
Nice experience..
Worst experience with nykaa never ever place any order in this app. I have ordered 2 foundations and they send defective ones this is way to do business?? Haigly disappointed and never purchase anything üòë
great experience with good deals......üëçüëçüëç usefull aap......
"Update : I found today that they have so many fake reviews by their own team. Read almost all the reviews of multiple foundations and eye shadows and got to know that.. NEVER USE THIS APP. NEVER PREPAY FOR ORDER. Delivery is slow and that is why I do not use it frequently but this time, experience is way more pathetic. More than one week now and my products are not even shipped.. Customer service is completely useless just the same robotic reply.."
veryy good experience with this app....always give the product without any fault.....so lovely....loving it.....trust able app....‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§

It was a lovely first time experience to shop with Nykaa...
"Awesome experience so far...but the only glitch is that they don't provide 
for cash on delivery on orders below Rs.500....wish they would do something 
for this also as not everyone is willing or has access for online 
payments..."
"amazing experience ‚ù£Ô∏èüëå ,fast shipping loved the products and amazing quality and variety of products so ya its a must having app on your mobile having new launches available"

My experience on Nykaa is wonderful I love this app very muchüòç
"Absolutely pathetic service. Order placed 10 days back but still not received even though I get a message that it is out for delivery since a week. Customer service is useless and everyday they say the same thing that matter had been escalated. Very very disappointing experience. Inspite of sending multiple emails and making calls, nobody seems to bother."
"It's nice to experience new makeup product, so why not nykaa? Its the best online app, i personally believe this app for all makeup products‚ù§Ô∏è Price is bit high, but they are giving the best shades in each n every product for our skin only üíôüíôüëç"

"The shopping experience is great. I'd give it a 5 star if I can get popular asian skincare products like korean CosRx , Japanese hada Labo etc."
very nice experience
this is the worst experience ever not getting notifications not getting calls frm the agent but when i go to track the delivery it shows that the delivery agent can't find me it was supposed to arrive on Sun i checked they said they will deliver it on mon (today) and now when i trackd it down it shows the same.they can't find my address like seriously dude i get all my deliveries to this address only if i could i'd haven't given 1star tooi'd really aprciate if u look to it and deliver it on time
I have ordered 4 items of lifebuoy germ spray of rs 695 but there is no reflection of the above transactions in the app moreover the items came for delivery but subsequently it was returned back by the delivery agency as I have not received any otp from your end please help it's a terrible experience
"Very bad experience! Ordered 2 items from them & the courier is refusing to deliver since past 2 days! Also paid for the order using the courier link but still showing COD! Called both Nykaa & Shadowfax customer service multiple times but they are so lax in their service. It feels like torture attending their phone calls throughout the day. Never gonna order from Nykaa again! Disgusting ,disappointing & unprofessional!!!"
"great products, amazingly handled during shipment, time is well managed by the delivery system ! great experience so far !!!!"
am happy with the range of products and app is superb... nice experience. just love it.... Nobody understands me better than nykaa....
Excellent App n Experience
Its been amazing experience shopping on Nykaa.
Best shopping experience wd nykaa
"Horrible experience didn't expect from nyka for such a unprofessional behavior.Ordered a shampoo on 29th Sep and today it's 21st Nov still its not delivered.firstly I called the help line number for know about the status every time everyone answered yes mam it will be delayed and give us 24 to 48 hours. After 1mnth and 15 days I called and requested for a refund,now on 13th nov they are telling its out from ware house and once you will send it back we will make ur refund where is my refund nyka?"
Always had the bestest experience with Nykaa‚ù§
Good shoping experience with nykka ‚ò∫üíñüíñ
"Pathetic and third class experience with nykaa . Purchased one product which which has return policy, as the product was defective i raised request to return the product but they did not take any action on it. Even after sending reminder emails they are neet even responding."
This Application offers daily deals on Brands which help for better User experience
Very good experience. Happy with the products but sometimes don't get them
My experience is best
Nykaa is an excellent space for beauty and wellness products. The recent payment gateway with BHIM UPI is exceptional. user experience delightful. looking forward to our time together.
Good experience to shop with nykaa
It's an amazing app. It gives amazing offer timely that's what make me like this app more. great experience with nykka
"experience was good,, genuine product's"
Very good app. Using this from last 2 years. Packaging is very good and safe. Great deals. Friendly user interface. One should try nykaa for atleast once.
Vry nyc experience
Its always a good experience to shop in all criteria. Looking forward to purchase more.
"wonderful experience ,,,,lving it"
I am very pleased with my experience with Nykaa. Wide range of products to choose from and on time delivery always . Great app! üëç
wonderful experience
nykka has been a great experience till now... genuine products..... hatts off to nykkaüëç
Nice app that shows the certificate which increases customer confidence unlike Amazon which certified very few choices of product. But I feel it is so clumsy or cluttered with the home page many many options. Wish to see a easy go through homepage interface.
Its a good experience shopping with nykaa.
"I had a very bad experience with this app( poor customer service)I had ordered a charcoal mask and it was damaged when it arrived ,i requested a replacement request right away but they declined. The second time i provided images of the delivery date as well as of the damaged product they accepted my request but it has been 20days and they did not replace it.it seems like a good app but i had a very bad experience and i would recommend people not to use it there is 0 return-replcemnt security."
great experience wd nykaa....
My experience isn't good because I couldn't return the product which was their fault that they delivered without my permission which I never wanted. There's no option for cancellation after shipment and also you can't return the product if size is not appropriate so ultimately you have to keep the product which you don't want. I complained on customer care and yes they replied in a humble way but all in vain when you can't return the items which aren't good.
Amazing experience so far .. love this app üëçüëç
This is my second worst experience of shopping with Nykaa. The first time my order got returned without me canceling my order or returning it and this time also the same thing happened. If you people cant deliver customers orders than whats the need to shop from you. Its better to shop from some other sites or Market. You better change your delivery partners.
I've a good experience with the app....the product sent similar to what shown and with fast delivery.
Nice shopping experience .Would recommend.
"Disgusting experience, thr is nothing called as customer service with Nykaa, u order expensive stuff they send u broken/damaged goods , their chat service will test ur patience by responding twice while u wait for 1 hour , u request return in their app upload photo of broken item n they will reject ur return request with no reason , u mail their support mail Id, they will send u a standard reply when u re- write they wont bother to respond. I strongly discourage any purchase from this fraud site"
"It is an amazing app for beauty shopping. I was absolutely new to this with 
no experience of shopping any beauty products. But this app, has a nice 
interface with easy navigation that lets you browse through many products 
and they give good discounts too"
great experience valuable price for all the products
a user friendly and fun interface!
Worst app. Very bad experience. Don't install it
"been using nykka for quite some time now and i am loving it more every time. best app interface, genuine products and fast delivery. couldn'd ask for more.."
amazing experience with nykaa. It's an amazing aap for beauty products. Have fallen in love with nykaa‚ù§Ô∏è
"Very poor on time delivery,i have ordered something on cash on delivery and i chose this option because i did not want to have a bad experience of my order being delivered on the wrong address as i have experienced it in past. So my current order is not delivered on time although it was just a km away from my address but it was misrouted and it did not delivered on time i don't even know how it is possible and i still don't have my order and its been past 3 days from promised delivery date.üëéüëé"

"worsrt experience and worst customer support, i have to follow up mamy times for wrong and damaged product. its better to buy from Amazon or flilkart rather than using such apps üò†üò†üò†"
"I just love the experience of using this app. The description of all products is apt and to the very last detail correct. Also, I find almost every product related to women's personal hygiene and beauty here and I just love love love it. Also the delivery is so quick and hassle free. A 5 on 5 for sure."

First time i use this app...very nice experience
Nykaa sells expired or nearly expired products I had worst experience twice with Nykaa.. I feel other sites are genuine compared to Nykaa. I have received products that are nearing expiry. I have raised a concern on the app the next day of my order received. Nykaa haven‚Äôt reached me via phone or no updates/notification sent to me via app. And rejected my return request. Cheating support system and they aren't genuine to their customers. Never buy from Nykaa! Worst customer service! Irresponsib
The experience was very good
"Personally, I really like it. Its better than other apps when it comes to beauty products (well obviously) and there are some pretty great offers that are always up. Its a really great app. But then again, I've just recently installed it and I hope I'm not let down. Maybe I'll come back later when I'm more experienced with itüòÇ"
Good experience
"Very bad experience, no return policy, they provide cheap quality product"
great experience with Nykaa love you Nykaa
"Hi , I have been a regular user of Nykaa and have been using your products for so long. As a user i would like to use multiple offers and cashback but unfortunately i dont see multiple payments options on your App and platform. I wanted to use my Airtel Payments cashback and i can‚Äôt see the payment option. This is a bad user experience , you need to have multiple payment options as a facilitator of so many products."
I m shopping on nykaa from past 1 year and the overall experience is good. But I believe there should be more offers.
Great experience
owesome experience
"Whenever I've done shopping with nykaa, my every experience is good."

"very bad experience.. app is too .. tried to order things n it said payment failed so i have retried to place the order.. both times order was placed n i got two orders.. when i requested for return for that extra order, they have rejected.. no way to return them now. coming to products.. lotus day cream is already is used by the time i got it.. only 1/4th of the cream is left in the tube.. lotus lip balm is a disaster.. please don't buy products from them.. they do not accept returns"
I received nice fresh product ......I have nice experience with nykaa thanks.......
The app provides a huge range of variety on beauty products. I assume that the products are not fake. Overall very good experience üëç

"Pathetic! Worst experience of online shopping. My order of 14 products 
wasn't delivered to me. Moreover they don't care about customers enough to 
take the issues seriously and cooperate with customers. Not at all expected 
from a brand like Nykaa! Utterly disappointed."
"I should not even give 1 star to it. Pathetic app ever. They will never take the responsibility for the wrong order Nor will refund you. I will never use it again. I have still not received my product, nor I have received the refund for the wrong product, also have not collected the wrong product. How to trust such apps. Very Very Poor experience. üëéüèª"

"Who have to experience World's worst services?? Okay folk you are at the right place. Nykaa and its service partners provide world's worst services to their customers. Totally disappointed, nykaa have hired world's slowest delivery services (i.e. wow express)."

My experience was good with this app. Delivery on time and product was real..
Great experience...üëç
usless app. worst service bluedart.. never deliver the product.. it always say undelivered area. worst experience..
I had horrible experience with nykaa. First I got few recommendations from their beauty expert and I purchased the product later I asked them to return because their product got me rashes all over my face . How can they sell such product even after tell them I have SENSITIVE skin?? And why do you write you accept return when you actually don't . surely never shopping again
"This is the WORST app ever, they will not help you whatsoever is your problem, offers have hidden Conditions and then they will fool you. Customer support is worst.They won't refund your money,they will not send anybody to pick your order which you placed for refund. The worst experience of my life dealing with such apps is with Nykaa."
superb shopping experience
awesome experience...üòç but please introduce us with some gift coupons..
Best app for beauty products üëçThis app is just amazing!!!! Saying with my personal experience the quality of the products is amazing and there are sooo many offers specially during sale....I really love this app....

"I had purchased few items from Nyka, it's been really a nice experience."
Worst customer care experience ever...no answers what so ever...first time purchase only was miserable...not gonna buy
"Sometimes i felt i got used cosmetics and i try to put it in my review but they didn't posted it n that time i just ignored that but my recent experience with nykaa was very disappointing, i baught clothing items and pair of sandals from them and both of them didn't fit me well so i want to just exchange the size not return but there is no option to exchange in sizes in their site and there is not any option of exchange in their support section of site as well so what the costmer will do."
"Not able to return damaged product, worst experience nykaa. üòî"
If I would be able to give it zero stars I would have done that because I was about to receive my order today so the man called me I was out of station so I said him to wait after that iam unable to contact him worst experience ever worst app ever.. was expecting to ooo much from it but this was a totally nil app hope they'll see n try to get it for me for today
Pathetic customer service experience. Doesn't listen to the issue and give baseless excuses.
Beautiful experience.... fantabulous delivery......... In love with Nykaa üíùüíû

It's been a good experience using nykaaüôÇ
lovely experience
Nykaa is best app for me because l have lost of shopping from this app. Nykaa is good and best app for doing shoping. This app gives best offers on beauty products and delivery experience in nice. If any body want to purchase beauty products so you can purchase nykaa app. But this app doesn't return use beaty products .so you are thinking how should know me because i have experience
"All my orders were returned to warehouse, none of them got delivered to me. Worst experience."
"User experience is amazing, pretty smooth and important thing nyka provide authentication certificate"
loving the experience ‚ù§Ô∏è
Great experience always shopping with nykaa
Good experience
Worst experience ever. Haven't received my order yet. Wrote innumerable mails. Called so many times. No information. Always the same drafted mail that you will get the order and we are looking into it. Will never order from Nykaa again. Such poor customer service. Everyday the app shows failed delivery without taking any effort to deliver.
"I'm very much surprised about this app...bt i add too many products and add the payment method into COD but it did'nt works you guys only sent the prepaid orders i came to know..so sad of you,pls add COD also..very much bad experience"
"Although i didn't received my order, the experience using nykaa is quiet gd."
always Very nice experienced go for it
"My experience was awesome and nykaa has genuine products , delivery on time but a little problem is about their executives .. hope they will improve it"
Amazing experience
Seamless experience.
"At first, I was very skeptical about using an app to buy cosmetics because I had a very bad experience through other e commerce apps. However, after my first few purchases I completely started trusting Nykaa and have so far always enjoyed my shopping experience. Swift Delivery with good packaging. Keep it up Nykaa Team."
Nice experience with Nykaa
It was a great experience shopping from nykaa. And the best thing about nykaa is it authenticity.. Love it..
"Made shopping experience simple, Thank you nykaa‚ô•Ô∏è"

outstanding experience
"Absolutely HORRIBLE!!!! cancellation experience...The App doesn't let you cancel the orders once the product is purchased. You press the cancel button and a lame message comes up ""We sent the request to someone and they will get back to you"". Guess what!!! they never get back :( :( and on top of it Nykaa ships the order after multiple clicks on the CANCEL button (its there just for the sake of it believe me it does not work)... Looks like they don't want to return the money, bought it so you gotta keep it. I have 2 products stuck with them 1. worth 1800 cancelled before shipping 2. Costs 1000 bucks - Refused delivery ""A MONTH BACK"". Tried raising multiple requests with their support but to no avail... Better to go with Myntra or Amazon better service and customer care support, quick refunds (if you cancel before shipping they refund right away)."
"Very user friendly app, makes the shopping experience worthwhile"
wonderful experience .. good and reasonable products .. they really have a variety of stuff .. loved it !
Best experience
wonderful experience
Rates are high but experience is good
"Lovely experience using the app. However, can have a more user friendly interface"
i have placed my first order. enjoyed the experience with all kinds of brands across under one platform
Facing worst experience while returning a product.. its been a week and yet there is no solution provided.
Amazing experience. Quick Quick delivery
I have always a good experience with NYKAA.
"worst, they filter out 1 star reviews on their products.. try giving one star reviews to some product and see for yourself..After having such bad experience from body shop ginger shampoo i posted a review which was never seen in the reviews below, they simply filter out 1 star reviews..they just want products to be sold..good or bad...dont trust the review portion below their products"
The app is good.. my first experience with nykaa was worst.. because I got the wrong product.. but I was 100% satisfied from  my second experience with nykaaüòä
Very pathetic experience.. No proper track update. Customer service doesn't reply anything. I haven't receive my orders still. Now almost more than 15 days.. :(
Such a bad experience with this app i ordered for the first time in which my one product was missing why is this so such a bad expereince . Kindly help me out
overall gud experience. sometimes getting faulty products which is very annoying though i get refund.
awesome experience nice product and delivered within timeü§ó
Good product good experience üòç
"Awsome experience, nd genuine product s on deals"
good experience shopping... pls stop pop up ads in yhe mobile
I have always been going thru tha app...and have ordered quite a few things.. and they were absolutely worth it... great offers...great experience..I love Nykaa!!
Variety of products. High quality. Timely delivery. ‚ù§ 3 years of my Nykaa experience.
"My experience with Nykaa has been fine up until the past two months. App stopped working from two months. It says "" We are facing some internal error. Kindly try again in some time"". I've been in contact with Nykaa support by sending an email in regards to this. I've also followed the instructions given to me about clearing cache and cookies. I've also uninstalled and reinstalled the app numerous times but it's still not working. You guys really need to fix this."
1 star because that is the lowest I can give. Delivery services are pathetic. Order delivery dates are updated by courier partners and then Customer service claims that you requested for a change in delivery date and then the order is returned. No clear communication. They take so much time to deliver that it's better to go and purchase the items from a shop. Uninstall it and save yourself some worries. Not solving any problems. Pathetic experience.
Ultimate shopping experience
awesome experience with Nykaa
Very awsme experience love to order
Gud experience always
Awesome experience
Shopping on Nykaa is a good experience Bt the only problem with nykaa is that they deliver goods in portions . They should try to deliver everything at once.
"Great shopping experience. Have placed numerous orders for almost 21 months now. Fresh products, great discounts, orders delivered on time, orders are always correct and genuine, are nicely nd properly packed. All sizes for every product, are available on this app. Overall, excellent service. Will keep updating my feedback, if required."
lovable experience
Good experienceüëç
"Its really a big cheating, I thought at least nykaa ud give original products and give offers fr costumers, but I personally had a worst experience and products missing, they give expired products on sales by attracting costumers to make money, and ‡≤à have raised a return request yet no response from them, so ppl dont download this and purchase during sales and buy 1 get 1,they send fake products either expired and inside container will b missing, I got a box without d actual product in it, worst"
Wonderful Experience
good experience
The overall experience with the app is very good. My only bad experience is with the orders page.It takes forever to load the page..and after waiting for so long...the screen is just blank with a loader...please look into this..
Overall it's a good experience shopping with Nykaa.. Thank you
It's very good experience with nyka . Fast delivery than I expected üòÉüòÑüòÑ loved it

"had very bad experience with the app. Please only order of you are absolutely sure that you will not need to return the product as they are very very very very much less co-operative with return process. They even just said that they do not take Return Of any product because of the pandemic but nowhere mentioned it. They are just misguiding customers as they do not mention that ""no return will be entertained "" earlier to the customers."
Nice experience so far....all the products were in great shape and quality
Best experience every time
Beautiful shopping experience GREAT
Worst shopping experience nit refunding the money and not taking responsibility for sending damaged products.

My experience with Nykaa is AMAZING...
"Nykaa previously was great. I have ordered number of products, easy interface and great feel. However since past two weeks, I am unable to order anything. Unable to add products in the bag. Nor I am able to order anything from the website. Pls help"
Great experience..but if u put delivery date also it will be even better.

It's always a wonderful experience to shop at Nykaa. The products have been genuine. The delivery has been smooth without any prior hassle.
Amazing experience and it has a very user friendly interface. Kudos to the nykaa team ‚úå
"I am a regular customer of nykaa and make frequent purchases but i am unhappy with the last product i received. The product that i received was of different colour than shown in the pictures. Now, as this product is of no use for me i want to return the product and order for a new one instead. But sadly, am not able to do that as well. I loved nykaa and even recommended to my friends and family. However, i am pretty much disappointed with my last experience. Hoping to hear back from team Nykaa soon! :("
best experience
Very nice experience at nykaa
"Had a great experience in beginning but now the service have become so worst that when u return an order,the return never gets approved n due that the refund does not get initiated in our account,Inspite of sharing the images of damaged product they still call and waste our time to ask wht was the issue with products n to share the pics again to them and then unfortunately your return gets rejected and we customers keep on struggling for the hard earn money.Nykaa should improve the return policy"
"Bad experience on first shopping. Ordered stuff. Was damaged in delivery so it was not delivered to me but it mentioned as 'delivered' in account. After explaining en number of times, i got a reply. 'the items were delivered and as it was cod. We considered it as sold and delivered' ""you can reorder"" . Why i am upset. I had ordered stuff in discounted rates, of which the same is not available on the site anymore. After multiple calls and msgs and tweets and emails. I have given up."
good experience
"Good user interface, and good deals on products"
my experience with this app is not good it's delivery channel is too bad and customer care support is not good
experience is so good
Good experience
"good to shop low price ,simple application, great experience"
Best products...best experience
I don't have words to describe how disgusting the app is. They gave me wrong product and when i complained about it they neither provide me refund nor arranged pick up for the product. Why they have fake customer service why they are fooling us if they can't provide correct resolution to their customers . Such pathetic experience i ever had. I can't describe how much mental trauma they gave to me. I requested so many times but they do nothing. I feel cheated. Such a ridiculous service.
"It's a wonderful experience shopping at Nykaa. Original products. Quick 
delivery and some times the best deals."
Best Experience from nykaa

wonderful experienceüëç
Bestest experience overall...
"its been over a month i have returned the product and still i didnt get my return refund,worst shopping experience ever."
excellent experienceüíû
Nice üòä experience
This app was highly recommended by my friends and family. User-experience is very good. Have already placed an order. Look forward to a long-term association
"I was not present on the day order arrived and they haven't tried to 
deliver the order again. It have been four days since iam trying to talk to 
them on this issue but their is no response They are not even canceling the 
order. Horrible first experience"
Worst Ever Experience with the delivery of my order. The courier partner does a false update of not delivering the order and my order is never delivered. It's been 11 days now
I think this has the worst delivery service till now. I have ordered so many things before from other online shopping sites but this one is just terrible. For one week i was getting calls from the delivery boy that I'll receive my order but at the end of the day I received the message of failed delivery as they could not locate my address. For 7-8 days I had to reschedule my order. I had a very bad experience. I can't say about cash on delivery but prepaid mode is worst.
Had a good experience with this app
"Their Customer Care is pathetic.Had the worst ever experience with their customer care person called Sheetal.She not only disconnected my call in between but was also extremely rude. In addition to this she was not properly infomed and was giving me wrong information. There are plenty of places online and otherwise who have polite, well informed and well trained customer care executives and staff, from where i would be buying the next time onwards. Never again would i buy anything from Nykaa."
Good experience
wonderful experience and awesome delivery totally in love with this app
I ordered oxy bleach n kama rose water ..bleach all spread in box n rose water leaked recieved..i put photos as well but u denies as phoyos not clear whereas i showed it to my friends they will clearely see the fault but u guys not...such a poor experience
Amazing experience with Nykaa in love with Nykaa 's products .
"Amazing experience for the past 2 years. Update: There are great offers on Etude House pore products, but neither is the discount of 10% shown in the cart or the offers when you open the product page. I wanted to buy, but feel like I'm missing out on great offers! Please help! :("
"Worst experience. Ordered on 11th August and still not received my package. 
It has been 6days. Regretting using this. This is the last tym i am using 
nykaa. Worst."

Ordered a jeweller set that was of a cheap quality. Placed a return request on the same dayof dekiveryand it has been 20 days no communication from their end and customer care is absolute useless. Beware of what you order and return policy is a fraud with nykaa. I have given up on my return money. Horrible experience nykaa.

It is a good app n very useful for daily beauty products i just love this app and their quality products i have been spent a good experience with nykaa products and it results good after we use this products..üòòüòä

worst experience!! got expired items
Superb experience with Nykaa.. I just love this app. Everytime I shop with Nykaa I get more excited as there are so many offers everyday and they are so exciting!!! I just love Nykaa
kool and handy for must shopping instantly... love the experience
Ordered items missing. ordered 7 products but only received 5 products. I lost my money. I paid for 7 products. 2 products are missing. And there is no option to get my money back. Worst experience. Pathetic. Worst app.
Good experience
"Great experience but only facing problem with reward points lately.great 
offers coming up on daily basis"
Return and refund policy is pathetic! I have been trying for this from the last 05 days but to no avail. Work on this your return/ refund policy properly or you will loose a large number of customers. I would not like to recommend this aap to others. I ordered five items.The parcel reached on time.I didn't like two of them and thus I tried to return those two items but despite trying to register my request to return nothing could be done and now 05 business days have got over and according to your return policy customers can return/refund the products within 05 business days. Very bad experience!!
"Worst shopping experience with Nykaa.i got a broken lipstick from 
nykaa..though it was sealed i wonder how was it broken from inside.but i 
did not complain nykaa because it was just a matter of few rupees.however 
even the next order i received was damaged.i had ordered face shop 
toner.when i recieved the product it was not in the company packaging. the 
cap of the product was missing because of which the toner had spilled all 
over inside its box.this time i complained and requested a return.i also 
send them email with snapshots of the damaged product.however its been a 
week no one came to pick up the product and they are not even initiating my 
refund even when the problem is from their side.no customer executive is 
doing the follow up of my case.they are least concerned about their 
customer as they have recieved money for the product.never ever going to 
buy anything from nykaa henceforth.such a disappointment you are nkyaa 
team.."
always have a good experience
First two time experience was really very good but last time experience was horrible. Received a totally damaged Lakme Compaq.
"Overall experience is good. However, some of the items seem to be permanently out of stock, which should be addressed."
Good experience...

"Wonderful experience with nyka... Loved the products.. will shop more with

"simple interface, original products, periodic discounts what more do you want"
"very poor customer service Due to very delay in delivery, i was forced to contact customer service, but all the time i have contacted them,they didn't took interest to resolve my issue & not only that they are very irresponsible fellows . so I will not again shop from nykaa due to this bitter experience from customer service. App is gud but you are treated a like a begger by customer care executive.courier tracking is also not working"
Delivery system is not good my experience for my first two orders was good just the delivery person was a little bit unknown about delivery places but in my third order they automatically canceled my order instead of telling correct address to the delivery person and he too confirmed that he understood and he is coming but suddenly I got a call telling my order could not be delivered due to not telling the correct address then I had to request again for delivery
Best experience good quality and deals.
"really had a great experience with nykaa, loved it"

Had a worse experience. Bought a Shosha product which did not appeal me . Nobody was interested to help in its return as the relevant option was not available to me. Totally dissatisfied with the return policy of Nykaa.
good experience
It was a good experience....but the only drawback is cash on delivery option is not available below 500
Love the experience with
Awesome online shopping experience with good discounted products!
Best shopping experience! Genuine products. Kudos nykaa teamüëç

Great and First Experience
At that moment it was very good experience ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòäüòä
My worst experience ever..i placed order via google pay and my money was deducted twice from my account.this really hampers down your image nd worst thing is no customer executive was dr to resolve my concern..greatt
"the app is worth nothing, had the worst experience shopping on this app.....they delivered a different product than what i ordered and even denied to replace or return it. i chose a product with some special specifications needed for myself. they delivered a different product and didnot even replace it, let alone returning.... cheat people"
Just loved the app I've had zero complaints there's not a single prblm in this app it's easy to use and overall my experience with nykaa was amazing I rate this 5 stars
Fast delivery. Good packaging. Trusted products. Great experience !
Good experience
"Awesome, user friendly interface. Quick ordered and got 1st time order discount and shipping free. Happy"
lovely products üëå great experience
"amazing,winderful experience n wonderful products too .. i even stopped going to store to get my items as i feel nykka products r vry much good n upto our choice.. really luved it"
very bad service. 0 problem solving mechanism. late processing... cancellation and return are full of confusion. you really need to work on streamlining the purchase experience... looks like nykaa is focusing more on its inhouse products than the digital platform through which they gained their customer base...
"Worst experience to shop with Nyaaka. Even the courier partners are of no use, lack of communication. Just a waste of time to shop with you. I have placed my order on 19th Oct and no one bother to deliver it. Even your courier guys don't try to make a call. After so many complaints no one responded. Pathetic app won't recommend anyone"
Best experience ever
till now my experience is awesome delivery is always on time product is genuine .....
"LOVE IT! All my skin and body care products under a single roof. Superb 
variety and brilliant interface."
good experience as a first time user
I want to share a experience with this app this app is horrible and very poor with customer service I didn't expect this Amazon and flipcart are the best platform to buy such cosmetic products
"I had ordered biotique coconut and skin whitening cream and it got 
cancelled from bluedart as I got the message and the payment was done 
through net banking so either you deliver the item or send my money back 
....it was my first order I didn't know the service is like this....very 
bad experience."
fabulous experience with nykaa products
Very bad experience ...mje mera parcel delivered hi nh hua ...or payment mode bh online tha...fake delivery show krdi with fake signature...worst online app...mje mera payment refund kro....fake app
Very happy with Nykaa . Till date have had very good experience
Nice and hassle free user experience
Excellent product Awesome experience
Great Experience
I have purchased products and returned. The refund was initiated on 22nd November. It has been almost a month already and Everytime I talk to their customer support they are asking me to wait for 5 more days. I have sent a mail for the support and they aren't responding too. This has been the worst experience I have had from any online stores. Nykaa don't claim yourself as best when you take a month to solve your customer issues!!! Ridiculous!!!!
Wonderful and amazing experience
Gud experience
Hasselfree experience genuine products in short delivery time
I had wonderful experience
Wonderful experience

I can't stop shopping@Nykaa... just loved d experience... # genuine products# safe packaging# good service... !! highly recommended app...!!
Very poor..very bad..This app is disgusting...i have a very bad experience for shopping on nykaa..it can't return your product in time...it wasted too much time and money of mine by not returning and refunding for the damaged product ...I suggest you to not use this app as it can deliver your product in time but it can't return the damaged or wrong product provided by the app... It doesn't return and refund..
Overall experience very great!
I have received my 1st order packed with cough (sputum). Very nasty experience.ü§ß
Best shopping experience ever... This app has great discount going on always Genuine products Loved it.üíó
I wish there could be a zero rating. Such a bad experience with this cheater. Places a prepaid order but my products did not get delivered yet. And they are not refunding also. And the customer care executive does not have any information. Seems like need to put consumer case. You guys suck as your service. Cheater do not have money to put it through their mouth so taking customers money
Experience has been great so far. Trustable and worthy. Thanksss Nykaa..‚ò∫Ô∏è
Yet today I have experienced a good quality of products those are genuinely working. Wide range variety
So far my experience with nyka was really good...and i hope that it continues to provide such services in the future as well
Lovely experience
Great shopping experience
I had placed an order on Jan 18 And till now delivery has not been done and I have prepaid it. they are not cancelling my order and initiating refund. Not expected this from NYKAA. worst experience.
Had a good experience until this pink friday sale where all the items that i ordered with COD payment option were never delivered and then automatically cancelled. When i mailed them regarding this issue there was no response from their side. Dissatisfied and disappointed.
Easy to use.. Trust worth experience
"Great experience while ordering the Hot pink sale ü•∞ , eagerly waiting for my order now üòçüòç"
Good experience always
"Super experience as always üôÇ,,,"
Awesome experience with nykaa
"I used to love nykaa. They had very prompt services. but recently since it became famous, their services has deteriorated. This app gave me the worst experience. For the first time i was not able to receive my refund. They apparently initiated the refund but it has heen 15days and I have not received it. Their customer service is pathetic. They'll only ask you to wait and wont provide with any solutions. worst app."
Amazing experience üëç
Good experience
Worst experience ever pathetic service
great experience... i love all the products bought from nykaa
nice experience
Great ordering experience. Waiting to check the product quality once delivered
Excellent experience Loved it
Wonderful experience
"Horrible experience with the return policies of nykaa. Received a damaged product and haven't received any invoice copy inside the delivery box as well as Nykaa not providing any link to download the soft copy of invoice. When I talk to the customer service I was asked to mail on support@nykaa. As I do so they keep asking for the invoice haven't send me any confirmation mail of refund. As a constant buyer of nykaa didn't expect this,as return process is very clumsy think twice before you order."
Always a good experience
good amazing üòç experience for nayka online shopping good product
Very poor experience. I was a regular customer until my last order. Wrong products were delivered and so I initiated a return request. My request was denied for no reason and even after continuous complaints to the support team and presenting several pictures of the products no corrective action was taken. They just kept on bugging and asking for pictures atleast 4-5 times and that too in vain. Highly disappointed with the support teams conduct.
Good experience..
"Wonderful experience, really excited with the products available & also coupons helps a lot with amazing discount üëç loved it"
Awesome experience .. Love it
"Team nykaa, please change Wow Express as your delivery partner. Such a worst experience. They always send back my products saying consignee not available not even contacting me. I never had such an experience with your other courier partners. Please consider this as a request."
My experience is really very bad this app...i had bought some products but when i received the products ..all products was broken
Bahot bura experience hai mera 1st order hai or abtak mujhe mila nhi .üò†
"I'm horribly dissatisfied with your customer service. I have sent infinite emails, called your service number so many times and yet my issue isn't solved. If you can't even solve a customer's problem, then there is no point of all the Hot Pink sales that you organise. The worst online shopping experience ever! How long do you expect a person to be patient?! If you can't deliver an order in the quantity that a customer orders, at least you can provide a refund or pay attention to the problem."
My experience is excellent
Good experience ‚ò∫Ô∏è all things r original
Always a good experience of purchasing cosmatics from Nykaa. I like to read the blogs too.
good experience
Very bad experience I have place my order on 31st march till now i dont have my order so i have cancelled my order but i don't have my refund very cheap products

My experience is very bad... I have order 6 things on Saturday still not received... Delivery boy is also very rude. Very bad experience
"Worst experience ever, I ordered fit me foundation, they delivered expired material and not ready to take it back, don't fool people"

Very good experience

"Costly products, I would say. Amazon is far better than this. If you haven't experienced Amazon, your life is a lie."
V. Nice happy with this app it's v good for makeup n everything in the makeup n about ladies there is everything with good price I experienced to first time n happy with it...üëçü§ó
"Nykaa has been an amazing experience. The packaging, the products and the delivery, everything is worth every penny spent."
All in all great app which gives you great shopping experience .
Experience with nykaa was beautiful
"Worst experience. In this lockdown flipkart, Amazon, myntra is doing great work but this app is only trying to fool people.no one is replying my email and order is not delivered."
"Very worst incase of delivering products..I have ordered my product on 20th june..still I didn't receive my product.Its been more than a week..very very worst experience on my 1st order on nykaa.It is asking to reschedule..but never had a plan to deliver products I think...I felt very bad to waiting for my product which I've paid already..If u can't deliver product on door step means,don't flash ur products to order online..."
Experience is good till now.
Good experience till now
Good experience
It is very useful app. I m loving it. I have ordered many things from nykaa. service is very fast. overall good experience.
Experience has good so far.. It's just at times they goof up in terms of delivery
"I ordered my things (3 items) on Saturday, its Wednesday now and there is no information of my order. Its showing in transit from last 3 days. I tried to chat but it was of no use as it's an automated reply and doesn't give us option to explain our concern. No support or info provided. If any order is late its required to mention the expected delivery time. This is my first time experience and I am feeling highly disappointed."
"Pathetic experience for a first time customer. Ordered prepaid, No credibility of delivery. Pathetic delivery partner with wrong updates on the app. Delivery in Bangalore city. Still no sign of delivery. On manual chat support, they address you with ""ma'am"", even when I made it clear that I'm a man. So they they assume that all customers are women? Can't customers be men who are brothers buying from here for their sisters? I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP, RATHER GO TO AMAZON TO BUY."
love u nykaa.... had a great experience. thank you for your timely services. love to order again and again from you....
Worst app and their services... I have ordered about two weeks ago but still not have received it... When u submit your order they will msg u tgat within 2 working days.. The items will get delivered but such poot service i am facing for thrice the times..  Uninstalling this worst app i have ever experienced
Amazing Experience.. Amazing Products..! Big Fan of NYKAA
"Worst experience.. don't know why my products were undelivered twice.half of the order have been delivered and half remained undelivered forever..have been shopping at nykaa from ages,but dis was unexpected and totally unappreciative."
I have been using Nykaa for around 6 months now. Products are just fine . Delivery is also ok . There are a few glitches here and there but they have successfully made amends for them so far . These things happen with online retailers. I think if given the chance Naykaa will provided better experience to customers. Kudos !!!  P.S. work on making your app more efficient on the system side. It slows down my phone a little bit.
Amazing experience..fast payment fast service :)
One of the worst experience I have ever.... I have ordered L'Oreal shampoo... They send fake product... After wash my hair.. Hair is still dirty.... I have send so many mail and complain.. Till date they didn't take any action even not accept return process
awesome experience with great discount
Supar app my best experience in naykaaüòçüòçüòç‚ù§Ô∏è

Awesome experience
I ordered some items and the nykaa team cancelled it.i ordered more than 5 times .bad experience.
wonderful experience with Nykaa
"Bad experience.. This app only shows good comments, whereas this is very bad. They show good comments so that people buy them. Negative comments should also be shown so that people think and buy before taking anything."
amazing experience ‚ù§
"I buy plum products its awsum experience,üëç"
Great interface and on time delivery
Experience has been good so far..products are authentic..packaging is extremely professional
great experience
My experience shopping with nykaa is very nice. They deliver the products on time and the products are the genuine ones no compromise with quality.
My best experience in buying beauty products and a trusted shopping site .
"Worst Experience! What happened to you guys, It became work after the recent update.It freezes after every 3 min.It used to be good.But now it is a terrible experience. Nykaa team please look into it !"
my experience with nykaa is so magical.
I'm using nykaa more than 3 years...i have an amazing experience...i will recommend to eveyone to try atleast once
"Almost all quality products available at nykaa at good discount prices, fast delivery...... Great experience shopping with nykaa."
"The best!!! Absolutely love it!! They have absolutely everything from make up to skincare products!! Been using this app for 2 years now, I was never disappointed!!! Amazing interface, great service and availability of every single product!! Just love it!!! ‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫"

Best shopping experience @Nykaa always..üíïüíï
Best app....Loved every shopping experience..
"Horrible experience ever, items were missing from my package, and when I tried to contact the help centre no one helped, they just didn't reply at all. Absolutely waste of money"
It's always a great experience to shopping with you ...nyka never disappoints me . thanks you nykaüòá
I had good experience with nykaa
"Worst experience... Can't see my orders or even cancel it... Fraud, if you even cancel your order then they still force you by calling you several times... Worst experience... The app crash several times"
Very good App and great experience exploring and comparing products. They provide genuine products.
amazing experience with nykaa... I always buy my cosmetics from nykaa. It has never failed meüíì
"good experience. I was searching for pocket perfumes, I got it. Thanks"
"I never expect it from nykaa..I got a notification from nykaa that if I purchase above 1400 from kama Ayurveda , I will get a pouch and 4 delux sample. After purchasing two items my bill value was above 1500..still I didn't get neither pouch or any sample.when I called to customer support they told only if stock available they can give otherwise not.now what is this support? I faced this issue before also.really poor experience before Diwali."
Wonderful experience with Nykaa everytime
Highly disappointed with the return policy....product are very different from the pictures shown in the site...First experience very bad experience üòî
Best experience
experience untill now has been beautiful and satisfying üëçüòá..
Excellent experience
Beautiful experience
Love the experience! ‚ù§üåπü§ó
"Really bad experience. They first discount the product and then ship you an expired product. So if you shop from them, you are basically paying for an expired product. Beware."
Nice experience with this application
very nice experience with Nykaa
Great shopping experience...
App interface is awesome. Wide range of products available unlike many other beauty apps.
"A very bad experience, I had placed an order, Nd from past 4 days it's 
continuously showing failed to delivered.... I need to cancel my order, nd 
it's nt evn showing a proper thing tht my order is canceled or nt, evn 
though I hd txt to nykaasupport as well, bt they are also nt showing a good 
response, what is this..? This is how you will deal with your future 
upcoming customers, Nd yes it's my frst order from nykaa, on frst order 
only this kind of rubbish."
The application UI is user-friendly and easy to navigate through the products and different brand sections. Nykaa offers a range of comestic products.. few of which are not even available on other online shopping sites. I'm a Prive member and a very old user of Nykaa and my overall experience with the app is great. Love the experience! ‚ù§Ô∏è
"lovely experience, great deals and genuine products. The app / website has all relevant details to help choose the product matching one's requirements."
Very bad experience. Not received order on time. late delivery. Highly disappointed
Wonderful experience I found two my products damage and with two days I received my money back without any call without any follows thank u nykaa
"Your blue dart courier service is not good some times simply they send the 
message that customers are not available .i have very bad experience about 
this before iam getting the product in 3 to 4 days now its taking at least 
1 week"
Great shopping experience from nykaa
"This was my first time experience with Nykaa and I can't explain the bitter 
consequences I had to deal with.Had so much of patience but Nykaa tested 
it.I placed an order on 4th of June didn't receive the order on the 
expected date that was on 6 to 9th of June.It came on 14th of June but I 
couldn't receive due to some inconveniences.The delivery man was very rude 
and didn't came up with my order again instead he blocked my number when I 
tried to contact him.The Nykaa team promised me to deliver the product 
within 24hrs but that's the same response I received after waiting for 
another 24hrs. Their service is very poor.Very much disappointed by this.I 
am gonna uninstall it now. I am very offended and sad."
awsome experience with nykaa..great offers with fastest delivery üñí
Good experience with nykaaüòäüòä
its being nice experience i am completly satisfied with quality of product and delivery customs except that the delivery should be done according to availability access of recipient
Very satisfied experience
"Worst shopping experience. Nykaa has cancelled my 3 recent orders , without any information/mail/text msg, whereas we keep on getting the useless and frustrating notification now and then. On contacting the customer care, 1st of all, they disconnect with 2 mins (on purpose), and then everytime we hear a different customer care executive who again repeats the same thing that it's happening due to pandemic that they can't ship to my place, on the other hand m getting parcels frm all sites."
"Nykaa is a great app, I tried to order few products in Amazon it is charging me extra . But in Nykaa they will not charge extra and will give us really genuine products , till now I never faced a bad experience with Nykaa. In love with Nykaa ‚ù£Ô∏è. Thanks Nykaa."
Good experience
"I've had the worst experience with this app. Their return policy is terrible. First they didn't approve my refund request, and i had to write a mail to their team, it got approved somehow. Now it says your refund duration is over."
It's great experience with nykaa.. loved it
great experience with nykaa..
AmaZing experience till date..
Good experience.
"once you pay for it,, they deliver it too late, I order it 10 days before and not received it yet very bad experience"
awesome app for shopping. Great deals and genuine products. Just go for itüòäüòä Every time a new experience with happiness
Vry good experience
"Worst delivery experience. Everytime the delivery date of prepaid order keeps on rescheduling on its own. I don't receive a call from the delivery guy. The only call i receive is ""we got to know from our delivery boy that you have rescheduled your delivery."""
I had really bad delivery experience with nyaka it's really very irritating
Good experience
So far so good experience with products and delivery üôÇ
"They said i will recieve my order within 6 days but the order has not 
arrived yet after 15 days.i recieved a call from delivery boy he said he 
will be at my place within an hour but i wait so long still i didnot get my 
order.i wrote u guys many times but u are not doing anything. Wrost 
experience."
"This is the fakeside I order ""wicke brown"" and the are send a ""fake Brown 
treat"" Please dont by anything in this side.. Its vry bad experience.."
such a very good quality products. love u Nykaa‚ù§.my experience is good overall üòäüëç
superb experience
Lovely experience everytime.
"lovely app, amazing experience"
very good experience with you guys......
Very nice experience.good
The worst and pathetic experience.. firstly they lie that receiver was not at home soo they returned the delivery..after 2 hour the msg came for another parcel frm same nyka that they have delivered the product.. delivery boy not even called me once. What a pathetic service sir.
Great user experience
"I have been a Nykaa customer for a really long time now, and am a prive user. Though as it turns out, the quality of products provided is degrading as each day passes. The sole reason of ordering from Nykaa was the fact that it was reliable enough. One could blindly trust that the product ordered will always be genuine. But lately I have been receiving duplicate products from Nykaa, which is a really big disappointment. The same is the experience for certain other people around me too!"
nice experience
I never had a bad experience with Nykaa.. absolutely love it.
Even after online payment my order not placed and items still showing in the cart ..but my money deducted ...worst experience with nykaa ...
This app gives the best shopping experience.
brilliant experience of shopping on nykaa...loving it
Amazing products delivery on time about delivery we get all the updates so no need to worry lovely experience keep it up guys üëçüëçüòçüòç
"With the experience of last 6 to 7 years..always delivery on time,best and original products Thanks for your service in this crucial period when we cannot go outside for shopping the personal items."
I ordered 13th June.till..my order not deliver at my address.3rd class courier partner (wow courier). wrost experience ever. üò°üò°üò°Nykaa plz provide Delivery agent contact number for better communication. Your Ex courier partner Blue Dart is the best üëç.
Very nyce experience with nyka
It was a good experience shopping in Nykaa
"had a very bad experience with naykaa. i ordered a lip liner which was completely empty from inside, i called on customer service but they didn't answer me properly."

Great online shopping experience

The overall experience of shopping here is good. Please make the process to return of the product more easier instead of creating a request or chat request.

"My experience is good with nyka.. variety of range.. many times get products at discounted prices..I am very happy..love nyka.original products, timely delivery..‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"

Even price are so high if u want to buy some products check to othet websites you can get products with good price and quality was grt. very bad ...."
Nyc experience..
Great experience...
Nice experience ....
Great shopping experience & quick deliveries. I highly recommend to have wonderful buying on line.
My experience with nykaa has always been amazing. üòä
Bad experience with last order. my order cancelled because of covid19. But they don't refund my money back.
I had a very good experience with nykaa...The products delivered are same as I viewed and those were amazing...Keep up Nykaa.üëç
Worst site ever!! I ordered few things for mothers day 4 days back n every day I've been checking the delivery status n it says confirmed but not ready to dispatch yet.. And today I had to call the customer service to ask what the current status n they were like ma'am it's ready but we won't be able to deliver it before or on mother's day! First thing they don't clearly mention the delivery dates n then they r fooling us. By the way thanks nykaa for the first n last experience. My friends n I have deleted the app already! Won't recommend it to anyone! Thanks for spoiling my surprise for my mother!
good experience
"Horrible experience with Nykaa.. bought a bra which is not fitting me properly. Called there customer care multiple time, mailed them and satisfed their need by sending multiple pictures. And not they say we won't take a return because you wore.. I don't understand without trying how can someone find out whether it will fit or not. Unbelievable.. horrible experience."
"I really do love this app! Almost everything I want is on this and I've come across so many new brands through this, that I otherwise wouldn't have heard of. I still wish there were some products and brands that were available on this. That would make my shopping experience even more rewarding and easier. But for now what they have is amazing! It's been almost 2-3 yrs since I've been ordering from here. I've stopped shopping for cosmetics outside. :)"
it was awesome experience at the time of purchase...
"Worst experience while returing a product they dont lift our calls and they wont reply to our emails, i didnt got my refund, never trust nykaa"
Simply loving the shopping experience in Nykaa.!!
Liked the interface and service
nayka great experience.... all products are original and delivery is on time.... I loved it ‚ù§üòò
AWESOME experience.. QUALITY products are delivered by NYKAAüíù
It was a nice experience to shop with nykaa..

Gud experience with Nykaa.The best thing with this app is easy to accesss loved it.
"Awesome experience ...orignal products...on time delivery .....overall a big fan of nykaa...Nykaa makes me Nykaa. (means heroein, actress in bengali) it makes me fell that ....love urslef ....."
Worst experience of my friend. One of the employee from the account department of this company try to scam and tried to flirt with my friend. They misuse the personal details of the customer.
great experience..
NYC experience...
Very good experience with this app. It provides wide range of products üëçüëç
Perfect online shopping experience ‚ù§Ô∏è
"gr8 experience,gr8 products"
very amazing experience with genuine products üòç
"The app works just fine and the interface is quite good but every product describes Easy return policy which is a big time lie. Nykaa doesn't want offer any easy return, everytime you have to write an email request with the order number and then a picture of the product intact just to confirm the return process. After the verification of pictures the return request is accepted. Nothing such is mentioned below the product."
Best shopping experience !
Great experience shopping with Nykaa. Prompt delivery and good customer service
"Main thing here is no delivery below 400...no cash on delivery below 800 ,Worst app ever, in delivery not possible area ,they shouldn't accept the order,but they accept,and made us to pay and then saying ur order cancelled....but they didn't give further details.....they shouldn't inform about refund status......worst experience....hate u nykaa"
its an amazing experience with nykaa but expecting a bit of discount
It makes easy and quick delievery of product .... nice experience of shopping here....hope for better service ahead.üòç
It has lots of brands and products .my experience till now üòäüòä
need a new user interface(app).
"This is very annoying app ,once i downloaded it ,then wen i need to delete this app , it has started appearing continuously on my phn for download.......buyers be careful while downloading such kinda app.......i had a very bad experience with dis app....stop disturbing me"
"Amazing app. I've ordered so many makeup products from this app, the products are genuine and also the delivery is on time. I have been using this app from past 3 years and the experience has been lovely."
In my whole life I ordered first time from this app now in my 30s nd really very worst experience. Am v disappointed literally. The order was really important to me n v special but it ruined it totally
Waste and worst experience from this app
Need to experience d products...... Surely will give a gud feedback after using d products
I have awesome experience of purchasing on nykaa. All products are authentic and price is reasonable as well.
"I ordered for the first time from Nykaa and received a delivery text on 22/09/19 at 3 pm that the order is out of delivery. However nobody from delivery team contacted and at 8:35 I received another text informing the delivery failed. So, I tried to reach the support option in Nykaa which is another pain because there is no actual person whom you are speaking with rather it is a chat bot kind off and no matter what you select you keep going in circles. This an incorrigible experience."
"Bad experience, they will send you whatever they want to...and then there is no customer care call u can talk with...and they have no return policy for electric appliances ...if any case u ordered 2 product same or they send u defective...."
Worst experience I hate this app service you guys need to get good delivery process my products are not delivered it sucks
Good range of products and good discounts make for a fun shopping experience . Love Nykaa! ‚ù§
The Best Shopping experience
Awesome experience
Good experience with app.
"Very bad customer experience. They dont even care of your customer. When you reach to the customer care, the employees who pick the call they disconnect the call with out even giving proper information."
Very nice experience...
I really love nyakaa shopping app. It's has everything beauty and fashion related. Very good experience as well.
Worst experience I have ever had on an online shopping site. O costumer satisfaction. Neither delivering the product nor giving any option to cancel it. My product has been at the same place since 27th May and not delivered till now. Please guys don't use this app. Its the worst
This is my first experience.I just hope everything is good.
Mind blowing experience n best quality ever in all product may gives u lots of blessing in ur all deserve success wht u achievement n I hopefully buy each and everything easy in best price
"I appreciate the excellent service you provided,your attention to detail,great communication skills made the experience even better than i expected"
Always a good experience. one suggestion to keep the stock updated
"Yes, lovely experience and fast delivery.. :-)"
It's a great experience shopping with Nykaa
I had great experience üòä....
great experience with Nyks
"I am having amazing experience with Nykaa, visual interface plus shopping. I am completely satisfied with the available products and customer service. Also shopping from Nykaa is always economical. A big thanks and ‚ù§Ô∏è to Nykaa. I just love Nykaa."
"App is very nice, but delivery service is very very very worst. Getting ""your order is out for delivery"" message daily from past 7 days where i haven't received single call from delivery executive. Till now i have not received parcel and when i tried to call customer service they will always say ""you will receive it soon madam"" but won't receive anymore. Don't do any marketing/advertising that much if you have poor service. Worst online purchase experience everrrr.üôÑüôÑüôÑ"
good experience üëç
having nice experience...
i got a vry gud experience wth thm.. yes thy do not give uh a huge discount bt tht was actly quite gud!! lovedisapp
Good experience
gud experience
I used it first tym and it was my best experience. Now I'm continue with this app
Not good experience
It's a good shopping experience to shop with Nyka. Hope new offers will come soon
wondrrful experience ‚ò∫
My experience with Nykaa has always been good. Prompt delivery and well packaged products are something that is always taken care of. The offers are also attractive. Thank you!
Worst customer care service I have ever experienced. Their executives didn't have any knowledge of their own policies. Executives says delivery charges are refundable and when they refund they donot refund the delivery and say it is not in our policy to refund the delivery. This is my worst experience on nykaa. They are not ready to accept their mistake. Never pay in advance on nykaa always select cod if you donot want to loose money.
Great app! Easy to use ! Amazing deals! Easy check out ! Swift deliveries! Excellent customer care! Great delivery experience!
Very bad. No customer service at all. It had delayed my order for over two weeks. And still no reply from their end. Cannot cancel once it has been shipped. Very bad experience
I love the experience so far
The best online shopping site for beauty and skin care products it has lot of brands and products in my area there is no shop that hasn't have much of verities and it is trust worthy i have never had a bad experience in nykaa love you nykaa
"I didn't get my order delivered even 3-4 days later than the ""promised date"". I contacted the support for like three days, all I got in response was ""there are some issues with the delivery"" and ""delivery service isn't there at the address you provided"". I've never had this problem before with the delivery with any other e-com platform. The products are nice at great prices, but what's the poimt if it doesn't get delivered? My first experience with Nykaa and I'm not looking forward for more."
Osm experience shopping with nykaa..loved it üíñ
Superb experience ....love it and I'm the customer since so many yrs..love u nykaa ü•∞ü•∞
I have a very good experience with nykaa... I am very impressed and it is very helpful..
it's awesome app I'm totally loving it great experience with nayka fast delivery
amazing collection and customer friendly interfaceüòä
"I had the worst experience with my 1st order, it never reached to me, without any notice returned back, plus the chat option are the terrible one not at all useful, by sending automated message will not resolve the issue."
Very very nice experience
Was reluctant initially to order but you guys were awesome and the delivery was flawless and without any hiccup. The app experience was also good. Plus she liked it ! Thanks nykaa team.
Amazing experience..loved it
Worst experience ever on an online shopping I placed an order on 30th of January 2021 and today 12 days after that neither me nor Nyka people have an idea about where my order has gone.. I call their customer care every other day and they give me different info on every call.i still din receive my order or my refund..
Worst app. Doen't return my money. I cancel my order but they dnt return my money. Customer care person doent listen. I am very dissappoint. I will complaining against nykaa if they do not return my money. Bad experience. Hate nykaa app.
"I feel nykaa has got it's hype for no reasons. I recently purchased one of my orders for a friend which I cancelled because of delay. And they didn't refund my reward points worth rs. 48.So for me, nykaa is not a trust worthy one and won't offer you a good customer experience always. They will not return your money back to you just because yoh cancelled it! And those reward points were collected by me for quite a long time-4837 points. Really disgusting one I must say. And I am really saddened."
"Very Good and simple App with no confusion for end user, simple and effective User interface, Well done App development team"
Great experience
My previous experience has been good but not recent. Nykaa couldn't help me with the nykaa store purchases neither could the nykaa store employees help me. All of the nykaa executives are unaware of any help to be provided for store related issues.
The delivery system is pathetic. The courier guy never called and the order got cancelled by itself. Thanx for the experience btw
NYC experience over here
waiting for delivery of my order But good window shopping experience coz contains a large variety of products...
Nice experience. Love this site.
nice experience!
Recently I have received a damaged item...very bad experience with nykaa.üò†üò†üò†
Worst experience..at first they took my order and made me wait 1 month and then at the end cancelled my order..very disappointed..never gonna order from nykaa..
GREAT USER INTERFACE AND AMAZING SHOPPING EXPERIENCE! VERY GLADDDDDüòä
Interface is good... But I couldn't avail the first time purchase offer of 500 rs off... This is not done
Nykaa's app provides a fuss free shopping experience and the products are of great quality too. Love it ‚ù§
The app is very useless & non corporation service they has. This app is not shipping & deliver order at the time. And if any one talks with there customer care executive those people not replying well and make fun. I think there is so many app besides nykaa for cosmetics & many more thing. My experience is really bad with nykaa l.
Lovely experience shopping with nyka
Pathetic experience! I never canceled my order and infact confirmed the order with customer service and you without any confirmation go ahead and cancel the order!
"I had a really bad experience using this app ...I ordered an item and it was not delivered ... I have been trying to contact the customer service for over a month but they said my issue is being closed and they can't help me, there was no refund and I also lost the money"
Unavailablity of many products! But overall experience is good! Products are well packed and delivered on time even in pandemic situation ‚ù§Ô∏è
"It's a great shopping aaps ever i have experience, nice product with nice delivered service."
Worst experience ever.  I ordered maybline foundation and concealer. I received damaged bottle of foundation which was expired too  and i want to return it but return process is very poor. I want refund. I recommend never shop with nykaa
"My experience was HORRIFYING. I ordered something. Got another version of 
the product (paid for 400 ml got a bottle of 250 ml.) I returned it. 
Thankfully theey sent the man to take it back the very next day. But then, 
now i am mailing and calling them but they're replying. Its as if they have 
eaten up my money or something. Vvv disappointed."
Great products and pretty reliable reviews. I've always been apprehensive about buying skin care and beauty products online but my experience with Nykaa so far has been pretty good. And of course they have quite a few brown girl friendly brands which is a big plus for me.
it is awesome how nykaa has made life much more easier for girls like us who don't have time to move out for shopping due to busy schedule.....i personally love the experience just that once they took around 2 days to deliver my order...earlier they used to do it in a day....üòá
Excellent experience
It's always a good experience using nykaa... Great offers and deals to caputure authentic products... Love it ‚ù§Ô∏è
good experience
Bad experience. They don't have return option
i am in love with nykaa... amazing platform for authentic products with very nice delivery services nd customer support... till now i had great experience with nykaa
Very Amazing experience

gud experience every time
Very bad customer service. They can't even change the mobile number. They simply tell that they will look into the problem and nothing they do. Products are not genuine products. Worst experience with this aap. So requesting every one not to use this aap.
"Love to shopping with nykaa..I Always had good experience with nykaa never disappoint me team nykaa, Delivery of products too fast with in 3 days ..packaging also too good..thankew nykaa..ü§©glad to shopping with you.."

nyc...first experience ...really like it
my experience with nykaa is fantastic.. so far i bought got good products.. 1thing i must appreciate is the delivery timing .. i would recommend it others to buy from this site..
Awesome experience.love shopping..
Worst app for shopping..They will never deliver your stuff if you will pay them in advance.. They have no proper customer care.No one will reply.You will just loose your money..I have uninstalled it after loosing my money.Pathetic experience.
"Always a satisfying experience, every single order I make.keep it up!"
Great experience..
Overall very good experience!!
While the interface and user experience is fine they keep sending spam content about sales every few minutes. Till date have faced issues with orders - Either payment does not go through or if it goes through then they take your money but do not dispatch your product. The custimer experience is non existent. Once in 10 tries they answer a chat and say high demand during continous sale i will check and dispatch your order. And 1 week later no change in order status. Worst experience ever!
Today I got delivered my items and after the delivery I'm getting the call whether I have made the payment or not..No one will leave the items in front of my door for free..Didn't expected this..worst experience ever.
"**Updating to respond Nykaa's typical reply** I have already wrote it to you guys, no response received.. worst app experience ever. I have always been shopaholic and do it online all the time.. Other apps such easy returns like Myntra, Shein.. I had ordered 6 items out of which I wanted to return 2 but they rejected the return and that too without giving any reason. No customer care number available, mailed them and no response received. I strongly recommend not to buy anything from Nykaa."
"Absolutely loving the experience of shopping at nykaa...the most essential is being able to buy products that are not available properly in indian market. Thank you for making our shopping simple, safe and worthy."
my experience with nykaa is really beautiful‚ù§ i just love this appüòç
"They have good offers and wide ranges of products in the bag fit to my requirements regarding all cosmetics and skin, hair and body care products with various brands and sizes. Till now good experience."
very good experience
Great experience

"Great availability and delivery experience. The points system can be better. It does not really benefit loyal long-standing customers. But products range, quick delivery and user engagement drive me to this app repeatedly for my skin care and cosmetic needs."
"awesome experience with nykaa trust able Shopping app ever..,thnkiewww so much nyka for alll good product"
I love this app because it's very amazing experience üòçüòç and also it's easy to use the appüòäüòä Regrad Princess Syeda üôÇ
love the shopping experience with this app.
great experience !üíï
i have had good experience so far...recieved genuine products so all good
"Try to return an item and you will know the process and the response. Worst  experience. There is no update till now for the return, there is no contact no. provided nor i got any response from the team."
I like nyka products very much.i buy three lipsticks first time.this is the good experience for me
Wow experience

I always have an amazing experience with nykaa
My experience with Nykaa is amazing...
"It's a very good experience purchasing things from nykaa, safe delivery..and..I trust Nykaa for its originality of the products."
App is ok but worst return process. I purchased few earrings and one i didnt like and want to return it and came to know that nykaa has pathetic returning process. It was my first and last purchase from it. Let me make it clear that return had not been confirmed yet from their chat executive. They need pictures of product ( i found it ok) they also need invoice. Cant they access invoice on their own ? Worst experience ever with online shopping.
great experience
very good experience for nykaa product
"I'm a long time Nykaa costumer. Every experience was great go for this app 
guyzz."
Nice app for easy purchase experience.
"Its one of the most convinient apps ever...always have a great experience shopping from nykaa...my number one stop for skincare,haircare,makeup and lot more..."
Do not use this application. Terrible experience when it comes to returning a product. The executives are of no use and do jot provide a solution to the product returning issue. Felt liie they have run away with my money by delivering a horrible service and product.
Nykaa provides the most hassle-free and customer friendly online shopping experience ever!
"My experience has been somewhat good. But i dont understand why they send the packages separately.. shampoo in one package, conditioner in onother. it's very annoying."
Amazing Experience
Ok okay experience
Plz start delivery to Kashmir also.We too wanna experience ur services.
Awesome experience when shop with nykaa.. Its like all things under one roof..

Nykaa is totally love. All things required at one place and the best part is points after every purchase. These sweet and small gestures makes customers feel welcomed. Happy with till date experience and expect same in future. Love and well wishes ‚ù§
wonderful experience best for buying cosmetic üòçüòò
Superb experience üòä with products and their delivery.
"Nykaa seems like a fraud to me. They talk about discount but they don't give any discount. Awful experience ever. Purplle is better, because Purplle don't cheat us."
"Great product,great experience"
Previously had a bad experience but giving it a second try.. Hope it proves well this time

"always have best experience with this app, must shop from nyka"
Excellent shopping experience with wide range quality products. What I love the most is getting all products in one packing and at a time delivery for those ordered at one time.
Good experience but we can't selete 2 coupons üòèüòè
Worst experience with Nykaa! Products are good but customer care and service is really really bad! Not at all helpful customer care. People just know to disconnect the calls.
I can trust on Nykaa because products are original. Started shopping since 2015 & i have good experience with it.
Very good customer experience.
Nice experience.i would love to shop with nyka again and again because of the original products and fast delivery
"Great experience, original products, less time.."
"it used to be a good shopping experience,now they don't even care to reply to your feedback or query.The occasional discounts are still attractive but the longest delivery time ruins the charm .I switched from Jabong given nykaa's authenticity of products but I guess not anymore."
Very Bad experience.... Yet not delivered my products which i ordered.
My experience is good about this app
ausm shopping experience with nyka :) very happy with range of bodycare and cosmetic products... one stop destination for all ur bodycare needs... :)
"There is a 25%discount on lotus herbal 60g face cream,however the rate doesn't change as shown in the app. Please check it and do the needful. Otherwise it was a very pleasant experience."
product are very of very good qualities and the delivery is very quick my experience with online shopping was extremely bad but nykaa was the best platform for online shopping ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞

good experience
"My experience is overall great. Except fpr a few times, when they messed up with some really important orders."
Had a very good experience.
A very bad experience with this application as I got to know from some of my friends as well customer care services and refund issues are there I am going to uninstall it soon just waiting for my refund
The Best shopping experience!
Amazing experience
"Poor experience. I have ordered 3 items and not yet received it although the parcel is in the same city as delivery address since 7 days. Your Aramex courier service is worst, doesn't value it's customers. Don't understand why the hell they are not delivering the parcel. And don't give excuses like that is the 3rd party courier service.We trust Nykaa and we do not have anything to do with your courier services. That is your responsibility to satisfy your customers with the products ASAP. Amazon has delivered 2 items though I have ordered from both the apps the same day and Nykaa didn't even notifies about the parcel. My last shopping at Nykaa. Can't get any worse."
"no return policy. email pe email karo, return request except nahi hoti. dusaroki time aur money ki value nahi hai. bad experience üëé myntra is more useful app than nykaa."
Great experience with nykaa Very happy with the products and great sales.
Some products are having too less quantity but much amount it cost And more issue mainly everyone facing is about the delivery option Its just very bad experience becz may be many of them needed cosmetic items from nyka becz people trust nyka but your payment method is very bad becz may be some ladies didnt have ATM card or even a bank account or else someone doesnt need to buy 500 rs items.. so most of them get trouble while they dont have atm card to pay below 500. Pls try to make it okay
"The worst app ever.very bad experience with their service. I still did not 
receive my package."
Loved it Great shopping experience. It never disappointed me Alhamdulillah. Good work nyka.
Seamless shopping experience with lovely reward points
worst to worst experience... had ordered 6 lipsticks n 3 eye shadows out of 2 were recved broken n defected.. requested for refund bloody thy accepted frst to pick up n later rejected my request...so guys it's hopeless n waste of ur money n time.. so dun go for nykaa...
shopping with Nykaa my experience was always awesome..truly luv u nykaa‚ù§.
It was gud experience
Grt experience and good service
Pathetic experience from the beginning. I got wrong items and I have been mailing to them about my issue.I even talked to customer care through calls and chats everyday but my problem isn't solved yet.Its been 2 weeks and they are blaming that the products sent are correct.This is my second nykaa order and I'm afriad I wont get my order correctly.Its my stupidity that I placed so much money on your website for my second order.I regret my decision. Please dont keep more than 1k on nykaa orders.

great experience . all product are amazing üòçüòç
"Worst delivery experience...the due date for order delivery passed, I lodged one complaint, after two days again I called them and they are saying to wait for another 48hours..what a pathetic experience.. ticket number..1375930"
Good experience.
worst shopping experience ever. poor customer assistance. i would have given a rating in minus if there would have been that too. horrible and pathetic return and refund policy. you have yo wait for 3 months to get your issue resolved. never gonna do mistake of shopping from them. i have been delivered a wrong product which i did not need. fault is theirs still i have to face the trouble. a big no for online shopping from this site.

Amazing experience

"Genuine product... fast delivery, great experience"
Great experience
Horrible delivery experience with Nykaa.this is my second time I did not get my courier delivered because of extremely unprofessional courier partners of nykaa. They are rude unprofessional and absolutely callous. Getting the courier delivered in a suitable time frame is a night mare. The courier boy misbehave . Wrote to support@nykaa and yet no reply. I am shocked with nykaas bad service attitude towards a customer who was once loyal and would always order through Nykaa. Speaks a lot about the brand' s service attitude
lovely experience
Smooth experience while using the app... Loved it
Good experience
"Nice product, I m totally satisfied .Its my third experience n I love to have part of it."
great experience...on time delivery....gud quality products...cheers to Nykaa.
Very bad experience ..orders are not shown in my order list.. Have been using this app for long time but now it's worst experience . Expect my order list rest all are functioning
"Bad costumer service ever ,I hate this app , wrost shopping experience ever."
Great experience
"U can trust on nykaa .gives so good offers on high end and drugstore brands that too sitting at home. Buying cosmetics can get no better. Edit- I don't know what happened after i praised this app on playstore. Bad experiences one after another. Delayed delivery, fake products and now missing. How many times do i have to email nykaa for my missing product. I've made full payment and also mailed nykaa that i got incomplete order with one of my product missing. Uploaded a pic, what else u ppl want"
a pleasant experience. takes some time to process refunds on order cancellation and discounts can be improved.
Nice experience üòä
Very good experience
Horrible experience with the chat bot. Was stuck on it for more than an hour. One of the items not delivered and I was asked to report there. When we don't respond ( being working from home) they close the issue saying we didnt respond on time. And make us wait for 15-20mins on the chat. I am hooked to it so that I don't jave to give the details all over again. Atleast 3 different people I had to give the details
Very good experience. Good quality products. All Images match in actual. Easy delivery options. Convenient Shopping. Prices are certainly less than Shops.
frist experience
It's amazing experience.. üòç
I'm a regular buyer from Nykaa. Still now my experience with this store is tooooooo impressive. They deliver products within a few days. And I must say that their products are original and good. You can trust them undoubtedly. Thank you nykaa for being my most favourite shopping store !! Love ‚ù§Ô∏è
It takes all sorts of payments! It is the most convenient interface!
Nykaa gives you best experience with best products. üòäüòä
"I have been happy customer with Nykaa. Its wide range of products has made 
shopping a fun experience. The tutorials by Nykaa are easy to follow and 
help creating awareness regarding various products, their uses and also 
guides us in choosing the rigjt product."
Tried for first time and worst experience . Very disappointed by nykaa they did not deliver me any product even I ordered product twice and when I called them they are saying it's not ur fault it was from our side then to did not solved my problem
my first purchase in nykaa.. waiting for the delivery.. so far so good experienceüòä
Amazing experience just go ahead
Very bad experience. Extremely poor service. I placed my order on 23 october 2017 neither did it reach my destination i waited for 2 weeks it was dispatched and yet not delivered.  I canceled and asked for a refund its been 3 week i still havent got my refund. Everytime i call up they say will revert back. They never do. Very disappointing customer service.

I am really new at this nyka app so I don't have much information on this app. But I till now I don't have a bad experience with the app regarding the shopping and exploring it. Though I have not really sure because I have never used a beautiful online app before but I really hope that I have a good experience with using the nyka app and that it doesn't give me any dissapointed customer issues with it in any way possible. Till now Nykaa -Beauty shopping app has been good to me about it use and experience with it.(beauty shopping).
Nice experience so far

Wonderful Experience üòçüòçüòç
"Worst experience. Never place a order on nykaa. They have some third party courier service who never has person to deliver your order. You will get message in the morning that it is out for delivery and in the evening you will get a message that ""sorry we couldn't deliver"". This will keep happening. Moreover, nykaa support team could not assure you about its delivery. I really regret that I paid money online and placed a order on nykaa in first place"
"best place to buy makeup, I am extremely happy with my experience, I ordered 2 days back and I spoke to agent on chat named David for early delivery from expected date and he made it... I am super happy with services... love you nykaaaa ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Very bad experience I got wrong product and made return request 15 days ago but still it is in panding state only. No one came to pick the product nor got refund. U guys just sending emails. Man who get time to reply on mail when i am buying product from app. In app i did't get any update for my product return. Wirst service
Very bad experience
Amazing products and delivery on timeüëç good experience with nykaa
amazing shopping experience with desirable products and offers‚ù§Ô∏è
"I'm not sure whether to give a single star or not but I'm telling you from my personal experience with dear NYKA. First of all they kinda delay orders you placed, it almost takes half a month and after shipping the orders get delayed much more and at last when there are too much orders in the given delivery locations they kinda cancelled your given orders. I've waited for two months and guess what its cancelled. Telling you from my personal experience, do not order online from nyka app."
"Really sorry but I had to edit my feedback as I had a bad experience with Nykaa. I ordered a face wash and it seems that the bottle was sent with less then half face wash in it.. Which is really bad, I guess the discounts given to us is also applicable on compromising the quantity of amount we get in the package that we order.. Please look into this coz I had to order the same face wash but disappointment that the second one also came with less then half bottle filled with wash."
very good experience. excellent service
‚ù§‚ù§ very good experience...
good experience
Best experience with nykaa..thanks a lot..
Good experience üòÅüòÅ
"Worst experience. Ordered a lipstick almost a month before, it is in out for delivery status for last 2 weeks. So I am not able to cancel the order also. Support team and their courier partners are useless."
Pleasant on-line shopping experience ...and a wide variety of quality products...
we experienced Dmart of cosmeticsüòç
Extremely poor delivery experience. One order received in Three parts ... and extremely delayed delivery. This was my first order from Nykaa.. and Last one for sure üëéüëé
I must say. Love this app. Used it 1st time. Though i love it interface. Being an IT engineer i love it looks. But fill like product searching interface can be more improved. So we can see all available product easily. Good job done. Wish products also come genuine & good.
Awesome experience
very bad experience I ordered three product from nykaa on 26th march.til the product is not delivered due to undelivered area. they are not refund my money yet.
"i am having great experience, products are really amazing."
Would never like to order anything from this app. Will not recommend anyone to go and try this business out to buy anything. Given the times we live in and where other ecommerce businesses giving priority to the customer experience rather than cheating them. How come no return option available for the products that does not match to the customers expectation. Disappointing.
Wonderful experience ‚ô•Ô∏è
Bad experience my refunds is not back in my account
Nice experience
"great experience with nyka, awesome products, excellent discount, and most trusted brand. save online payments, guarantee refund very happy with this........"
very nice app... easy to use.... gud offers .... very good experience till now
"The experience is so bad. The customer care support are not there to support. I have ordered one product on nykaa and the product is still in same status from past 7 days. And if you talk to the support they are very irritating they will reply your query after so much wait, that to it is of no use. Very bad experience. Worst for shopping."
"Please don't ever stop doing what you do. It's the only place I believe won't deceit its patron. Genuine products, best customer service. I had an issue which was nicely handled. And now they're into clothing also, which is even better. Looking forward to a similar experience at Nykaa Fashion too. I am so glad that Nykaa exists. ‚ù§"
amazing experience
It was amazing experience with nykaa but I feel sometime you provide some products experience in comparison to other sites.
Such a bad and worst experience I got actually I ordered it such normal product and i will show u will net 24-48 hr in case if check next day or less week also same thing it will be show no proper updation about product until we talk with customer care and one thing they is no cash on delivery below 500 rupees in this case we have move on some apps they doing very well comparing to this one
always a great experience
Great experience...all the brands are available here üëç

My frist experience .. with nykaa is on fleek .. love u nykaa
Overall wonderful experience
Best beauty site in india...awesome shopping experience over last one year...original products at very best price...the best thing is the products which are exclusively available on nykaa are not available on other site ..awesome customer support...very happy with the app ‚ò∫
"A nice app with a welcoming interface and if you look for a specific item then you will get distracted by many more wide varieties of wonderful cosmetics. And the delivery was real quick last time but considering the area to which we are buying to, is solely dependent on it."
My experience with Nykaa is amazing and the products are really good!
"I really enjoy the shopping experience at Nykaa.But can you please stop advertising so much, it's really annoying."
"Love nykaa and the whole idea of their app, giving you a plethora of options, all under one roof!!!! Have always had a wonderful experience with their shipping and their products are just fabulous!!!! Keep adding more & more brands for people like me üòä! Way to go, Nykaa!!!!üëç"
It's amazing. nice experience with nykaa loved itü•∞ü•∞

Good experience
superb experience

"nykaa is one of my favourite brands, i usually do cosmetic shopping from here only . i am a satisfied customer and recommend everyone to experience it once in your life and you will love it."
Always like this Nice experience
lovely experience
Great experience with Nykaa
Never had any bad experience while using this app..
Worst service ever experienced. Trust me. The shipment went back even without me rejecting me. The shipment went back because of the mad delivery guy who texted me at 3am that he may not be able to deliver the order because he had a function to attend and sent it back. Nykaa then asked me to place a new order when the prices went up for the product. I think it is a scam or the delivery guy was abusive. This is where women feel insecure. Coz i am afraid of the delivery guy.
Good experience Love shopping üõçfrom here. I am always satisfied. Thanks nykaa.
Horrible experience .
My experience was very good on nykaa genuine brands with genuine products
Worst experience the product came was used it had lipstick stains on it.. Sluggish response from customer care!
I have a huge disappointment with nykaa. I placed an order recently on my birthday month (May) & was supposed to get Nykaa prive birthday gift. But I received the order without the prive gift. In app it was showing that the gift was on it's way but upon checking the order's section there was no such order. When I checked with customer service team they told me that due to some technical glitch the gift wasn't added. This was so unexpected & I have such a pathetic experience on my birthday month!
Good interface. Good deal of products.
"I heard that Nykaa is a very nice app. But my experience is different. I ordered 2 pieces of same product, but received 1 piece perfect and another is a different one on 26.07.2021. I made request for replacement of the wrongly sent product on 27.07.2021, but still no replacement done. It's already 5 days gone. I need the product very badly. But the customer care executives are unable to answer about when can I get the replacement. Horrible experience about Nykaa which was beyond expectations."
my experience is very good with Nayka but want to add one thing plzz start your COD on bill less than 500 also
great experience with nykaa.keep going
Awsm experience
great experience
"Worst experience, your delivery executive would never call and return my order saying the address is not proper, however while speaking to your customer executive I told her to google the same address it was found that the address is fine and because of the issue at your end you are telling me to make a prepaid order and not accepting COD."
Overall nice experience with Nykaa.
"Nykaa has given me the ever worst experience that i never had in my life time... This is such a stupid application, and i have experienced huge negligence for my order from the workers in the team . I placed one order , and i mentioned particular date , and they came to deliver before the date...and i was unavailable that time.even after mentioning the particular ""from and to "" date they did like that .and after i called many and many times the customer care , and informed as within 48 hours i will get my product, and i never get my product ,and they were keep on saying after 48 hours after 48 hours. Many 48 hours over , i never recieved my product , and moreover 1 day in midnight i got a message mentioning as i myself canelled my product ,that time i was sleeping , i never canelled the product , and i saw the message in the morning , and i wonder how could this happened. And this is the way they blame the customers ,They never responded after that, but they keep on sending message like they will deliver my product today ...but i never received my product ... I prefer you all should never choose , or depened on nykaa for your beauty products .this is such a worst company and the team and very much negligent about the customers...saying from my own experince . I have never experienced this kind of negligence from any of other companies... And this is the second time i am facing this kind of experience. Thats what i want you all to know the truth about this company and their service is the worst...such and idiotic people they are..."
Reliable product with authencitation certificate from all brand companies.. good experience
"If I've ever had a bad customer experience while shopping online, it's with this nykaa. They will send you used products and then won't return them either. My complaint regarding Order number 500514862 has been not rectified even after constant calls and emails. I am never using this rubbish app ever. Kindly refund my money."
had a gr8 experience
Original products. Gud experience.
Great experience‚ù§Ô∏è
"Very bad experience, it's been more than a week, my order is still being delayed for no reasons..uninstalling it right away.."

Its been an amazing experience with NYKAA. When there is a question in your mind regarding quality and original products you should switch to nykaa only .i loved it.‚ù§Ô∏è
Bad experience there delivery boy is very uneducated they don't know how to talk and very bad experience
Best experience alwaya use nykaa
I have been using this app for years now and had a good experience with this app until the beginning of December 2019 but since then I am unable to order anything as it has stopped delivering to the Northeast parts of India and rather gives lame excuses and talks about delivery partner not being assigned and stuffs like this. Total disappointment üò°
Loved the shopping experience. Got some Great deals! The only tiny problem I faced was not being able to jump to the homepage while scrolling through products to reach the categories panel.
This app is too good... My experience can't be described in words.. Products are genuinely too good here..
every time i had great experience to buying with u nykka...love u.....!!!!
Wonderful experience.
very bad experience I ordered 3 items from innisfree and they took the money for 3 items but delivered only 2 and also they don't respond to their fraudulent .
great experience with nykaa
"Just one word for this app ""Mind blowing""üòáüòá experience as much as I have since i start till now ;great saving, nice deals ,I definitely recommend to others and dear once; worth it NYKKA store for buying cosmetics stuff best quality brands are available here...must give at least once visit on Nykka app"
"Pathetic customer care service , if you are unfotunately not at your place when the delivery man comes , that order might not be delivered to you , you to call nykaa several times ,they will tell to wait and wait , pathetic experience I got , i cant directly call the delivery man and ask u to redeliver , u have to call nykaa several times and also to bluedart , if your customer care can not provide a help regarding these simple issues then why u have a customer care?????????????"
"Bad experience with nykka.. Order not delivered on date.. And after date.. 
Till now I did not get my order.."
My experience was good
Beautiful experience...my personal shop at a click away
"Perfect shopping experience, app is flawless"
I have ordered lots of item from nykka and my experience is always awesome Every product is as per images and description and app is also easy to use.
Best app not a single bad experience Nykaa rock's....
Great experience
super exciting experience
My order is delivered only in 2 days... nicely packed and completely hassel free... This was my 1st experience with Naykaa and trust me not the last for sure!!!!
Best experience ever
"Terrible interface. I ordered a product, which was in stock (5 pieces were left) and somehow these bozos messed up my order and never delivered it. There are better app than this to get the products."
"Worst experience ever, return policy is worst ,its better to buy from other app ,I would love to prefer go outside than buying from nykaa , i wont be purchasing anything from nykaa"
Great experience
Great experience
I want to suggest that keep more stock of the discounted items. I had bad experience every time. The item i want to order at that price it was always been sold out. So look into it.
"Wonderful experience, user friendly, product variety and range is great."
Great experience!
"Worst experience ever. The courier partner is just pathetic, and to top it up the customer care too doesn't give a proper solution. Since last 6days I have been calling Nykaa to resolve my issue, but of no help (payment already made however product not received which was supposed to be delivered on 7th Nov). I am writing here with a hope that my matter gets picked up."
"Good experience, genuine products, prompt and easy delivery."
Good experience
Have ordered thrice during this pandemic. This out of all my purchases has been the most hassle free and timely. I hope these experiences remain constant each time. Keep up the good work! And yes bdw they pack stuff with utmost care. Loved it ‚ù§
"Very bad experience, my order delivery date was on 18 aug but the date is 19 aug and I still don't recive the order"
First time my order. No experience....
Awesome experience

"Worst experience, I have ordered on 14th April, not received my product yet, Poor service, complaining about the same from last 7 days, but nykaa team did not even bother to reply. Guys do not use nykaa app in lock down, they take the money but did not delivered your products, 1670 rupees is stuck there."
good experience with NYKAA.
"Love the discounts and the user interface of the app, makes online Shopping enjoyable"
"User friendly interface, good offers, get to know undiscovered brands"

Always I have a good experience with Nyka tnx fr d Cosmetics which I got from dis.. but the only problem is abt refund I want to return one of the stuff which I got recent orders but can't coz of cancelling my return request. I don't know why nyka is cancelled my return request
"My experience with Nykaa is very good, need fast delivery."
"Horrible experience I just bought huda beauty obsession pallete for Rs. 2495 it has no discount and when I try to return it because it's not at all worth of the money so then they are saying that we can't return the money , they can delivered the product in delivering the product the covid pandemic doesn't exist but when we have to return it back they are saying that due to covid pandemic we can't return it back.. Woww such a nice explanation I will never suggest anyone to buy anything frm nykka"
amazing experience till date...All d best team...
Wonderful experience
Overall good experience
Great app. Easy to use. Love the interface.
worst experience while using this app
"I loved shopping from this app , and they ship original products that is why I always recommend it to others for online shopping in skincare , hair , makeup related products and many more and the delivery is also fast compared to other apps There are also many more reasons why I love shopping from this app . I've such a great experience on this app."
"The worst site. I ordered 2 lip crayons and got 1 free, where the colours were exactly the same. When I tried to return them they clearly said they won't return the crayons as I have tried it on my hand to know the colour. Tell me one thing how would I know the colour of the lip stick if I don't use a little bit on my hand ?? Worst experience. Clearly first and the last one!!! You guys are such a CHEAT!!"
Great shopping experience...love buying from here
Best experience in my life with nykaa
It's great experience while shopping with nyka.. Awesome products & ultimate offers
It was very nice experience
"Pathetic site. I ordered something and that product was not even in stock there and they placed my order..due to non availability of product at there end, they took more than a week to ship my product and it is not shipped even today. My 1st experience with this site is horrible."
Worst app with worst customer service. I doubt them they don't sell authentic products I ordered blue heaven shade 11 which is pinkish brown in reality but they provided me some different peach colour and didn't even accepted my return request besides that the mabelline fit me foundation was used and empty that was also rejected . My experience with this app was very bad. I won't suggest this to anyone .
Very bad experience.. Delivery too much late.. I booked my orders 6th of October 2020 today the date is 14th of October 2020 still my order is not coming
good experience of shopping
experienced great to shop from nykaa
Love the products and vert convenient to purchase fast delivery. amazing experience!
Very bad experience plz don't download this bakwas aap waste of money and time
Good experience
"Good experience with nykaa but I not satisfied with the lipstick item, I order but I receive broken piece and I wish the returning process can be more easy. ""Thank u team nykaa for all gud products."
"The worst experience regarding there courier service by Bluebat they are not picking up the call neither giving me any information regarding my products I have ordered them a week ago there is no response from there side, then to there customers service number is not toll free and when ever we call they just pick up the phone and there is no instructions and also msg from there side is not clear as they didn't mention the tracking details of the product. Whenever asking for the product update they say tomorrow we will delivering but there is no information..... Pathetic service of bluedart and they also don't provide any contact number of delivery boy..... Nykaa should take the action regarding this..."
Love this app and my experience is very good
"I received a damaged product from Nykaa and I asked them to initiate the return procedure and refund my money. I got a message from nykaa that the return request is approved on 7th November and within 3 days the amount would be reflected in my bank account. Today is 21st, till now nothing I got and no one came take the damaged product also. Nykaa your service really sucks. This is the first time I used nykaa and this wonderful my experience is!"
Ordered a color and actually it is something different bad experience
amazing experience
The nykaa's products are very good as well as very good delivery and good experience
"My experience with Nykaa has always been wonderful, undoubtedly one of the most trustworthy apps!"
"Very very bad experience. Very poor customer service. I got a defective product and when initiated a return/refund for the same the snapshot of the defective product was not being accepted by the app. When checked with customer care, they are asking us to courier the product and telling pick up service not available at the postal code. Like really, how were they able to deliver the product here then. I want to tell please don't use nykaa. Worst online shopping app ever"
"Worst experience ever üò† bcoz i ordered it 5 days ago and i got it a message dat i will be delivered within two days but now its more den 5 days and still i haven't received it, nd now receiving the msgs dat my order delivery is failed, will u please let me get what i ordered with a smooth delivery"
Good experience ü•∞
Great both in shopping as well as answering queries & including refund system. Love to shop at one genuine beauty products here. Enjoy the experience.
"It's a wonderful experience shopping through nykaa, but where I 
disappointed is.. I didn't receive my last order perfectly I received an 
unsealed product, and the delivery to my address took really long time, 
must see what happens this time"
Awesome experience - wonderful app
Good experience
Very good experience
If there is some number less than 1 star I would have gone for that. I have very bad experience with NYKAA. I have made an order for my sister birthday on 3rd April wherein today date is 16th April and I couldn't get it delivered for her birthday which left me with mere disappointment. Their delivery partner SHADOWFAX is insane and they have the poorest customer support ever. I end up the gift I ordered for my sister not reached before her bday :( I would definitely not recommend NYKAA ever.
Very good experience
the products and the user interface is amazing and top notch!
Please don't buy a product at this platform very bad service experience they provide expired and damage product
"There is severe functianality issues regarding the delivery, no matter what the address be no matter what the phone number be, the delivery guy doesnt even call and i get messages like failed delivery attempt. I had 4 bad experiences before and i am trying one last time."
great experience
"It was a lovely experience shopping from Nykaa. It has an array of options 
which makes it even more fun."
I feel very good experience
"Worst experience during lockdown. I am not able to track my placed order in ""my order"" section.. it's continuously showing try again something went wrong .. and after contacting customer care through email and also raised the ticket but no reply from them.. frustrating it is because they are not interested to reply for ur mail or ticket. Disappointing it is !"
great service and delivery to original product and good packaging i was great experience shopping for nykaa and I have been shopping for a long time to nykaa
User friendly interface and very good products
Very bad experience.. I ordered something a week ago and I haven't received it yet. Very bad delivery partners. They are not even making an attempt to deliver the product.! 0.5/5
Good experience
Worst experience with nayka they committed for 15 days return or exchange but cancle the return Request ......just becoz of there new policy .......which policy and conditions customer doesn't know .
"Love the app, great experience and cool offers. The MAC flash sale was awesome!"
"They sell fake products on this app, I had given 5stars initially for this app had to edit it because of my experience with them....very poor costumer response too....this app doesn't deserve even 1star"
Great experience shopping with naykaaa...
Overall experience is good...but It would be more appropriate when they provide free shipping on order of RS.500.... Now the limit extend to 1000 bucks...which is lil difficult to shop.
fabulous experience shopping with nykaa
Great experience
"Ordered Wow Science Apple Cider Foaming Face Wash and a moisturizer for myself from Facebook. Second purchase done today for Vitamin C face Foaming wash a refill pack and a Night cream. The products are very good. Delivery is smooth, if there is a delay they are messaging and informing. Very good service and I'm going to receive this app to my family and friends. Thank you for the shopping experience."
Really good experience. Happy with the products purchased earlier and the service rendered.
Very worst experience. Don't provide service on time. Amazon is better than this
Very good app for shopping. Nice experience. ‚ù§
Very bad experience i have seen ever bcs of they dont give any type of cancletion option and any type of update of when i get my order not any type dellevery agents phone number they give ....
great experience
"Worst customer experience, received a damaged product, provided all required photos, still the request for return/exchange rejected for no reason, no customer support numbers are working. Dont buy products from nykaa use alternative apps they provide far better customer support."
Great experience with nykaa
"I received a coupon code for signing up and it is not working. Even my cart value was 1206 INR, but on applying the coupon it is showing the error that cart is not eligible. Highly disappointed. Very bad experience of using Nykaa."
Nice experience
I HV great experience with all shipping product süòò
"Worst, pathetic and very bad service.......Minus 10000 points for the nyka service, i had a pathetic experience with this platform, i have ordered on 1 January 20 and today it is 10th January i have not received the order yet the custom service is the worst service i have ever come across, i will suggest you to never order from here and if you order please never pre pay it cause after that you have to check for your order they are very irresponsible for their work."
Nyka has the worst service i have ever experienced ..you are definitly not commited for your customers ..
Except late delivery.. wonderful experience
I love shopping with nykaa. They sell the best genuine product. its about to a year since i am shopping with nykaa And never have any bad experience.They have beauty advisors who suggest according to your skin type and reply within few minutes. This app is Totally recommend
Fantastic experience
"It is a good experience to shop through nyka. It is not only an All in one 
for cosmetics but also trustworthy!!"
"Okay so I have been a regular customer of NYKAA for more than a year now. I have never had any serious issue as long as there was COD. But this one day, I placed a gift order for my friend and it was prepaid. Guess what? Only one of the items is delivered and other not but the app shows both are delivered. You see NYKAA team, one bad experience and I'm forced to give you 1 star rating. I have been trying to connect with you but the helpline number is not working. And there's no such help given in the app. I can't connect with you via mail as your mailing ID is not mentioned anywhere. Look into my issue. This is sheer CHEAT."
My experience is good with nykaa
"didnot want to give 1 star but i hv to..worst experience ever didnot get order in exact time and date.. its been 20 days i didn't gt my order, complained so many times but not yet fixed.."
I have been given a promo code when I asked to return a product. Now I am trying that promo code to buy other product but it's not working. Fraud site should work on return policy and provide valid coupon code otherwise no customer will come back. This was first shopping experience from nykaa and probably last now. Even they are not providing reward points too. And they hve fool CCE.
A really good experience
"While they do give good products & services but they won't come to pick the product if you want to return it.So yes,return policy is dissapointing and they won't even respond to your return requests.(From my personal experience)"
nice experience
"Good experience Nykaa products is really nice, Happy with that..."
Cannot solve a simple issue. worst customer service ever experienced.
"I find nykaa the best app for the beauty products as in say it's ""Thee best"", The most trust worthy app and also the reviews inside. I buy every product by seeing the reviews below they are very genuine and I also appreciate the users who had reviewed on the products which gives the other users to know the product more. I would also like to suggest the app that it would give the best experience for users if you add how to use the product as well so that it makes the first buyers know more ."
Good experience
Bad experience i m disappointed from nykaa
Always a pleasant experience to shop from Nykaa.
Great experience üëç
Great experience. Loved shopping.
Love all the products and user experience is awesome
Amazing experience Excellent products üòç What is shown is deliveredüòÄ permanemt customer of nykaa amazing service provided with every best option available
Worst app i have been a regular shopper from naykaa but the return policy sucks the service is just the worst i have ever experienced it's been more than a week since i have placed a return request but every time they are saying we are working on it don't know how many days they need more . Worst service than even an unpopular apps
Good experience
Awesome experience
Good experience
My experience Soo far is very good
"Using since 2015, always had an best experience with Nykaa"
Bad experience with my first order.. Very disappointed with the delivery services
Great Products at Great Prices! Loving the experience of shopping on the App! üëå
Good shopping experience. Hope Nykaa introduces some more korean beauty brands besides Innisfree and the Face Shop.. Like Cosrx Etude House etc..
Worst experience with this app.they have the worst coustomer care services and delivery services.I am going to uninstall this app.
Worst experience...I have ordered 3 items from nykaa but didn't receive one item. Now m trying to contact and sent emails regarding my issue but no one is helping Worst experience with nykaa.
"I m having trouble for my current order. It's been a week now my order is not been delivered. In tracking it shows it is out for delivery, delivery on hold, and all other rubish. I paid full amount but not having good experience this time. Very much disappointed. Never expected this from nykaa."
It's a nice experience to shop from this app üòä‚ù§
"A must have app. They got genuine products and very easy interface. I love 
nykaa!!"
awesome experience
The new interface off the app is not nice at all.... The app was already really slow... And its speed has become even worse... Also maybe it would be better if the images of the products in the grid view are maximised.
"It has always been a wonderful experience, while shopping at nykaa ."
"awesome experience, will wait for delivery to comment on propmtness"
"The another name of nykaa is cheating. i received torn outfit for which I raised a return request, afyer waiting for a well They have rejected my return request as they have checked with the internal team, and they are sure that they haven't send the torn product. I have never had this experience with Amazon and Flipkart. I feel now nykaa is earning money by sending defective products to customers and then reject the request"
gr8 experience
So far had a great experience üëç
good experience
Very nice experience üòç
Even in my village also i get nykaa ....a perfect delivery experience and pay on delivery option thank you nykaa.....
"ü•∞My ""Nykaa"" Shopping experience has always been really good ,it has exciting offers,with best packaging and detailed descriptions of products.Being a makeup lover Nykaa is my ‚ù§"
"User-friendly app, wide range of product variety, good experience."
"Love to shop with nykaa, would have given 5 star but the only problem i have is with eyeshadow palettes. They always come broken and mess. They should do a better packaging for powder based products other than that it's a good experience to shop."
once i have started using nyka i have been a huge fan of it... everytime it manages to give me an awestruck experience...
Great offers..Good quality products. Loved the experience.Thanks Nykaa!!
"This app is really helpful... I bought many products,all are good...Good experience.."
amazing experience...loved it
It's really annoying ...hated this app .i ordered few items but not received ..on one hand they show it's in shipping on the other hand they are saying delivery failed . neither there is any option to cancle the order. I followed there guide but still didn't got any cancle option. there query section is the most annoying.every time they would ask you stupid questions and you would never get any reply from there side only a default message will come saying there members are offline you would get your query in few minutes but you would not get anyüò§üò§üò§ worst experience of online shopping
Good experience!!
Aapko paise ki limit hta deni chahiye.. first purchase ki 500 rs limit h aur uske baad 700 rs ki.. bs ye ni accha lga mujhe nykaa ka.. bad experience
Great shopping experience.Please try to store sesderma products & more of dermaceutical products..
"Installed the app for better experience ..had to wait hours n houres to 
logged in..man who have time to waste on a simple appl ike nothing else to 
do in this planet.make it atleast user friendly .worst app ever"
"Delivers wrong products. Customer services are as bad as you can imagine. 
Returning a product is a headache. Worst shopping experience."
Love the experience!
Best experience
i have an awesome experience with nyka....they provide good discounts and original products...and also with quick delivery
Very bad delivery experience. Sent the wrong products and did not do anything about it even after raising concerns 5 times
Worst experience ever!! No support from contact team. They just ask to wait for 48hrs and 72hrs and do no provide any update after that. Would never recommend to anyone
"I occasionally buy products from nykaa and have never faced such kind of service until now. I was not satisfied with the product and wanted to return the item and get the refund for the same. I got a mail from nykaa that said electrical appliances are covered under manufacturer warranty and therefore is not eligible for returns by nykaa and they asked me to contact the brand(nova) directly. I contacted nova but then they told me that they are not responsible for returns of the product and nykaa is. I am really disappointed with nykaa's service. I really liked nykaa but after this experience, i don't think i will be buying or recommending nykaa to anyone."
My first experience with this app is too bad I have ordered a shampoo from that on 30 july and today date is 8 August I have not arrived this item this app is not for just only 1 üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§
Experience is good
Most awful experience with nykaa the worst app for shopping.i dint find a single product useful at a reasonable price during this hot nykaa sale it's high time you should stop making fool of publicüëç
"Worst experience ever, i ordered product its been 40 days i have not received the same nor any refund is being granted i called there customer care provider for 2-3 times no action has been taken by them yet ."
original product they are doing amazing job...thank you nayka for providing us such a good products .purchased so many products all are good .except one bad experience..lipstick from wet and wild
"really very good experience with nykaa, Always will like to give 5 star to nykaa."
Have been a good experience with the authenticity of the product and timely delivery so far.
"Good interface, helpful filters, app is very well organized"
The app is very good for ordering cosmetics but it doesn't deliver items and I experienced it twice. Without my consent my orders got cancelled.
I m feeling very happy.. Its a nice app.. But i hav ordered a lipstick 3month before. Lakme natural matte lipstick.. That was broken inside... And lipstick item in your app hasnt return option... I was feeling very bad.... Overall very good experience... Thank you
Easy and great shopping experience! Everything you ever need will be available. Great offers and very quick delivery! Nykaa is a revolution!
Good experience
I ordered many times from Nykaa and experience was always good.But this time I received multiple damaged products. One of the products is dried from inside and many other products are not sealed. So I contacted their customer service. The customer care representative was very rude and arrogant. He kept on arguing that the products are not visibly damaged and delaying the replacement process. This kind of experience is not expected from a brand like Nykaa.
Horrible experience
Love the app experience.products match their description.üëç
My first experience with nykaa is very disappointed I place an order and they says delivery date is 30 December 2019 But the product is not yet delivered till date I am very unsatisfied with this service
"Its a hassle free experience but it would be nice if it includes the ingredients list,like if its paraben free etc"
It's been two weeks and till now my order has not been arrive. Bad services I've experienced ever
overall good experience
"A worst ever app, yesterday i got my delivery of products according to their choice not of what I asked for. They dont even apologize and the hell lot of instructions they give to correct the blunders they created. Wasted my money on buying. Bad delivery service. The customer care speaks so rudely as if they are giving for free. This was my first order and worst experience. I would never recommend anyone."
my experience with nykaa is awesome ..the products nd deals are great sometimes they offer very interesting deals on branded products nd no doubt all products are coming in very good packaging . I Totally love nykaa
"I had purchased 5 items,out of which 1 has arrived and remaining are still pending. After repeated calls to wow express the only thing they have to say is we will come tomorrow. This is my sincere request to nykaa that please take back my orders as I dont want them.And I wont be shopping with you guys anymore, also I will share my experience with everyone on social media dont ignore my comment. I will do as I say you have my word."
Awesome experience never ever shopping for beauty prods hve been so easy and stress free..
Awesome experience...Loved it.
Excellent shopping experience. it is amazing app. you get genuine products and amazing discount . I am very happy with this app

"Wow experience with this app, love to shop here"

Most of my shopping is from cosmetic category, the reviews by customers here are so honest and precise, really love going by them. However I would like to propose that if discounts can be attached to the OGX products too, it will be really üëç."
Great experience

Very gud experience!!!!
Very bad experience with nykaa .had ordered three product ..the product got cancelled without informing ..careless
"Worst experience with return service of Nyka, Received expired products and no action has taken to my return request."
I have an amazing experience with Nykaa. Always I received good quality and genuine products from Nykaa.
my first experience was very at nyka.... üòçüòçloved it...
"I'm a lifestyle blogger. Never had a bad experience with Nykaa. At one point my 2 consecutive sale order lipstick came without proper expiry label and dried. The team was super quick on chat and calls and they made sure the refund is done on time. Infact I've loved that they started WA invoice and details. Many of us don't read normal msgs and are into WA most of the time so this is surely the best thing. P. S. I've not been paid to say all this, my experience with Nykaa undoubtedly is the best"
It was a good and fruitfull experience.
Bad experience...nykaa not retruned my refund.....no one is responding....i lost my 4950‚Çπ.....üò¢i request dont buy any thing from nykaa...i dont know but many peoples also faced refund problem...fraud nykaaa....
"I had a wonderful experience. Thank you, Nyka for being there"
Nice experience
Nykaa never disappoints me anytime.Delivers my order within 24 hrs. Products come in well condition nd genuine. My 1st choice is always nykaa. Very nice experience of shopping since 2 yrs.
It's a well managed application to find almost all beauty products that possibly cost more somewhere else. experience was satisfactory!
I love to buy a products in discount whenever I see a discount on nykaa.. I just buy it whatever I need so.. Thank you nykaa great experience with you all time shopping partner just nykaa...
Awesome experience shopping with nykaa

"Highly dissatisfied. Placed an order but on the day of delivery instead of getting the product delivered, receives a message regarding the delivery and soon after another message saying the product was not delivered. my friend had similar experience. Very unprofessional of a recognized name like Nykaa. On the top of it, customer care executives doesn't know how to talk and behave properly."
"Nykaaa app is jussst lovvvvve‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞ü•∞So happy with the experience,all the products, At a great discount and the main thing,AUTHENTICITY !

I was such a great Experience with Nykaa.. but please try to avail COD At least 300 Above !!
super experience with u Nykaa. best price high quality. loved it
Excellent experience with nykaa i am just love
Very bad experience from past and with of my recent order as well. I have ordered 5 items and with 1 they offer free kit as well. They kept 2 seperate order for both the orders. Delievery partner never called for second order and now I recieved a messgae stating order undelivered. Pathetic Experience
If here any option for zero then I give the zero star. Very bad experience in nykaa. I ordered some products from nykaa bt i don't get all the products. So I complained that i did not get all the products. My products are missing. Bt they didn't do anything about that. Don't waste your money. Don't order from nykaa. There Customer and chat support system is worst. They are not helpful.
Always a pleasurable experience to shop on nykaa!!
"It's good app, so far the experience is good."
loved it .. absolutely a wonderful experience shopping on Nykaa app
"Best discounts, best offers. People give honest reviews, no fake or paid reviews. Wide variety. Try on option. Software of app is very smooth. Good product discrimination. Reviewers can post picture, which helps others to see the actual product when used. Nice experience. Packing & products too are nice. Mashaallah, what an app! ü§©ü§©ü§©"
"Nice App Easy to use , most of the time I have good experience with nykaa good product's and on Time delivery love nykaa"
till now no bad experience
"Tried to order from this app very first time..first of all i received my 
order very late..(3 days after the last expected date) & finally when i got 
my order 2 out of my 6 products were damaged! Very bad experience."
"Very bad experience.. I ordered some products on 30th November but they haven't delivered yet after 16 days.. customer service is also terrifying, don't give u the support as required.Not expect this type of carelessness from Nykaa...very disappointed."
very good experience I loved it. receiving product on time. ‚ô•
Awsum experience
"Starting from the offer, quality, packaging, app experience its all damn goodüòç"
"Service is worst! Delivery boys don't listen the instructions and disconnect the calls. I didn't get my order as per the request. Rest of the online shopping stores listen to the requests, they don't simply cancel without hearing the customer out! First timer, and poor experience!"
Best experience....
Shipment of our ordered product becameing late....also not much satisfied response from your customers care services ... How many days want to reach our ordered product?üòìüòïüòìüòï 1 st experience in nykaa is my bad experience üòìüòï
Wonderful experience
"Pathetic app I've ever used. Firstly, they don't accept your order, then there is no updates for tracking. The order is delivered late and they don't even confirm the return products as well. The time usually taken for accepting exceed. This was the worst experience I ever had. No action has been taken even after emailing them."
Very nice app.. quick delivery and almost all products are available easily. Excellent experience üëç

Amazing experience High quality products
Good experience
i have had a good experience with nykaa so far. good work
Layout of the app is so easy to understand. Every product is very well categorised and easy tl find according to need. Purchasing experience is so smooth. Authentic brands and original products.
That was my first and last experience with nykaa. I had ordered from nykaa. And after waiting for 20 days I have received used and wrong product from them. Delivery service has been pathetic. They are just giving so called offers to attract customers and delivers used or expired products.
awesome experience 100‚ÑÖ original products great discounts üòãüòâüòâüòâ
Awesome experience
Nykaa is very good app amazing experience the only thing I don't like is they don't have cod on less than 700 rupees that's sometimes irritates
Fantastic experience
Always good experience
My experience with Nykaa is the best It helps save time in this busy life I am happy shopping with Nykaa....Love u Nykaa
"Best experience of shopping online. I always shop from nykaa. Genuine

"Great experience , trusted platform."
terrible experience. customer service is bad. products are not sealed and won't even take a return.
Very poor service. I received one parcel from nykka and that product was default and customer service executive not responding even they directly deny to coordinate with seniors . My monay as well time is waste very disappointed with this app . please dont buy any electronic products from nykka very cheap service and bad experience.
Misguiding promo codes. They lucrate customers with promo codes / offer and later do not honor it. Had worst experience.
Great experience
"Nykaa is such a fraud app. They always send the duplicate products and get the price of original products. How can they fool their customers like this.I had an experience & I never suggest nykka & plz don't trust them. We""ll be paying 2000,3000 etc for cheap products which would only cost 50-100/- ."
Good experience for nyka products
Great experience with Nykaa‚ù§‚ù§üòå
brilliant experience i love it
"Worst Experience from Nykaa. Showing false delivery report, but product not delivered yet. Most irresponsible website."
Not too good Before they started sending the orders through bluedart it was fine but the day they shifted their courier partner from Delhivery to Bluedart it really became terrible. Moreover their customer care is horrible and if you want to cancel any order its really the worst experience. So bcs of their service I really wish to give -1 otherwise the products are good.
"Worst experience with this app.. I had placed an order with prepaid 
transaction,i had afterwards cancelled the order for some issuses,but there 
is yet no refund statement issued on my app neither i got any text messages 
regarding this.. Worst team ever,i want my refund soon."
best experience ever
Awesome experience with Nykaa.. This is my first shopping with Nykaa.. I have read many negative reviews about this app.. But trust me friends all words are just meaningless. I am full satisfied with Naykaa.. Got great discounts on all products.. All products are original.. I am very happy to see the packaging.. It's just awesome... all over my experience is very good. Thank you Naykaa..
Satisfying app good experience
superb experience
Worst experience ever!! I hv cancelled one order because they delivered wrong product and the refund was initiated on27feb2019 but still i hv not received my money back.. Don't ever use this app... I am even unable to call the customer care as no contact number is provided at their site.. U can only chat but problem will not be resolved.. I lost my 480/- for this app.
Nykaa plays cheap tricks They sell products that are going to be expired on discount.. when we try to return or replace they cancel our request... Worst experience with nykaa...
good experience shopping at nyka
"I had a Very bad experience, its a fraud , not at all a user friendly , can't cancel the order even before shipping ,where as other apps provide good services, once if u made a wrong order and u prepaid the order then its gone , u can't cancel and no return and think that ur money is gone I suggest better go and buy any cosmetics from store itself or go to any good app but don't fall for nykaa"
It was a nice experience
Best stop to buy make-up & skin care products and so many other things as well. Hassle-free user experience. Original products and fast delivery.
One of the best app to purchase the online itemsüòä Go experience it!
Good experience.

Always a good experience!
I simply love NyKa as they give me better experience than shopping in person. Keep up the great work!
good experience but shipping is free only when cart value is above 500 that can be better
Very worst service if you guys return something then they don't make any refund to u . The worst app ever .. I have very very bad experience ..
"very Soothing experience, other Sites just promise but generally don't fulfill their promises but Nykaa is very Genuine, I would say, everyone should go for it.. (my personal views)"
i have a great experience. Thankyou nykaa for giving us such a great deals in beauty products. Love nykaa
It was first experience with nyka and its very disappointing to say that it was a bad one. I have not received my product for which I have already paid.
"Really disappointed experience with nykaa I had purchased lakme absolute serum foundation but I had received open and used product, after that I had requested return for same product but it is rejected by nykaa. I humbly request all users of nykaa app don't by any product from nykaa app. They are doing fraud and sending used product."
Very good quality experience
Best shopping experience..Love Nykaa
nice shopping experience. good quality products.üòä
Awsm experience
Best experience ever
great experience
Very bad experience
Nice experience of buying on Nykaa
"First order from nykaa, very bad experience I'm following up for refund since a month you guys are least bothered. Worst product"
"I really like the products Nykaa offers. I just wish they would use no plastic or bubble wrap to deliver the package, otherwise it's a great experience."
Worst experience ever.. ordered Garnier BB cream opened a few days later it had watery texture.. clearly it seems that it was a used one and some one added water like substance to it.. sent email along with the pics but no action taken on the other hand they keep sending email mentioning that it can't be returned.. pathetic customer service.. you never know what kind of duplicate products they send..
Awsome experience with this always happy while shopping with this
"My experience shopping on nykaa was amazing .... Also they have awesome offers on your fav products!!! Loved it overall ,üòç"
Nice experience
Bad site one should never use it. They sent me empty bottle of loreal xtenso shampoo and mask and now from last 14 days not scheduling the pick up so that they won't have to give the refund. Bad experience. Wi never purchase anything from nykaa again. Don't use the app. Fake products.
I love Nykaa.. all I have is good experience. You guys are doing a great job üíìüíì
"When I was new I had awesome experience with Nykaa but not anymore. They 
need to focus on their courier partners who doesn't contact customer and 
cancel the order without the permission of customer and delay the delivery. 
Worst Nykaa and worst bluedart they combined together for worst service"
"I personally have a good shopping experience with nykaa.I like the app for it's timely delivery, and good quality products as well."
Nykaa experience is one of the best online shopping experiences i have ever had
Nykaa is best for beauty... But only problem is they always choose a worst curior partner...blue dart## always got a bad experience... Late delivery... N no opsn of tracking... N fake help line no... Don't send my courier via blue dart#
My experience is good with nykaa...yes there's lots of products with discount and without..but its worthy buying through this app...
good experience with nyka......all time favourite
good experience

Good experience
I love to do shopping with this app and the products send by them meet my expectations it's a great experience to do shopping with this app if any how u receive expired product they will refund the money soon or they will exchange it
Very good experience
"Very bad experience, amount deducted from bank account even though transaction failed and the company is not at all refunding my money. Please do not use Nykaa,they only Rob money from customer's account."
It's a great experience but the delivery period is way more than expected
Very nice app. Good range of products. On time delivery. Just love the experience of shopping here.

"This app is great...its trustworthy.so ppl enjoy ur best shopping 
experience with Nykaa‚ù§‚ù§"
Great shopping experience
I like shopping from your app and I really loved the experience. But the only problem is that it doesn't show out of stock for some products. Like when I try to add them in my cart they show that the product I was trying to add is not available.
Nyaka app is very nice products I Love makeup and my first experience shopping for nyaka amazing love it .....lvvu nykaa I love this products and discounts.....:)
"My experience on nykaa is just wow... Nykaa have always handed me the best original products, I have ever purchased ‚ò∫"

What's the point of ordering smtg wen ur courier partner will not deliver it my experience is really very bad about this app I ordered two times and he did not deliver it and talking in a very rude manner and automatically leave the status that I refused to take it what a joke why would I order if I will refuse without even trying plz nykaa handle ur delivery section to some reliable service hub
Very useful and amazing experience of using. Can't think of buying things from store now. The offer deals are really exciting.

"Hi my order is not delivered to me and it is updating that all the items are delivered. It was a pre paid order. I tried contacting nyka customer care but received no call back. Worst experience ever. The option of ""chat"" is completely useless when I asked where is my order it gave an automatic response that your order is delivered. I am unable to type anything. It seems as if the app wanted to ask and respond as per they wish and not concerned about the genuine issue bcz it won't allow to type"
good experience ...n its easy to find products that i want ..lub this app
I was supposed to get my products by today I did not get it . Even I have paid for the products . They did not even notified me about any delay of the delivery... This is the first time I have shopped with nykaa and this is the experience I got... I mean ...I don't know that I got scammed or not... This is the 2nd time I'm commenting they have even deleted my last comment too... Great way to fraud customers...üëèüëèüëè

over the app is good to use... Wide range of products available.. But sometimes products are damaged and there is no way we can get them exchanged or return them.. i had bad experience 2 times. Cannot trust Nykaa when you have gift someone the product directly.

awesome experience with nykaa always
"Its my first time order for myself a makeup kit , it was a nice experience to do so üíóü§çüíó"
"Overall nice app experience but expected delivery date along with each product/order would be helpful. Also, the wishlist doesn't update the deletions, please fix."
was great experience
wonderful experience. you can find every product there. nice cosmetic app. but giving 3 stars because in terms of discount it is not very good ! it convert 100 points into 1 rs ! last time i purchased 2000rs worth item and i only get 100 points for that and now i am again ordering i am getting only 1 rs discount! please do something about it otherwise it is one of the best apps.
"Iam not going to place an order in nykka , this is my first time and very bad experience, it's been a week and I still didn't get my order üò°, every time I got a message like consignee not available, delivery boy not even called me , and he is not responding to my call , and 5-6 business days are over instead I can get early delivery from other sites"

easy access to big brands.. nice experience while shopping with nykaa.
best makeup shopping experience. quick delivery .
"I bought 3650 worth of products from Nykaa. THE PRODUCTS WERE TAMPERED WITH. When you buy stuff from such a brand, you expect some genuineness. The seals were broken, and i don't even know if something else has been mixed with the products. Worst worst worst experience ever. Never again buying from Nykaa."
Good shopping experience..
Nyc experience with nykaa
"I ordered few items from this app,it was a prepaid order.But the product never reached me and on tracking it showed ""delivered"".I have contacted them through mail and chats but the only response i got through my mail is we will look into the matter.And my friends too had a very bad experience.I am utterly disappointed with nyka abd their service,wish i could rate them 0.I do not recommend this app,beware of the fraudsters."
"Pathetic 1st tym experience .. i regret downloading this .. I downloaded 
application and than referred someone who inturn tried purchasing with 
referral discount .. but for some reason these guys have a very heavy 
security for such referral discount as they dont appear automatically while 
making pur hase but they want me to all them send email requesting for same 
as it takes more than 24 hrs for same and even after 24hrs no response 
..tried calling them still no better experience agin asked to wait another 
24 hrs .. so i started to belive that i was born to wait for 24hrs so that 
i can shop with tgese guys Dissatisfied"
It's a good experience on the whole specially their own products the Nykaa one's.. there are varities to choose..
"worst experience, will never order from this app."

I hope it ll be my good experience..
Nykaa is my go-to place for cosmetics. Trustworthy. Genuine products. Wide range. Aesthetic look. Convenient app interface. And the best part is they deliver so fast. Their prive program is good too. Only problem is the return policy. I could never return even one single product. That's why I took one star away.
Superb experience

Amazing experience
till now i had a good experience shopping with nykaa....
"My experience with Nykaa was good, however recently it disappointed me a lot! E-commerce is still active in my state with every product being delivered by other online platforms, yet Nykaa canceled my order even when the product had reached it's delivery destination. Highly disappointed."

"Very unreliable service. Would never shop again here. Better options available with committed deadlines. Updated..I have written to the support and spoken to the customer service team a day ago, they are absolutely clueless about the status. So they are reaffirming my experience that Nykaa is not the place to shop EVER !!!"
Rapid paymemt method which is ghastly secure! Awesome experience.
"""Best shopping experience till date..."""

"It's good so far... I order almost all the products from Nykaa but 1 bad experience made me give 4 stars. Once my parcel was tampered and my products went missing, but Nykaa took almost 1 month's time to investigate and re-address this issue.!"
my experience with Nykaa is awesome.. good quality product.
Bloody cheap & fraud products.... Very worst experience with Nyka..
good experience üòá
It is an awesome app. It's just a cosmetic shop at your home. Interface is awesome and app is made beautifully. Every product is available here. Just loved it!!!!!!
Horrible customer service....i complaint so many times that bluedart is not delivering me the product ....they gave me false assurance it will be delivered within 24 hours.... however after 9 days of waiting....the product is not delivered...infact it's returned back....i have never experienced such a pathetic customer service. I had been a regular customer. This was a big disappointment for me.
Decent interface. App hangs often.
Nice experience üòäüòäüòäüòä
It has been a wonderful experience shopping from nykaa. I got all d products on time and all d products are good.
Best experience so far
"Fake reviews of products on nykaa app. Unlike amazon, reviews of products are sent to moderators, who will review and approve. So they are not fair. You will see that most of the products will have 4 or more ratings. Its just fake. Also, many times you cant rate delievery experience."
Awesome experience buying products u like ...at such amazing prices
My experience with Nykaa is truely very good.....It is a trusted shooping app...They send exact products with perfect packageing n withing a very short period of time...and they give offers throughtout the year...so it can b easy sometime to buy desirable products...I am completely satiesfied ‚ô•Ô∏èNykka.
Worst experience with nykaa they have original product but they sent me a damaged product and when I applied for a replacement they again sent me that damaged product only not gonna shop again with this app
Excellent experience
Nice experience
I had amazing experience from naykaa
"My order has been out for delivery since 21st Oct, it's already been 5 days and there is no sign of it. The delivery agents are lying and saying they're unable to contact me when they haven't even tried! Nykaa customer care is just as useless unable to track my order. Worst experience. Useless app"
"Nykaa made me not to buy products offline. My experience till is really 
nice with NYKAA. Its easy to use. Customer Reviews, Product Descriptions, 
Shade Checker etc all help me to buy every new products on great discounts."
I hate nykaaüò†üò†üò† i ordered first time the seal of all products have broken bad experience
"Worst experience ever... They are all scamming... I should not have order anything from nykaa, I should not download nykaa app,,, I trusted them and I paid online, now that courier guy didn't delivere my package , he took my package,,, and worst part is after calling customer service they were telling me that I already got my package,,, it might be small amount for them but not for me,,, im so disappointed by their service. Now I'm regretting for ordering on nykaaa"
good experience
The customer service of nykaa is pathetic. There is no option to cancel an order once you placed and no return option after receiving any parcel. For such help we need to call them or chat only. And if we raise any complain they will not follow the customer properly. We just need to wait and wait only.I Am raising my return request from past 5 days but no response from these guys.They don't give any answer by mail also. Very bad experience.
Been using this from past three years.. experience has been improved..i love shopping from nykaa.. complaints are handled very politely and refund i got within few days.
just waooooo üòç experience
Amazing experience
It was Amazing Experience with Nykka The product was Really Original and Order was on time .Hope to shop Soon from Nykka

Good experience..

It provides really awesome offers and almost every brand across globe can be found. I have a really great experience till now.
"Amazing experience , nice app"
The app is pretty good. User friendly interface and great offers. But one issue that I have faced is that the orders update are not getting tracked properly. When I call the customer care they say that the order is dispatched but in the app it is still not showing. I hope you'll can fix this.
Amazing experience
Installed using my friends referral link. Neither me or her got any of the promised credit to purchase. Bad experience.
It is an best experience to shop from this app. I just loved it .
"Very useful app. Delivery experience is really very good. Authentic products. The only problem is its return problem of the profucts. But otherwise its really helpful. Its like an addiction, so be aware of itüòú(Jokes apart).."
Great user interface here!
"Amazing experience, always."
"Horrible app, products are definitely good, but pathetic customer service, never had this kind of experience with any other app, Buy only if you are 100% sure that whether the product is delivered or not you will be satisfied by paying up and wasting your money."
Been getting all my cosmetics and skincare from this app .It's truly been a great experienceüòÅ
Brilliant experience.
My experience is nightmare...I ordered the items before 10 days ..still not shipped.its a prepaid order.now they are saying they can't ship my items .they wil give me refund of my order since 3 days ...but they are not doing...their customer service is even worse ...they are cheating us
Till now what evr I have shopped from nykaa m literally satisfied with the product.. ü§óspecifically the quality of the product and with the delivery experience
Superb experience products are amazing
"I love this app that's why couldn't rate it as 1 star. Facing UI (user interface) issues since 1 week (checked my net connection also, it is very strong). I want to place an order but can't because the app is very slow to load. Please fix this."
It's been such great experience of mine shopping through nykka... there are so many exciting offers and discounts... and i love the nykka's hot pink sale...üôÇüôÇ
No experience because I m using this app first time
Good Experience
its always an amazing experience to shop with NYKAA
"It was ok earlier but this time i had very bad experience with nykaa delivery as no one came to delivery address and they already show that delivery failed and customer refuse to accept the order which are fake remarks,i talk to nykaa customer service and even then they did not deliver my order,very bad,pathetic service,i will never prefer nykaa again"

I used to love Nykaa before. But since they have cheated on me sending me cheaper products instead of the original one. I have no choice but to rate you one star. such a horrible experience with the top rated beauty shopping app. I never expected this

Beautiful experience with wide range of products of almost all companies with good discounts and reviews.
my experience with nykaa is really amazing
"I am not able to Log in. Whenever I try it says email already registered. Please login with you facebook account. There is no option to login. Also why is that if someone shares me a link of a product on whatsapp, instead of opening the app, I'm being redirected to play store. Bad experience."
great experience with the Nykaa...
"its very bad experience , they have delivered the wrong product im very dissapointed l..."
It's a great platform to get good skincare products. It's been a few years since I started using products from here and Nykaa always delivers authentic products on time. I'm thankful to the team for a seamless experience.

This app has all the essential for ladies. You can opt for so many brands. Great experience üëçüëç
"Nykaa is the best beauty app out there! There are fantastic deals, and the app layout is so user friendly and cute! The best thing about the entire app is the delivery time. They literally deliver your products in the shortest amount of time! The products are packed very neatly, and nothing leaks whatsoever. My shopping experience with Nykaa has been gorgeous! Highly recommend it! Love you Nykaa! ‚ù§"
excellent experience
"Delivers very fast . It's a nice experience, shopping with Nykaa."
Wonderful experience
Worst delivery experience with nykaa.
Awsome experience
Great experience with nykaa
"The worst experience with Nykaa Return policy. I has placed my order and as soon as I recieved it, I checked the complete jewellery I ordered. when found not appropriate according to product description I immediately the very next hour I put down the request of return. It's been more than a week the product is still lying with me with no update. first they need snapshots of the jewellery, then again a mail asking for bill, then again a mail asking for box and then again a mail for bank details"
nice experience with nykaa
Amazing experience with nykaa always!! Gradually the delivery experience is getting little poor..otherwise it's always hpy buying in nykaa
"Making a return seems impossible on this app. I ordered 4 night suit out of which 2 were not upto the mark. It's been 2 days and still not able to make a return request. They are asking for the bills and all. In Amazon,first cry and myntra the return is much simpler without even a question asked. Poor experience."
vry grt experience each n every shipping ‚ù§‚ù§
its awsome i love the shopping experience
My experience with nykaa is really good. They provide genuine product and also have recommendations for your concerns. Great app.
I ll share my experience once i receive my order.

good experience with nykaa
"I am reviewing my review. Because of my bad experience last week, ( which is not yet resolved) I am downgrading the stars to one. I ordered for Olena collagen powder (300 days supply) worth Rs.4180/- on COD. On receiving the package, I paid Rs.4180/- . However on opening the parcel, I was shocked to see N95 face masks worth Rs.1384/-. The invoice inside the package is addressed to Ramya Prabhu in Bengaluru. Despite have placed a replacement request on 19th, the issue is not resolved."
"The worst experience ever, I ordered the product and it was delayed 10 days 
and I didn't even receive the item and the status is updated as delivered, 
the customer care is the worst no one is there to note Ur complaint and 
when u do find someone there is no follow up on Ur complaint, never going 
to shop again with nykaa....."
"Great experience shopping on the nykaa app. It is really simple and makes checkout super easy. You find most of the products here, checkout their luxe section too, authentic products."

Initially i was having great experience with you guys..but with my last item had worst experience..you have delivered me wrong size product and the return policy for the item was valid only for 5 days..which is very less..but the main thing is that when asked you the solution for the same on tweeter you have blocked me from there even without a single reply..atleast you should have reply..how could you block someone without any reason..i haven't used abusive language or something like that

I won't even give one star..they are frauds in the name of offers they take money in one or the other way..I would just share my experience in .I ordered few products sum total which came was RS 1800..n j paid also..when i received the product and saw the bill and realised the total bill was 1500 only ..i mailed my complaint but no action was taken..they just send me computer generated sms.. Not trust worthy..
"Really really bad experience and worst service. Ordered things but didn't receive it, didn't get any response on complaints too. Cancelled the order and even that was not being initiated."
Loved experience. U can customize ur skin hair .what stuff u want.ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©
"It was the worst experience of buying any product from here. They have worst return and refund strategy. It's a humble request to every user please don't buy anything from this app, if you buy u will definitely soon understand why I am writing this review..poor service, poor size fitting problem, poor delivery time, poor customer care response..deleted app from my mobile."
Very poor.... horrible experience with the chat box...and I was not able to cancel my itemsü§∑

Good experience nd..one of the best site for cosmetics.. love u nykaa
fun experience using this app! awesome for beauty products.
"I had a very bad experience as a new customer with Nykaa. Ordered a product on discount and after around 15 days of follow-up, the product got returned as the courier doesn't ship for my pincode. When asked for reshipping with different courier, Nykaa was not ready to do it and asked me to wait for refund and order again - where my previous discount would not be applicable. Nothing done for customer satisfaction. The customer service people are so rude in the way they respond."
Overall good experience
Best offers and discount. We get trusted products. Really good app from personal experience.
"My 1st experience with nykaa went extremely well.. the packaging were so good and the products are original, Keep up the Good work.."
Just love this app Had a great experience all the products of your choice are available here at great discounts
wonderful shopping experience with Nykaa... On time delivery. good quality of products....üëç great app...
"Wonderful experiences....... always happy to shop here and very satisfied 
with service and quality... Thanks NYKAA ....keep it up"
"The most horrible online shopping experience ever. I placed an order for an eyeliner worth Rs. 550/- and received a kajal worth Rs. 70/- I still don't believe how they could deliver something completely different. Please be aware people they are highly unprofessional and don't really have a structured shipment policy. When i contacted Nykaa customer support they told me to click pictures of the product I received only after further investigation they will process the replacement of the product!!! that will take 15-20 days for sure, delivery of the wrong product itself was almost 10days, so basically more than a month to deliver a simple item. After shopping on Amazon, Myntra etc., I regret even downloading this app."
My experience with customer service Arshaan was very smooth and helpful.
Best shopping experience.
all over experience is very good the best app i can tell for cosmetic shopping but the only problem is returning back option is not appropriate
"amazing experience so far. genuine,original products with great deals. highly recommend nykaa for make up shopping too."

Current policies are the worst policy I've ever experienced. The first thing that a customer can't place his oder below 299. And the second thing they will not accept cash on delivery below 700.
Great experience
worst experience now I'm facing..... I have requested a lot of time to re attempt of my delivery still there is no response from nyka...!!! I have mailed but there is no reply what can I do?
great experience. wide range of products. affordable rates. helpful reviews enabling one to make the right choices
"After buying a hell lot of products from their app i got a damaged product sugar mettle lipstick mimosa. Their support team kept on arguing that its in prime condition. No replacement , no refund made. Very poor customer care. Its ur luck if u get good product else they wont take any responsibility. Very very bad experience on top of it i being a prive member still no help given."
not able to see the placed order 1st EXPERIENCE very bad....
Very interactive User experience
Nykaa's app provides a quick and efficient shopping experience.
great experience
Great experience
I love to shop with nykaa.But in my last order they send me a almost expired product. And they cannot see this matter even after my complain.. AFTER MAILING THEM MANY TIMES I COULDN'T GET ANY RESPONSE. WHEN I CALLED THE CUSTOMER CARE THEIR REPRESENTATIVE SAID THAT THEY WILL l SEE THIS MATTER IN 24HOURS. NOW 4DAYS ARE OVER BUT I COULDN'T GET ANY CALL OR MAIL FROM THEM. But I have to say that I will never shop from nykaa again after this harassment. Worst experience with nykaa.üëé
I have had wonderful experience with this app and have been using past few years now. Even if I faced any problems with products they refunded the money. The best part is at times estimated delivery is of 5 to 6 days but they deliver within 2 days.

"Good selection of international and homegrown cosmetic brands with great deals. The interface is also user friendly, and I particularly dig the 'try it on' feature for nailpaints which allows one to see how a colour would look on different skin tones. Also, the description with each product is well written and informative and helps one make decision. Great going, Nykaa!"
First time I ordered...and I never gonna order from it again..worst  experience..so late delivery...

"Please please do not buy anything from Nykaa. Their service is worst. My order is delayed by 20 days and still they are not ready to help and asks to wait for 3-4 days more. In addition, now that products are useless for me and they are not ready to cancel the order. Worst experience i ever had. Already uninstalled. Myntra and Amazon are much better than this. I received the products from other apps within the timelines. Too much disappointed. No value for customer."
Superb interface.... All together awsome experience.. Loved it!!
Great Experience. You find absolutely everything you need and it's so user friendly. The entire experience is hassle-free.
Never buy anything from Nykaa. Worst online shopping experience. They don't deliver in time...not even after complaining thrice. They don't care for customers a fig. And the tracking links don't work. So here it is...no shopping with Nykaa...ever.
Great experience...specially the virtual mirror..helps u find exactly what product u want
"Very bad experience I have ordered Biotique Natural Makeup Magicolor Lipstick - Red Velvet But the piece is broken and used When i try to return lipstick the said ""For safety reasons,we are currently not accepting returns on any order"" But when we receive order can you follow safety instructions"
Osm experience every time with nykaa
Good experience. Got the appropriate information regarding my query by afshaan !!! üëç
"App User interface is very good, but I think you should provide consumers to upload products real images with reviews( like Amazon or flipkart) when they got and used that product bcz it will make more ease for new customer to buy or not to buy."
Recently started using the Nykaa...very convenient to use...recent experience is good.
Amazing experience with nykaa..loved it..
It's awesome experience shopping with nykaa
Trustworthy.. An app that maintains all orignal products and ofcourse having a great experience shopping on it..‚ù§Ô∏è
Very nice experience

"It doesn't even deserve 1 star Plzzz don't buy anything from here, I have experienced their service. First I placed order, the order never came and when I demanded for refund then they said that I don't have any order, they are even trying to steal my money, I  even tried to call them but no one is answering and they are even cancelling it. So plz be careful!"
always a great experience
Good experience
Good experience
It is a nice experience
Worst experience ever I ordered one foundation but they sent me three and charged me for three even though I had not ordered three and when I tried to return the product with relavent pictures of the product they didn't take the item back
User experience is very good and seen many cosmetics which are not available in other apps
It's always a nice experience with nykaa
trustworthy and elite shopping experience
Good experience till date
Love the app idea in general and the discounts but the app performance and user experience in general can be improved. The app hangs sometimes.
fabulous Experience
my experience using nyka is good
Amazing experience
Really had a very bad experience of purchasing Dove 1 ltr shampoo....itz duplicate üëéüèªüòèüò°
"Nykaa has got a wide variety of products under reasonable rates. Compared to other sites, it has got better surfing experience, and greater offers which makes me choose it over others. A small suggestion from my side would be that if you will mention that which product would suit best for the particular complexions then it will ease for others during purchasing."
Dont buy anything from Nykaa because they dont have good delivery partners. i am telling you my experience with Nykaa what happened with me. There was pink sale during this sale i ordered some items but i didnt get the items the delivery partner ecom express was daily sending message that your order is out for delivery but at the end of the day mostly evening again i get message your address was not found or sorry its not deliverable like such silly excuses but in fact they didnt attempt deliver
Great Experience
Nice experience & fast delivery üòÄüòÄ

"Nykaa delivers genuine products. For cosmetics, you can always trust this app. I have been ordering since 4 years from nykaa and there was no single bad experience. When I tried other apps for cosmetics, I found the products were not genuine. But with nykaa, we get genuine sealed products with proper packaging. Keep up the standard üëç"
wonderful app.good experience
"Disgusting! I haven't had such experience with any shopping app. I ordered some things on 1st June and some of them I received but the some are reached my area but didn't deliver yet. Every morng since 7th June I get msg that order is out for delivery but in evng they send that could not deliver and consignee will collect from office. But I didn't get any call about asking me such or asking address. Same happened on 8, 9, and 10 june. I complained so many times but same thing is happening.."
Awesome experience so far

It was an wonderful experience. The product are original n their delivery is quite fast.
Totally easy to use and very satisfying experience
Never had any bad experience
Its like having all the superb brands at one site and at one click away. superb delivery and shopping experience. ordered many times from Nykaa and never diappointed . would definitely recommend.
Never gonna shop again from nykaa. Worst return experience. They will send you the wrong product. They will keep telling you to upload more photos during the return process. And even after doing so no change no review. Now my return is rejected. They don't deserve even a single star.
You get all the authentic products and the honest reviews too. Though one time I did received a used product and couldn't return it. Otherwise I have always had best experiences with whatever products I have ordered.
overall experience is good till date
"One of the must have for someone who orders cosmetics online !! Amazing

Very Bad experience My first order get cancelled and I didn't get informed about it ! need to improve costumer care services.
Best experience ever had
Nykaa provides lots of variety and products under one roof and quality is also super. But one thing I wan'to say that as I have experience the products selected in my cart and which I received slightly different in choice. Please make sure about it NYKAA. üëçüòä
amazing experience words cannot describe
Very bad experience
"It is a worst experience to deal with this app, it seems Fraud application, I have ordered few things before 17 days but still I can't track my order yet, or now my order is not reflecting on the app, or if I want to cancel my order so no link found for cancelation. Even customer support system is not support or giving me satisfactory answer."
The best ever beauty app I have ever seen before.. Loved it.. I was feeling like such an experienced makeup person what I am not at all.. This is the best app for showing Janhvi your love.. There are all Janhvi choices.. You can easily choose and fill your woredroab Go and grab your offers!
worst experience ever don't want to shop again & don't want to recommend worst customer service & worst product they deliver product without seal open product & never try to help customers I was the one loyal customer but they didn't help me when I raised complaint about without seal product & they did not return that product don't want to shop again & don't want to refer to anyone lots of online app available instead of nykaa hate this nykaa app never try to use again they are fraud.üëéüëéüëéüò°üñ§
"Very nice app with good interface , almost every product available , very good and fast delivery , very satisfied , my all time go to app , would recommend ."
very bad experience because I buy some product there was size problem I want exchange but they not exchange it..once I buy shampoo but I got duplicate product...üòù

"I had the worst experience with this app... Their customer service is sooo creep, we can never find anyone available for the issues... I wasted my 700 rs over some fake products by this app. Gosh! I just want to curse all of them. I'll not recommend this app to anyone."
wonderful experience
"My experience has been really good so far. Great offers and value for money products. Also, prompt delivery. Keep up the good work."
Great experience......i am a regular shopper from nykaa being a prive member i always had a gr8 experience and i am happy to share that for the first time i experienced problem in my hot pink sale order but team nykaa take it seriously and helped me delivered my order. Thanks team nykaa
"So far so good experience. Sometimes the offers are pretty limited but then this app is super handy, everything is just available at reasonable price. Good job, Nykaa. Happy me üòä"
every shopping on Nykaa has been a plesant experience.
nice experience...but coupons are not available for the best selling products
Every time awsm experience with awsm brands love to collect cosmetics Its really worthy app
"I ordered a couple of products on the 16th, however the status that it is showing even after 4 days is ready to be shipped ! quite strange considering my previous Nyka experience was quite good ! even their online customer service is of no help to follow up on the status..really disappointed !!"

"My experience with nykaa in one word- ""amazing"""
wonderful experience. always get authentic products. no duplicacy
Worst shopping experience... They didn't deliver my product and its obvious that they are not refunding any.... Much disappointed... And to all these they have a common reply - hey what is your problem kindly email your problem @ dis dis... I wonder why this app has 4.5 rating.
"My overall experience with nykaa is quiet fine. No duplicacy with the products, if there is any problem with the product, it can be resolved easily. Thank you nykaaüòä"
I had a very nice experience with nykaa in terms of refund...Very fast refund processed...also very nice offers..üòä

Best experience
very nice app with friendly interface
If you want to return something...... it's impossible...... awful experience
"mostly all brands are available, shopping experience is good with Nykaa"
"Nykaa ...they cheat the customers. I had ordered few stuff and on delivery when I opened the packet, few of my stuff were missing for which I had already paid.When I asked them about it then didnt even respond . No reply to my emails and calls. Such horrible experience. They took the money and didnt even deliver my products. Consumer court is my last resort.Big Zero. Don't recommend at all. Disgusting."
It has been always a outstanding experience to shop with nykaa one store which provide u with several brands under one click thanku nykaa üòò
"Worst experience with this app, the product is not delivered yet and the status of the order is delivered. I haven't received any orders nor any guy has come to deliver, I mean wow! This is the worst service of anything, also tried for the return request, that also rejected without any verification. And the customer support is useless, no response from them. They actually don't care for their customers. And Important! don't do prepaid orders. I suggest please don't use this app and products."
Great experience! Great offers as well
Good experience.

I will not use this app anymore..

very good experience
"very good experience with nykaa ,i love this app"
I have a great experience with nykaa regarding delivering price offer...
I am having very poor experience with nykaa.they delivered wrong product to me and now after so many complaints they don't refund my paid amount.Now I don't want to buy anything from nykaa because of their poor performance.
My experience with Nyka is great!! Thanks Nykaa for your love and making me experiencing new products.
"The most pathetic customer experience till date. They took an order 15 days back, every second day you receive a message the order is out for delivery. But no sincere effort to make the delivery, neither a single call or email. Even after multiple calls and emails , the support team cannot even get the order delivered nor cancel the order. It has been worst experience of all online shopping sites. More like a customer harassment, won't recommend Nykaa to anyone."
good experience
Very bad experience... Worst customer service... Will never shop from Nyka... Had spoiled My big day... And still long time they are not responding...

Ghtiyaest app in the existence of app.... Delivery hoti nhi or prepaid orders lege... Guys get fake products shok se but never order from nykaa trust me its a personal experience
Omg pathetic delivery experience . Delivery persons r pathetic several times they call and harass . After cancelling my order they call everytime disturbing and tell to take the parcel. Even nykaa cus. Care itself call also telling them the same thing they r harassing . No manners how to talk to the customers. Patheic and crazy delivery idiots.
my nykaa experience has been totally amazing till now‚ù§
Till now experience is very good
amazing user interface
It's a hassle free experience till date.
Satisfying experience each time‚ô•Ô∏è Need not to visit any other site for ordering cosmetics or skin care stuff...keep up the good work...
products are good but the delivery experience was bad with me
nice experience with nykaa... i love the discounts here and there delivery too
"Great shopping experience ,ü§©‚ù§Ô∏è best app fr beauty products."
My experience was nice but prices r high
App is good.-..i would just appreciate the fact that on my complaint these guys refunded my entire amount and picked up the opened product frm me although i did not use it..authenticity is definitely guaranteed....so it was overall an overwhelming experience..... i would definitely wantmore of offers and discounts -.-.-..its a great site
Good experience with nykaa Genuine productsüëç
"seamless shopping experience, would love more offers though!!"
Excellent experience ‚ô•Ô∏è
I have tried paying by upi and from there end there was a problem my payment was not processded and i lost my 1st order 10% discount and my 813 rup also worst experience using nykaa app
"If you are not relying on the product reviews which from my experience with 
the app seem very very fake and contradictory to my experiences, then it is 
fine to ordee from here. The delivery and packing is quite good. But the 
reviews are very misleading. Remember to open the package within 5 days of 
receiving it or you wont be abke to return it. 7 out of 10 times priducts 
are sealed. There have been iccurences at times where you'll wonder if the 
priduct has been used like my crayon lupstick experience recently that came 
in without its accessory."
Good experience.... Bought twice.... Got genuine products üòähappy shopping üõí to all nykaas! However I would like better deals on products like that offered in purplle...
Great experience
Its a Great experience to shopping with naykaüòöüòö
Bad experience. Always different colour than the chosen one.
One of the best online shopping experiences!
gud experience
"way too bad experience with returns and refunds. ordered one product of zivame from Nykaa and the product received was missing. Placed replacement request way too long back and still there's no update. had to mail customer care even then there's no response. When called seperately, customer care team says that zivame has to approve the request then only we can do something. Never expected this hassled process from Nykaa."
Excellent shopping experience till date.
awesome experience
it is an amazing experience. shipping services are very nice.
Good experience
Nice experience
Very good experience to get all the products in one place
"Worst delivery experience. I wish there is an option for marking zero i would have selected that. The order was placed on 27 May and since 03 June the order was kept at Gurgaon hub. When i tried to contact the delivery team, the call only goes through IVR and does not connect. Also when i called the Nykaa team 5-6 times there answer was the same everytime "" We have informed the delivery team to deliver the product asap"" and we have escalated the matter to relevant team. Worst app and their team."
I love the genuiness of products n fastest shopping experience with nykaa.... So much so far... Best one üëçüëç‚ù§Ô∏è
It's been a hassle free experience. But just want Nykaa to have good discounts n coupon codes not by particular brands but in general discounts
Great experience each time i shop
Good and friendly experience.
excellent experience
Nykaa has given me a wonderful experience when it comes to cosmetics. This is one application where you have cosmetics and brands from all over the world and you never ever get tired of browsing. Good thing Nykaa has introduced a point system. Now I don't have to go out to any shop physically and buy stuff because I get it at the tip of my fingertips üòÉ. Thank you so much guys.
Amazing experience always
Very bad delivery experience. Many items go missing on the orders and they say that we can't lodge a complaint after five days. I was waiting for the item for long and They use this trick just so that we won't get any refunds back.
wow experience
"Sticking experience... Cheap return policy... N customer executive are illiterate, repeat same thing on every call ... N don't try to solve ur problem n make laugh on u ...i request to return my delivered order but no one take it serious.... Every time nyka says plz again submitted ur return request n attach the picture of products.. But there is no response ...i request 10-20 tyms so plz.... Improve your return policy or plz remove easy return policy ..Very disappointed üò†üò†"

"Great app, I have always had a good experience with Nykaa. I am rest assured products are original and brand new just like purchased from a store."
So many products to choose from. All authentic. Its a good experience
Good experience Great offers

First experience is bad for product is not good melted lipstick received after many argument it got refunded but more improvement required
"My worst online shopping experience, very poor services. i didn't get my order even after 1 month, and i tried to contact several time but didn't get any response, i didn't get my money back too.üò£ i am very much disappointed with the response i got. even after getting ditched earlier , i have gathered my courage to buy something from nykaa again. please let me assure i will get my order this time and you people won't cheat me this time, otherwise be ready for legal action against nykaa."

My experience with Nykaa is great
Great experience fast delivery what else we need always happy with this
very nice shopping experience....thank you nykaa üëåüëçüëç
The only problem is they don't restock out of stock products quickly. I have waited months for a particular product to be back in stock and they don't do it. Otherwise its a great app for getting top notch makeup and accessories.Genuine quality. Also great discounts available!!! Overall hassle free shopping experience.
Delivery system is very bad.. Package doesn't arrive on time.. Very bad experience.. They keep on changing the delivery date.
Good experience
Good experience shopping with nykaa...
"Had a pleasant experience with my first purchase, package safely arrived at my doorstop within 4 days. Would love to see a wider range of brands and products in the future, especially K-beauty. One concern though, the app tends to be malfunctional whenever theres a sale going on, particularly on the launch date of that sale. You just cant view products at all and would just give you a ""Something went wrong"" screen no matter how many times you refresh the page or app entirely."
Bad experience
"Worst experience you will have with their shipment partners. You will never 
get products on time and not even sure whether you will get it or not ."
Worst app. Worst experience as a customer.
Great experience of shopping
So far good experience üëç
"My go to for anything related to beauty... Be it for skin, hair, makeup or just any other skincare or haircare tool and even more, Nykaa is where you should head to. And with all the newer brands they add every now and then, Indian or otherwise... The options are limitless...As for the app it has an extremely easy user interface. So go shop your heart out on Nykaa!!!!"

i have a good experience with this app
easy app and quick payment interface
it was a very nice experience shopping with Nyka
great experience
"Shopping on Nykaa is a great experience..So far I have ordered lipsticks, nailpaints, face creams on Nykaa. The products are genuine. Nykaa is worth trusting..Go for it.."
When i odered o3+ professional products there was a offer on puchase of 1200 more will get a facewash free..i purchased of Rs.1403 but not received any free facewash..very dissappointed and bad experience..
"Very very poor experience, no data security, they use to sell the data to fraud people. Kindly not use Nykaa"
Worst experience with this app. I personally wouldn't recommend this app to anyone as their customer service is really bad and slow. I recently ordered 3 items from it and they had delivered one wrong cheap product in that(prepaid order). Even after generating an exchange request and sending them 7-8 mails they DIDN'T SOLVE MY ISSUE and closed my request ticket lately saying that they had delivered correct products. My order was prepaid and they didn't even delivered right products.Worst exprnce
"Very bad experience regarding refund of failed delivery.Nykaa is really bad at refunding your money,so always go for cash on delivery."
pathetic and pathetic experience
The worst app we ever had where if you have paid for the product online the delivery boys don't deliver the product n neither cancel the order. Worst experience really disappointed won't ever buy online from nyka
"Very Bad Experience.....it has been over 9 days but still didn't receive my 
order...The tracking order system is very bad.... contact with CSA Nd they 
said ur order will be delivered within 2 business days but haven't received 
my order till yet.... waiting waiting waiting"
Wonderful experience
great experience
great experience with wide range of products
Worst experience ever my first purchase and you guys delivered the wrong product . And my approval for return is still pending in ur app . I will never recommend anyone to purchase anything from nykaa. You guys dont have value for money as far as other people are concerned nither u have value for time . Very disappointed .
The best shopping app I ever experience and the beauty products are amazing. thank you nykaa for the wonderful product
Good experience
Loved the app. The interface is really user-friendly!
Great offers and great experience
Awesome experience
"I had a worst experience with nyka. They charge you full for your order but deliver the partial products only. I placed order during the sale n they dint deliver my lipstick. I initiated the query to customer support. They are even worst. They are giving me resolution from last one month stating wait for ""24-48Hours"" dont buy anything from nyka. They end up fooling us n then blaming us.and customer care is more lazy. Misled"
great experience
Great app. Best user interface. Original products only
v nice shopping experience
i have a great experience
Great experience shopping with Nyka... Genuine products...
They have huge range of cosmetics. Easy to navigate and accessible user interface. Must recommended for people who are lazy like me to go out and buy things.
It was a good experience you get all your fashion and self things at one place..... It is time saving also‚ù§Ô∏èüíØ
Awesome experience
worst experience with this app/site. These guys are very reluctant to take returns. For any return first talk to executive then mail various snapshots..still return will not happen. I will suggest everyone not to shop from this site.
It is a wonderful experience of using this app as a good way of shopping your branded products from office only without going to the market as well as i must say products are Genuine and Authentic. Thnkew Nykaa**
Awsome experience
I am really disappointed with nykaa i ordered two lipsticks and even paid for them pre paid for them but when they came the delivery man was asking for the money i was so disgusted and had to return it why would i take it if i have already paid for it and still had to pay for it again i want my refund i have taken alot frim nykaa but this timw is was my worst experience
Worst customer service.Still not got my order it will be a month now..and they have no answer to my questions.i don't understand how they work.if the customer executive cannot handle why can't they take advice frm a senior person.they just say it will be dispatched soon.how soon after a year?Also on chat they just play pass in the pass with agents n then the agents take 15mins atleast to know the issue n have unsatisfactory answers. Never had such experience before. Not worth and untrusty brand
Wow experience with nyka
very bad dlivery experience
"Worst experience ever!!! They never deliver on time ,just update the (my order)section by saying that the delivery boy is out for delivery .Yesterday He was out for deliver on 8:45am but it was 7:38pm and no one has reached us with the order till then.VERY DISSAPOINTING.Today again the message says that he is out for order but his phone is switched off,I am not getting the point of delaying so much.I must say that the delivery of this brand is really very very slower .pls cancel my order"
great experience. thanks
very good experience
Its bad experience fom nykaa .. nobody use this app .inki delivery service bahut bakwaas hai aur sath mein inka customer care centre customer ko support karne ki jagah apne delivery walo ko support karta hai .. delivery surface service worst services.. mam aapke address par pahuch gye send me otp now my order cancelled .. cheaters delivery surface wale and unko support karne wale customer care wale nykaa k ..koi bhi shopping mat kijiye yaha se ...
I'm happy to shop with nykaa It's wonderful experience üòä
"This is the first time that I have ordered on Nykaa. I am yet to receive my product, will share the experience after receiving it"
I got an amazing experience... All the product which l bought were superb and quality one... I suggest everyone this app for online make up products..
"Superb experience... ‚ô•Ô∏è It used to be nice but recently, Disappointing!!"
They r sending all the broken products... either the seal is broken or the nozzle....very bad experience I had ... n if u put for replace they r nt bother at all
Bad experience.. creams r half in quantity.. useless application
nykaa is superlative..the products..the interface..the deliveries.. everything is bang on..keep up the efforts.. appreciated
The experience was great. I have ordered some itmes for my friend. Hope for the best product delivery.
Nyka provides best beauty experience i love to shop on nyka.
Exellant experience of shopping. Very fast app and easy payment.
let me know about my first experience
good experience
"Worst experience ever. As per the tracking status, the order was supposed to be delivered by blue dart 3 days ago. The delivery status was marked ""consignee not available"" without attempting to deliver. Everyday when I call customer support, they ask for 24 hours to resolve the issue. 24 hours passes, I call again, they again ask for 24 hours. This has been the third time in a go, they have asked for 24 hours again. NO actions were taken. I am done with NYKAA !!!"
loved the experience of ordering from nykaa
I wish i could gobe zero star....for the serivve is totally poor ...no action is taken if there is a coustemer request ....delivery experiences is too bad Its about a month i didnt get my package and even after complaining no action
Awesome experience
My experience was really nice
Nykaa supeeer experience for shopping.Tq u r best Naykaa. love u.super shopping experience.Tq
Nykaa provides one of the fastest deliveries. The products are all authentic. I love shopping from nykaa. They make your experience worthwhile :)))))
superb experience
my experience with nykaa is very good.
You people are giving excellent service. But was a bit disappointed when couldn't find k√®rastase products. Otherwise superb experience .
Nice experience...good collection and reasonable price
Was quick and easy to loacte my products. Time saving experience.
Uninstalling it right away cz of the toxic workplace nykaa has. Really disappointed that a women powered brand treats its employees pathetically. Disgusted by reading all the experiences shared by ex employees of nykaa. I had a dream ti work with nykaa once. Reviews at Glassdoor saved me.
Best app for skin care I have a great experience with nykka
"Extremely poor interface when it comes to there features like chat and return or anything that is not helping them sell stuf.. The have a extremely poor customer service and they have made it even worst with there chat UI.. No chat records, no reply time display which is clever actually coz boy they take forever even.. just try returning of there ""easy return"" options or if by bad luck get a defective product and they will make wish that you shouldn't have installed there app in the first place."
It was nice experience ever.. All the time i been satisfied.. Like lot nykaa.. Happy to be with you.. Thank you
It is always a wonderful experience shopping from nykaa‚ò∫Ô∏è
I love this app... Very good experience.... Thumbs up for nykaa
Awesome experience
"Don't use this application. worst experience when it comes to returning product...Never Got a replacement or money refunded...So please think twice Before buying, Better to buy From a Store"
It's so good.if u love makeup then just go for it.Experience on your own.
Great experience
They deliver expired products and even after requesting for replacement they dont response. Worst experience ever !!
"Almost every brand is available here, best deals with good service. Amazing experience!!"

I love shopping with Nykaa. Very professional and efficient shopping experience
Good experience for first time
Great experience
"This is my first time experience in nykaa and like people say""first impression is the last impression""It's been one week I didn't received my products which i have ordered and surprisingly it received by a women in another location(place)which is totally different from mine..nykaa said that they'll fix this but it's been 5 days i didn't get any msg or calls..i have tried to tell my problems through emails and messages but still no response..loss of money..Thank you nykaa."

Great experience
Best shopping experience By far the best for cosmetics and make-up
"I have been ordering from nykaa from past 3years. Delivery on or before time. Quality and packaging is excellent. Best site to shop for any brand. Quality of the product received so far is best. Saw few neative reviews like, not able to apply coupons. Kindly check on what products and for which brand its applicable. And also bag total excluding the shipping charges should exceed 500 after that only free shipping is allowed. Will suggest the ppl to go for it, you will have an amazing experience"
The overall experience is hassle-free

friends"
Amazing experience

Plz deliver fast because 2 months back even though I did not cancel the order the only messages I received was that i m not available at the time of delivery...and the delivery was cancelled even though I did not cancel it....Please see that this time i have a good experience..Thanks
"They treat their delivery partner wow express neb sarai as god, will never forward any directive to them, even i case of delay delivery. My order is out of delivery from 2 days, still nykaa is saying my god will deliver to you in 4-5 working days. Wow lucky to order from nykaa first and last experience. Delivery office is 2km away, i am requesting them to get to main road wiz 2 min ride for them, and 10 minute for me still no response from them."
Amazing App. Easy to use. Great deals. Good Experience.
Nice experience using this app Cost is much reduced as compared to market
"First worst experience of all the online shopping apps that I used. I did not receive my products but the status indicates that they have been ""delivered"". Utter shame to the managers and their beloved delivering partners Ecom Express. Didn't not see a better way to steal money from people, royally. Keep it up and down. Hopeless PS: I uninstalled the app and I am going to tell all my friends and family not to use your app"
Good experience
Amazing experience
"The products are alright with good discounts, however delivery system is real bad with no proper support from team NAYKAA. Very bad experience shopping on this app. At the end it's no use if the products don't reach in time."

Great experience üôÇ
Worst experience . I ordered 2 item and it was said that it will be deliveredon 17th October the tracking detail says I am not responding.But I never received a call not even single message. What kind of customer response you are having. Atleast you can send one SMS with delivery partner number so that user can only reach.And there is no proper response for customer issue. Simply in app its mentioned raise your concerns.No update till today.I have done cancel now hope I will get my money back.
awesome experience
"Good experience with nykaa prices, hope products will also give a good impact"
My first experience was worst. As they say first impression is the last impression. In future will never make this same mistake again. The products that I received were all different than what I ordered. When I requested replacement the request was rejected. This is the first and the last time that I have ordered something from Nykaa.
Great experience

"Worst experience, they are selling products near by expiry date.. fraud!!!!"
Great experience while using this app.
Great App. Genuine products. Good Discounts. Good packing. Happy experience.
Worst experience...they deliver the items so much late that you can't even think.... They deliver it on the last date....written And in the evening or may be at night They don't care about the excitement of customer. I won't suggest the delivery service of nykaa to anyone
Superb experience

"I just ordered a Huda Beauty lipstick from nykaa the packaging was soooo poor,and they tried to scam us the Mrp on the product was 1650 and they marked it as 1825 on the website ( nykaa ap) the product will get expired in next 2 months and look what I've got a refund of rs 168 for getting fooled.was never expecting such a horrible experience that to with a well known brand likr nykaa!"
Amazing experience with Nykaa
"Worst experience with Nykaa. This app has lost its customer focus and service. Earlier I used to be a regular customer at Nykaa but my recent experience with them has made me uninstall this app. The order never reached me despite calling them, mailing them and raising my requests. The delivery executive just called me once and they returned my order without asking me. I will never suggest anyone to order from this app."
"I have been shopping from NYKAA for the last 2years and truely I have had an amazing experience. All brands under one is what makes convinient to shop. Need of any beauty related product, NYKAA is the first site that comes to my mind and anyone can blindly trust this. Thanks NYKAA"
my experience on nyka was pathetic i have ordered a lipstick nd when i got the delivery of that lipstick the condition of the lipstick was worst nd the shade of the lipstick was also totally different I am not gonna shop from this site anymore
amaxing experience.
Horrible experience with Nykaa i ordered thrice but non of my products reached to my address.... I called in the helpline but tht was worthless
Amazing experience with this app

I have good experience with thid app but am trying for one toner since one mnth but its still showing that out of service .....
It was really amazing experience
This is the first time I'm using Nykaa. The user experience on the app was good. Waiting to get my order delivered.
"the products and delivery is amazing but the app heats up and consumes too much battery. also i recently had a bad experience with nykaa, so maybe I won't shop again from the site but it is worth a try."
I have generally had a good experience with this up. Good job :)
Awsome Experience
a very good experience I addicted nykaa
Till now experience is awesome.... thanks nykaa
i have always had a great experience with nykaa so far..prompt delivery and the app is user friendly as well. however i feel customer support could be better.

I just love it..best shopping experience
It was a nice experience shopping for the first time.
good experience
"I have been very regularly ordering from nykaa. With my last order for the first time I received a broken product and a completely different shade lipstick. But my experience with the contact centre was nightmare. Ur support desk lady nikita was extremely rude, and when still I couldn't even ask my query c disconnected the call. Then I processed for chat and ur chat support Ms Priya, when I informed that I have swatched one product. I get a reply u should not have swatched if u don't like it, you should Google it before trying. Like seriously!! Your customer is facing inconvenience and rather helping them you ppl show attitude. Kindly take care of your support team or the dedicated customers like me will never come back, if attitude lyk dis is being thrown to customers!! Very disheartening"
"I had a good experience with Nykaa , their service is really good rather 
than other sites"
"awesome.... long lasting shades.. I am flight attendant from past 18 years.. I hv travelled across the world.. tried almost all brands but the moment I started using nykaa, its beautiful experience...."
"Very nice experience with this app it's very helpful for girl's üòç I always do shopping with Nykaa, I m totally satisfied with all my products. Naykaa gives a orignal product and time to time it's also give us discount and I Am Loving It üòçü•∞"

Nice experience
great experience... loved this app
"original products,,, less price,, awesomeüëè‚úäüëç experience with nykaa"
Hassle free shopping experience for me.THEIR APP WORKS GREAT.
My experience is v gd all products nyc
I think this is the best beauty product app ever 100% original and genuine product..this is my experience from last 1 year
Awesome experience... Authentic products... Fast delivery... Thank you NYKAA
Awesome experience. Nykaa is my first priority for cosmetics. Love it. Its products are up to the mark.
have ordered a few times from nykaa... good experience...
great shopping experience..you can find various makeup brands with great offers and fast delivery service. loved it
its a wonderful experience shopping on Nykaa. The collection is great and the products are fake.
Never experienced a delivery service faster than nykaa. And lets not forget about the product quality. Love Nykaa.
loved it. The order was on time. It was a good experience
Good option of products and great app experience and even super delivering practices
Products are good and genuine but don't fall prey to any offers. It was my first order and first experience of nykaa and as promised for my purchasing a 600 ‚Çπ gift (lipstick) was to be given to me but I got something else instead of it which looks like 200‚Çπ only.
My experience with nykaa is quite Gud actually. I can find all kinds of products here at reasonable price
I have had good experience so far. Looking for good experience even in future.
Best experience
Nc experience
Pleasant experience shopping here.
"Very good experience with this app, I loved it."
Having a nyc experience with this app
Amazing products and even more amazing online experience.
"They said easy return policy are available, but it is too difficult to return product. Worst experience ever and i will never buy anything from nykaa. and Please improve your assistant and return services."
Nykaa used to be great but these days they don't value your money or order unless it's above 2500. My personal experience sucked twice or thrice after they shipped my products and returned them to their own warehouse after it said your package is arriving late & not even giving us a proper reason why it wasn't delivered even after a delayed time period. They could've just simply told our order was not confirmed or shipped than confirming and shipping it to almost making it a possible delivery.
Good experience
"Unique experience, due to lack of promotion it couldn't become famous and you can get every cosmetic you could ask for....üòÅüòú"
I think this app is worst. Or just may be I had a bad experience. The service is just not satisfactory. They provide late delivery even when I chose for express one. They have less or no discounts on products than other apps. Some of my beauty products were literally expired.
I've very great experience with nykaa!!
I love buying beauty products from here always had a good experience
Good experience
Very bad experience with the app for the second time. In prepaid products neither the product is ever delivered nor do i ever get my refunds. Just fooling people around. And moreover no response from the help centre after so many requests..
Great experience üëç
Good experience
Good experience ‚ò∫Ô∏è ..... Like this app
"I am having a horrible experience with Nykaa. I placed an order for 5 products, most of the delivery has been delayed and one of the products has not even been confirmed, it's been more than 5 days. The payment for the product has been made and executives say that the product is out of stock. There is no proper management between Nykaa and their clients."
"Worst customer care experience! Nobody bothers to respond to issues raised. And the company charges for products and then does not deliver them!! I used to be a regular customer, but after this experience I will never order from Nykaa again!"
"The interface of the app is decent but there is a major flaw in the app. It shows you that an item is available, after you put it in your bag and enter all the delivery details, at the last step of payment it shows failed payment for a few times and then says that the product is out of stock. This happened to me twice. This is highly inconvinient and frustrating!"
Awesome experience.
"Good experience....My Life partner is Nykaa's Permanent Customer, she frequently does shopping from Nykaa and she referred it to me..I hope so I could also be permanent customer.."
Very bad experience ..wrost
"great experience. I am very very happy with the product and service system. they are really fast. well done. thank you so much , some of the products are delivered within 24 hr , which makes me surprise and happy. it's just wow. I wish such fast system continues with nykaa otherwise in India anything can happen once any brand or app gets popular ,sooner then they started degreasing. hope in future such things does not happen to nkyaa. my all friends are the big fan of nykaa and they love it."
Good experience.
Great experience with u
"great app for shopping,. order twice.. bt not any bad experience.."
"Such a worst experience! My product from Nykaa is supposed to be delivered today but courier agent (WOW Express Courier: Bangalore) says he attempted the delivery and coundnt deliver ( he didn't actually attempt to deliverat all!). I called him up and upon saying that I'd complain to Nykaa, he asked me go ahead, but he wouldn't deliver today. Such an arrogant lot of people over there and bad of Nykaa to partner with them.Tried calling customer care of Nykaa but they are very irresponsive."
My experience with nykaa has been awesome... I love nykaa ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
"Had a very bad experience with Nykaa, ordered a product considering description on their website and got delivered the product with absolutely different ingredients on the pack, containing several hazardous chemicals. After attempting to contact customer support service there was no reply and my review containing pictures with proof was deleted. Not reliable service."

"My Nykaa experience is great,I trust their products it's very good ,Nykaa's delivery service is also good , I'm buying everything from Nykaa, trust me it's very good beauty shopping app, all of your guys can try it.& I love it"
Worst experience.Customer support is just for name sake. I got two defective products. When i placed a return request..the refunded amount was not the actual amount which i paid. I haven't seen such policy..in which the customer has to pay for getting the defective product. Never going to use it.
I have most amazing experience with nykaa
best app. i have been using it for more than2 years. nice experience alwaya
First online shopping which i tried ..... Best ever experience ... thank you Nykaa...
Wonderful experience completely trusted site. absolutely original product. I love nykaa

"Once i had returned the product purchased , but did not get my refund amount, App said in process for return, and the guy came for pick up, didnt give any hard copy saying that they will update online ...and initially they did not respond to my complaint and few weeks later the app itself stopped showing my previous orders... Wonderfull experience!!!üò¢"
Good experience
The app is really slow and hangs very frequently. There is a vast range of products but not good surfing experience.

Grt experience shopping from nykaaüòò
on nykaa its very easy to buy a product at very reasonal price with good quality.very good experience i have with nykaa
experience was so good but one thing about this app is when we want to order the things less than 500 it can't give us the option of cod n i really don't like it...
"This is first time I have order from Nykaa & my experience is worst there customer support team didn't revert on mail neither they slove my quary on call it's been 10 days i am continually contacting them regarding my order they said it's delivered but I didn't received it, & proof of delivery which they send ther is no signature it's totally froud,, must be delivery partner didn't deliver bthe product or don't know but I am in loss and Nykaa don't have censern about it..

Amazing products at discounted rates! I always have an amazing experience while shopping at Nykaa. üíì
The app interface is good and intuitive. The offers though dont get applied or maybe there is lack of clarity on how some offers can be applied and that can be a dampener
Great experience with nykaa‚ù§
Love this app and it's service never had one bad experience
Amazing shopping and shipping experience
I have worst experience with nykaa. I didn't receive my package yet. The booking date is 5 August but still package didn't pick by client.. delivery date was 10 August 2020.

"My experience has been quite good.I get original products and im quite satisfied with the service, however things are not getting delivered in Dimapur ,Nagaland recently.I wish they start delivering stuffs in Nagaland soon.Overall i love this appüíõ"
Nykaa is having service ....v bad experience. Once they delivered expired product....who will apply the expired thing on their face???...n second time I got two same shades of eyeshadow pencils n that too broken....what will I do with two eyepencils of same color....thirdly I ordered pink shade of  lipstick n they have given me some brown shade...really unhappy n annoyed:(
Waiting for the first order to be delivered..I hope it will be a good experience.. Also Nykaa please bring in stocks so much in the site is out of stock..

nykaa ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"I initially liked this app when I was ordering only cosmetics. Ordered two 
bikinis on this and they did not bother to tell me that there was a problem 
with it. They only got back to me when I told them that I haven't recieved 
it yet. Recieved an email regarding process for request would take 3-5 days 
. But still no notification or has my money been refunded. Worst experience 
ever. Haven't recieved any notification despite emailing them as well."
Amezing experience i love did
I had great experience shopping with nykaa

Horrible experience!!! I would have given-0. They did not delivered the products ordered in ongoing sale and then asked to wait for almost a month without offering any compensation or refund!!! My paid order was delivered to other person's address because of their silly mistake!!! And the customer care person clearly told me that they will disconnect my call when I contacted them regarding the issue. What a shame!!
I have wondered experience with nykaa. All products I had purchased is worthy I love nykaa
good experience..
I don't have any complaints with Nykaa but I do have a lot of complaints with their Bluedart delivery service. I had a terrible experience with them and they harassed me a lot. Thankfully I had opted for Cash on Delivery so my money was not wasted. I will never shop with Nykaa again if I see that the delivery service is of Bluedart's. And I recommend others to do the same!
The shopping experience was great and most of their products are excellent.
great experience with nykaa
"Experience is good, just a little late delivery in one order."
My experience was so good

Loving the Experience and Amazing Offers ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Had a great experience with this beautiful nykaa app..loved each and every product. Always satisfied me with the good quality..
"It's a great app. Genuine products, customer friendly interface, amazing deals & fast delivery. The only thing I don't like about nykaa is their packaging, A lot of bubble wrap is used even for the products which are non-breakable, I hope they come up with better packaging methods which are more eco-friendly."
Always good experience
The products are very nice and the delivery is on time very good experience
I have not received my order yet whereas in track order it is showing out for delivery since a long back.. I have mailed the customer care twice.. There is no response... Where is my prepaid order? Either deliver it soon or refund my money.. The fraud site.... Worst experience.. Never gonna order from it again.
"Nykaa's delivery service has become very bad. I ordered 3 products on 25/10/19 but never got it , on 1/11/19 they messaged me that I will receive the order within 24 hours but the delivery service never called me,on 3/11/19 they informed me that the items could not be delivered. Worst experience ever. I also tried to contact their help centre but it was useless. Never gonna shop on nykaa again"
Very good experience on first order love you nykaa
Awesome experience but limited discount vouchers or coupons.... Thanks.
Good experience
Nice shopping experience
Amazing experience huge discounts
worst experience..!! i ordered a lipstick from maybline-smoky red and after getting the product i realised that the lipstick is not original. its a duplicate product with cheap plastic cover and a smelly lipstick inside. money waste.
great experience
If there is a option of zero rating then for sure i give tham a big zero. Very very bad experience with nayka
Amazing experience. The products are original and are of good quality.
Great experience
"I really loved the experience on Nykaa but one thing which I didn't like is that, when we share our link with someone else they avail 200 rupees. So whenever the other customer try to avail those 200 rupees they have to compulsorily order above 1000, which i think i not worthy. Beacuse when you say that you'll get it, you should."

Nice shopping experience
Good experience
"Never had one single bad experience with Nykaa for 2 years. Ordered a MAC mini Hydratant Lumineux and it reacted so bad on me n my friends skin. Cheek skin started peeling off in brown patches and continued to burn for 2-3 days. When complained to customer care, a sleepy lady called me up and told me ""Madam it looks like pigmentation"", you need to share a dermatologist report and more photos to take this forward. I was stunned at her attitude & then they marked my issue resolved! Wow!"
I love it. I get all my k-beauty stuff here. Everything's always been delivered on time. The only problem I've experienced is things being out of stock for a long time. But otherwise it's pretty good ‚ô°
"Worst service ever experienced with any e Commerce website. I received product with broken seal and product look old as well. I initiated replacement, that got rejected. Then no other option was there to report this. Then I wrote a review for that product mentioning the same, but they didn't approve my review and infact deleted it. Never expected this from such a famous website!"

Love this app. It's has a product for boys too.... Great experience. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
very bad experience .. ur delivery guy rejected to deliver the product for first floor .. and he cancelled the order byhimself .. respond to customer is not good
"I was nykaa lover. Bt some experience got worst. I ordered( not in sale with actual price) lip color from kiko milano which I found my favourite, and I reordered in sale this time I got totally different shade from previous shade . I think in sale they cheated on costumers . Now I'm so affraid to buy from nykaa. They denied to return in many ways . They have trap named sale ."
"Highly recommended, I have placed multiple order have never been unsatisfied. Great experience of shopping"
I m new to this app.let me see what experience i will get then i will give my view about this
Today 2nd Time I placed my order with nykaa.. till now good experience.. keep it up

The app interface is good and product ordering is also easy.
Good experience with this app
Awesome experience with nyka
Bad experience always high payment per cash on delivery available..ham student hain kha se har waqt 2000 shopping karu..so Flipkart best
"Its a wonderful app. Provides a great variety of options from product, some of the images take time to get uploaded, that is the only place I think needs optimization. I would also love to see some more international brand products on the site. I had a great experience and love the discounts. This is my first time so will update my review once the products are delivered."
Thanks Nykaa for wonderful experience of buying great products like Bioderma and Clinique online...products are genuine and u have great service...keep it up
Very bad experience. It has a lot of bugs and glitches. No update is available. It is really difficult to use this app because of the poor interface. I hope it will be fixed soon.
"The most disgusting online shopping experience ever. I ordered a Loreal compaq, Nykaa delieverd the wrong shade and they didn't bother to refund my money back. Girls if u order from Nykaa and they deliver the wrong product than be prepared they will never ever give ur money back."
"Bad experience! I never thought nykaa partners would be this irresponsible. How can they send a message to that i was requested a self-collect, FIRST OF ALL I HAVE NEVER DID THAT. And the delivery man was not even lifting my calls. He called me and when I was about to lift, he cut the call and now when i have called three times, they never lifted... It is my first order and i was expecting a good impression, but it all vanished now...i don't know when they will contact or i want to say never..."
fantastic experience.
Vry good products nd vry good experience Tnq u nykaa
"It's very bad experience for shopping,the company only selling products,but any defective product not given return or refund.cosmatic sending me Empty products,&not refund money It was very very worst experience ever...,do not buy from this nykaaüò©üò©üò©"
"Worst customer care, very delayed delivery of the products, they are non supportive over all worst experience buying from them....please think before buying"
Best experience
"I won't say it's worst but it's definitely not great. I purchased ""Maybelline Foundation"" From it that turned out to be fake (i know it is fake because i purchased the same from mall and the product mentioned ""made in China"" While the original product states ""made in USA"" ). Nyka also didn't show my ratings on this product even after submitting the ratings multiple times. I had the same experience when i purchased few lipsticks. They all were melt.Few products that i purchased were good though"
Good experience
Trusted brand products are available with lots of discount. amazing offers really appreciated..üòÉüòÑ I'm happy about my shopping experience.
its really good experience with nykaa!
horrible experience. ordered product but never received it. took more than a month to get refund..that too after multiple complaints and follow ups. uninstalled app today. BYE BYE NYKAA.
Good shopping experience and satisfied with the genuine products
Great App user friendly interface great variety of products and services love it.
It is a worst experience.My daughter order a product and they send a wrong item and now refuse to return or refund. Amazone is best. We have already mail you but your response was so unexpected..wrong item was sent to us and out item is sent to somone else..as you sais the other party didnot notify you you cannot refund us..is this our fault? This is totally a irresponsile matter by your side. I have never seen such irresposible despatch in online apps. Your app is deleted by us ..thanks ..
Amazing experience... Loved your packing more than the products I ordered... It was neat and elegant.üëçüëçüëçüëåüëåüëå

Very bad experience..worst service I have ever seen..I have ordered product and they had send another product..Even they don't know the order detail of customer..They send anything whatever they want.. and return process is very lengthy...worst service! Worst service! Worst service!
This was the first time I ordered from Nyka and it was really wonderful experience . I got everything I needed and during this hard period of covid I think this is the safest way to get desired product. Thanks Nyka... You made my day.
Lovely experience
"bestttttttt üòçüòçüòçapp ever tried for makeup skincare etc. go and check out now the lightning deals, offer s above 500, loved the 1st experience"
Experience can't get any better. Amazing offers daily! My last order was delivered in less than two days. You pack shampoos and deos like I ordered some mobile phone. Good Job guys!
very good experience..
Supar experience by the shop
They have all the brands right from drugstore to the highend. Plus easy user interface
Amazing experience using the app.
Bad experience.. I have ordered so many things from nykaa.. In spite of sending new products they have sent tester items(which is not for sale) and I have paid an original amount of every products.. Please return my money ASAP.  Otherwise I will take harsh action against this!!
Very Nice experience with Nykaa. Received my perfume within 48 hrs. Most important it's authentic. 2 thumbs up for prompt and true to their promised service.
User interface is very good and easy. It is quite easy to navigate and get the product. The products that I have received till now were all in good quality.
Awesome experience... Very fast service
"Dear nykaa, Till date i really hv a great shopping experience with u....& u hv improved yr app... u brought so many international brands to India....for that I'm really very grateful.... one request plz bring The Ordinary products to India.....plz.....it would b a huge favour...."

Always a very good experience.
Wonderful experience using the app.range of products love shopping in Nykaa
awesome experience...love you team nykaa..
"This app provides wide range of choices for a single product! Earlier , I didn't use to indulge myself in Beauty care products but Nykaa really got me hooked up to it :P Simply love the user interface! Kudos to the developers and UI Team :)"
"So far my experience has been very nice. Their customer service, quick and unbiased attention towards the customer's feedbacks/grievances are truly satisfying."
The 1st experience itself was horrible I faced delivery problems my order was returned without any reason ofcourse ü§êü§êüò§
i have nice experience with nyka
All products are original.good experience to nykaa.i love nykaa.
Good experience
it was very good experience with NYKAA üíï
I had very bad experience with Nykaa recently . I received wrong products which I did not order. Also there is no provision to contact the delivery person. I had to write multiple emails to return those products and get refund.
Awesome app and awesome experience!!!!
"Excellent product collections, fast delivery and great interface. 
Thoroughly impressed. But some products tend to go out of stock frequently. 
Please keep updating."
I am not sure if they are proving original product...my two time experience..the product which suits my skin when brought by nyka has started reacting to my skin...
"The interface,offers,product availability and range of products available is something I love about nyka except delivery of it as there has been past experience of inconvenience caused by delivery executives."
Reviews are meant for other customers to make purchase decisions and not a means of people to infiltrate into personal lives outside the Nykaa network asking more about the products that one uses. Unfortunately Nykaa facilitates this. Nykaa reviews have buyer's name written on top with Zero respect for their privacy. I had a bad experience after reviewing a product and requested Nykaa to delete my review or make it anonymous. They closed my request without any action.
Awesome experience üòç amazing app
"Worst Experience. I ordered products on 1 oct and had to follow up with help center team multiple time as my order was not delivered till 15 th oct. Their courier partner service is pathetic. They don't even call person to get the order delivered just change update on site, that person not available. No compensation given. No solution provided. I got answer that refund would be given after product is returned. What if a person needs the order asap??If you can't deliver product then mention this"
Very bad experience ! My order was returned even when I chose the reattempt of delivery option .
Worst experience. Nykaa has send me incomplete product.will never again.
"Horrible! Nykaa is the worst experience I ordered for so many products 
which turned out to be defective They are cheaters in the name of selling 
cheap beauty products"
I have an wonderful experience shopping from nykaa till date.
worst experience with nyka i'd placed an order on aug4 2019 and its not recieved yet....tried to track ma order and used to chat with the help centre its of no use
"happy with the shopping experience, but when I returned the products they didn't refund the money"
Great shopping experience üòä
Nice experience of products Thanks Nykaa
Awesome experience always.. Gud and trusted genuine products as always
Very nice experience
"they show false offers they say that there is offer on certain brand but when you try to purchase you will not find the offer, and their customer service is the worst i have experienced"
Very nice shopping experience
Bad experience . My orders option doesnt work can't track my orders . I have reported it many times but nothing is done
Very good üëç experience with nykaa.
Good experience ‚ò∫Ô∏è
my experience with nykaa is quite good. the description of the products help a lot to know the benefit of using the products u want to choose and packaging is so cute.. I love nykka.
Easy shopping experience
"Horrible experience...I have always loved nykaa but this time the delivery 
is horrible... I mean where is my product ..when I track order it said the 
product is delivered...I called their delivery partner they are 
disconnecting...such irresponsible people."
Loved the experience n fast delivery
Wonderful experience üíï
"Serving everything at one stop. Nice deals, good combos, countless brands and unbelievable offers with surprising gifts. It's a great experience shoping with Nykaa."
really good experience with nykaa it helps me alot to find my need thank u Nykaa :)
I have ordered so many times from Nykaa earlier their services were outstanding but since last 2 orders I would say was so unsatisfactory that I am giving a thought of not using it. Recently I have ordered on 25 July and my order is not even packed yet I and also there is no proper queries section where I can raise my concern...... Bad experience 3 star is only for the early experiences ‚òπÔ∏è
Nice experience
experience was too good.discount rate and most importantly fresh stock.
My experience with Nykaa is amazing till nowü§óü§ò
Great shopping experience and genuine products
Good app Return on time Overall good experience
bad experience because they provide bad service it was my first experience they delivered me damage product
I haven't received the product that I had ordered two months ago nor have I received refund for the same. It has been the worst experience with Nykaa as I called their support almost 10 times but to no avail. The support representatives shamelessly say the same thing every time I call them. All they say is they have escalated the issue. Pathetic support and poor customer service ever by Nykaa. Give me my money back Nykaa.
Like the user experience.. and most of the products that i look for are available.
experience is good
amazing App with good user interface easy to shop
Great shopping experience from Nykaa
Great experience

I m very happy to nykaa app because all products is original nd i love my shopping for nykaa experience lv u

Very bad experience.i never received the order .called the customer care 5 times and everytime they said your order will be delivered in 24hrs .highly disappointed üôÅ Edit: still not received the order in fact it got returned.placed the same order from Amazon .atleast they can be trusted unlike nykaa.
"Its the most horrible experience am facing with nykaa.If u guys don't want to deliver the order in any particular address then why the hell are u Guys taking the order?There is no use of harassing the customers in this way.I really don't understand what nonsense is going on?All other sites are delivering the orders to my house,why only nykaa delivery agent can't find the address?Then for what is the contact nmbr given?If you are not interested in selling then plz close it. I shld not evn rate 1."
100% genuine product. loved the experience. Using Nykaa since last 2years n still now jo complain. always received product on time everytime. Highly recommend.
Good experience
"it's a one stop shop for all the girls. From makeup to cosmetic, they've got a wide range of everything. Products are always on discount and delivery experience is wonderful."
It was indeed a very good experience

Nykaa is the bestest app I ever used.. the best part is .one can seek expert advice before placing any orders.. nd till now. M having good experience regarding the products I have been suggested.. thanks nykaaaaa
Nykaa is the worst shopping app Ihave ever shopped with. Poor experience with the return facility. They don't even consider the return request and address it on time.

nice shopping experience
nice experience
They don't even inform when the product is out of stock. Nobody from customer care replies. They just steal the money and don't deliver. Very bad experience!!
I've had a very bad experience with their return policy. They don't really take it seriously. Order only if you're sure about the product because they literally make you beg for your own money after they've picked up your product. I've been dealing with this problem for past 3 weeks and everytime I call them they tell me to give them more time. Very disappointed with nykaa.
Awesome experience of using Nykaa
Amazing experience. Loved all the stuff.
I had a really very good experience with this app its really easy to save your had earn coin. I love this
Great experience for first time !
Great Experience with Nykaa till now
"Such a pathetic experience. They sell items more than the MRP. When enquired, it is said that if you are really worrying about it, we might offer you ‚Çπ50. I was shell shocked. wanna take the matter to the consumer forum as under "" Consumer Protection Act, 1986 """
"Very bad experience regarding to the order status. They didn't give proper update to me. For 3 days they show preparing to dispatch, finally when i chat with chat support they said ""sorry mam it was cancelled because of the reason out stock"" . My questioning is "" why shouldn't they give update ""??? I felt to bad with the app. No proper respone.üëé Im waiting for 3 days for the order status . Finally waste of time . And i missed the offer time too."
From the past three years I was using this app to buy the things. Their services is really good and they will deliver the product as soon as possible. I am really happy to be a customer of nykaa and I enjoying my shopping experience with them than the any other online delivery app.
Great experience must try
Nice experience
this app is a complete package for the people who love makeup and skincare... it always has the trendiest products and is first class in service... addition and cancellation of orders are smooth... All over an amazing experience.
The only problem with this app is if u buy something below rs 1500 cash on delivery is not available nd btw good experience with this app
It was the worst experience with nykaa. They did not mention any detail conditions of returns during pendamic time. I ordered the wrong shoe size by mistake and they are not returning it. Although it was mention the ordered can be returned. I contacted the customer care and they did not help me too.
awesome experience loved it
"good experience, all genuine products"
"Good experience, good service!"
"I've been a regular customer of Nykaa but recently, my experience with Nykaa is horrible. For the fast delivery, I did online transaction for 6 products but the delivery man delivered only 3 products.They neither refund me the money that i paid for the remaining 3 products nor they delivered them. My money got stuck. This app is a cheat. Please don't use this app. Highly disapponting and bad experience. Never expected this from nykaa. It doesn't even deserve a single star. Such a scam!"
good experience
"Nykaa is probably the only shopping app that has never disappointed me. It has the authentic products across all trustworthy brands at the best price, and also, good packaging and fast delivery. I got not complaints about my shopping experience at Nykaa."
"I would not say anything about products but about delivery service, worst worst experience. I have never seen as much of unprofessional delivery team in any online selling app. First delivery team said my area is non coverage area although all orders has been received earlier on my address. Delivery person came and asked for money, i gave him 1000 rs, bill was for 644, he said he does not have change. I said keep 500 cash and i can google pay or paytm you. He said no rudely n cancelled order."
good experience .. authentic product.
My experience is good with nayka
Great first experience
Amazing experience...amazing products...great deals and discounts...I am in love with Nykka...I just love shopping with you guys.
Best online experience. Genuine products. Two days delivery and ample of brands with excellent offers. I love Nykaa ü§ó
The delivery of product were very bad it was my first experience at nykaa but daily it say tomorrow but no agent called me I also paid by online
"Ok so first experience was quite good. I felt happy as the order we received was delivered earlier than the mentioned delivery date(advance). But idk on my second order, it became too late, almost 18days delay and the delivery failed. So I cancelled and now I have reorder again recently. I trust Nykaa! Lets see this time. Love love!!"

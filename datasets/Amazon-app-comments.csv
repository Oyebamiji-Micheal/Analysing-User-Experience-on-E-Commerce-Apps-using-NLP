"🔺️😡 Honestly, the Packaging mostly is bad and The things I order come out worn or scratched etc et, THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG, and delivery takes too long too many days than it should, and isn't accurate ... that's DISAPPOINTING ADD TO THAT, delivery is more expensive than other apps 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎 Anyway, my experience with Amazon is seriously very bad made me angry and disgusted 👎"
Interface is as trash as the service itself
"I’m going to be truly honest about my experience. The first time I ordered something, the app showed that my item hadn’t arrived, even though I received it. This happened twice, where it listed an estimated delivery date but then said the item was arriving late. I don’t know if it’s just me, and while it’s not a huge deal as long as my items arrive, it’s a bit confusing and bothersome."
Just can't be doing with the biased algorithms for product suggestions and hate those intrusive videos of some geek flogging tat. Insufficient search filters and the app doesn't offer the same experience as Web based system so your choices are restricted
"Experience had gotten better but lately, they have dropped the ball again. I've learned when I make a larger order for next day. It doesn't show up on time but takes several days. I get large orders can take time, but don't say the item can make it the next day, if it can't make it the next day. Also the return policy has gotten awful. I have to wait a month for a return on a computer that wasn't working properly. Ridiculous."
AMAZON experience gets 0 stars. Customer service is lacking in skill & has become dishonest. Deliveries are going downhill & product sourcing is questionable and low quality. Peace out ✌️ shop local and vendor-direct.
It is an experience with a lot of CyberCrime.
Did someone forget to QA the latest update? When you buy something it still says proceed to checkout and if you press to go back it then says 0 items in cart. I doubt that was the desired user experience 🤔
My experience was not good
"With the recent changes in the UI, the checkout experience sucks , it is often doesn't complete purchases 😵‍💫🤮"
Since 2024 began amazon has continuously pushed updates and made decisions that have severly negatively impacted user experience. Please stop making the app worse.
"The app overall is great from past experience. My issue is with the new visuals. It's very bright and hurts my eyes making using the app unable to be used. Because of this making the app inaccessible to myself, I have to give it a 1 star."
Most recent update made the app slow and unresponsive. Poor shopping experience
"Rufus AI integration is annoying. ""Uninstalled"" app. Will shop on browser only now. With unlock Origin on Firefox the ai Rufus easily blocked. Shopping Experience restored."
"Can't scroll, it freezes and I have to swipe several times before it moves slightly and repeats. Interface looks dated now, where is the dark mode option? It's 2024 not 2004."
😀💖 100% perfect online shopping experience in every way. Amazon is the best thing that ever happened to our USA. Being a Member IS 100% worth it. I'm grateful for every single Amazon team member.
"Buggy, logs you out often, doesn't open. And riddle me this, why do I need to log in to my Amazon account to view information via the email that I just opened the link through? (Especially when I get logged out by the janky app?) seems like the whole experience is linked thru a half assed app. But what do you expect when you hire a bunch of whiny college kids."
"New design is too bright, please add a dark mode. Interface is getting too cluttered."
delivery service is worst. first it shows Saturday and Saturday they call and say it will be late 3/4 more day and will change delivery time. First order experience i am done i would rather use noon.
great experience almost always.
"Screw Amazon. Never ever, ever, will I shop with your company again. First shopping experience was a nightmare and unpleasant, this will be first and the last."
Lovely and easy to use interface. I spend most of my time scrolling in E-com apps. Freaky stuff. Hilarious
"My experience is not good because company Hire people to do there job to deliver PKG To next facility but they don't know what They are doing, don't do there job right. People that work for Amazon are not Qualify, not experience. 👎👎"
I've had a wonderful experience.
excellent experience
"Very bad expirience I'm a costumer of Amazon before it's good bad my last experience is so bad I order foundation and I paid already in my stc pay it is almost one month didn't come the seller said they will refund my money because they lost my item now till now still didn't appear the money in my stc pay , Amazon solve this problem pls ,"
"Hard to use, damaged/ late packages and just a horrible experience. Wth Amazon 😭"
Bad user experience.. they intentionally make you use the filters to get the best experience... else you end getting the budget experience for what you're paying! default weekend deliveries exist no more and you need to make selection for quicker deliveries... else there's no difference between prime and normal ones.. you just wait patiently for your order while they make free money off of you!
"I used to make fun of my ex gf because she was constantly ordering items off Amazon. I hate to admit it, but now I do the exact same thing. YMMV but in my experience the app responds to what you're searching for and will give you some really good discounts on items. It could just be coincidence, but better coupons and offers pop up the longer I take browsing for a particular item. I'm not complaining, I have trouble choosing sometimes and hefty discounts are much appreciated 🙂"
Worst experience with delivery guys so unprofessional lake of responsibility and rude with no ethical they take money they don't give back the rest of it
"Another own goal from Amazon. The app displayed a banner saying, ""Shop faster with voice,"" with a button to turn on the microphone. I'm not interested; but tapping the cross on the banner does not remove it, and the app won't work with the banner displayed. Never mind shopping faster. Now I can not shop at all! The next step will be to remove the app, just like I removed the music app when they destroyed that experience. I think I may soon be cancelling my Prime membership."
"Use to be 5 stars, but lately amazon as a company has really gone down hill with Prime video and their customer service. I have been waiting 5 months for someone from their review customer service department to contact me and all I have been getting is an automated email from them. When I bring this up to general customer service, they are as helpful as they can be... however still cannot get things right on my account. Very poor experience lately. Disappointed."
"Terrible experience with next day delivery. I should have just went out to a local store and bought the items I needed for my trip. Why offer next day delivery, if you can't follow through? They failed to deliver, and I cannot cancel my order which I won't be home to receive. Truly a shame how unreliable the shipping has become."
"Amazon interface and/or policies... Both web and Android app... have become extremely frustrating when there is an issue. I don't see notifications for messages to/from sellers or Amazon. To get to messages you have to search forever and what feels like a dozen layers deep. Even while on the phone with an Amazon customer support rep, the instructions provided didn't match what I saw and it took a lot of trial and error by me to get to the destination. Policies have become too rigid. Unhappy."
the best shopping experience ever! so many items to choose from with good delivery
Very bad experience. I order shoe from France. They send me from China and 1pair but different size and quality looks like so chip.
The new previews while scrolling through product search results makes it difficult to actually scroll down the page. Using the phone with a left hand only makes this a poor experience.
Great shopping experience.
Worst shopping experience ever! CS always use Copy+Paste answers. Keeps rolling and rolling through the same answers. My item was delivered to a whole different country and yet the refund process is taking them more than a month. And it is still going!
So many bad experiences from Amazon to their horrible app to directly ripping the customers off. The app forced switched to a business account and I had to delete it and reinstall it. Many many issues
I never cease to be amazed at the lack of logic in the interface of this app. Doesn't Amazon have the money to hire normal developers and make the interface user-friendly? Explain to me how you can clear the entire cart at once? You can't! Such an elementary and crucial function is simply missing.
"Gotta admit, Amazon used to be a 5 star experience. Now most of my orders are late. Don't listen to their ""deliver by tomorrow"" or ""2 day delivery"", they can't keep that promise. Going to begin phasing Amazon out of my life"
Beat online shopping experience
"App is a bit slow, but overall a good experience"
The scrolling experience is 90% of the what users do on any online retail app and Amazon spoiled it since the recent update of image cards.
"Amazon's service itself is great, but the app makes it almost impossible to make good use of it. Navigating the app feels unresponsive and sluggish. Interacting with UI elements leads to regular freezes. The interface looks outdated and unnecessarily bloated. The overall user experience is frustrating at best."
Great experience 👍
"The place to shop, experience the shopping, especially there sales and fast delivery"
"Worst experience ever.. My order was cancelled without contacting me and without any clear reason, knowing that I was waiting specifically to receive the order Just a waste of time .. Even customer service couldn't help. حرفيا افشل شركه توصيل مندوبين بيشتغلو بمزاجهم وخدمه عملاء فاشله"
Bad customer service in Egypt they stole my money amazon don't buy from Amazon Egypt it is really to bad delivered to me wrong item and don't need to back to me my original items bad experience be aware don't buy from Amazon
Always a great shopping experience no matter where I am!
Always a reliable shopping experience.
I found most of the stuff I need on Amazon and my experience was fantastic
"Very bad experience. They are canceling paid orders without your agreement or validation. Very bad customer service, impolite employees, they do not even understand their own published policy. Untrusted for expensive items such as mobiles."
"I usually have a great experience with the mobile app, but recently (within the last couple of weeks) the app keeps glitching. It freezes and won't let me filter my searches. Today I couldn't even click on prime only items. When I log on to my PC I have no issues with this. Just the app."
"Worst experience ever.. My order was cancelled without contacting me and without any clear reason, knowing that I was waiting specifically to receive the order Just a waste of time .. Even customer service couldn't help."
Best experience ever
It was mostly fine until their no opt-out Rufus AI appeared. Now I'd give it zero stars if I could. Makes the app significantly slower for a completely useless AI assistant. Degraded experience.
I Have Been A Amazon Customer For Almost 5 Years I Have Experienced A Lot And Its Great
Terrible experience. The app must not be telling the people to pack up the orders. Its been 2 weeks and not even shipped yet?
"""Buyer beware,!!"" Impossible to cancel trial of Amazon Prime, DON'T GO THROUGH GOOGLE!!!!! They pinched payment from me despite me cancelling the trial. Dreadful experience"
"It is baffling how Bezos got filthy rich with Amazon, while this app is one of the crappiest I've experienced. I'm honestly surprised that people use it frequently without going nuts."
Prime has lost its value. I finally canceled after being double charged which by itself was not a big deal. But the unbelievably frustrating experience trying to get their robots disguised as support reps to put 2 & 2 together was a level of incompetence like I've never witnessed before. Multiple hours on chat. Multiple intentional disconnects & transfers when the reps decided they were done searching for solutions(to an embarrassingly SIMPLE issue). Unreal. The customer support is horrendous
"Poor experience, amazon state they don't charge until item dispatched, cancelled a order same day, and then wait 7 days for a refund, Amazon has gone downhill recently and there are better alternatives out there"
First time user and got worst experience! Placed an order and tried to trace next day found account is blocked because of misuse. Called customer service ask the reason got replied they will call with in 24 hours.
All this app has going for it is it is well developed and I experience very few bugs. Otherwise its a restricted version of their website. You can't buy certain things in the app and about half of the more involved settings for your profile lead you to the web browser anyway. Its literally easier to just open amazon in the browser.
"Number of bugs and strange UX for basic functions like language selection or delivery address change is incredible. Examples of strange UX: country Poland, selecting english language, application suggesting to change country!. To change address even worse experience"
"Over the past few years, Amazon turned into a sнiт show. Slow deliveries, terrible return policies on junk items, and overall shopping experience deterioration."
Mostly good experiences with most items I have ordered.
Terrible experience.
"The registry system is a mess. When sorting by price low to high, 'Most Wanted' items appear out of order, disrupting the intended sequence. It makes it hard to browse items purely by price. On top of that, the app no longer shows the total number of items in my registry. While they fixed the '23 items, 0 purchased' bug, these new issues make the experience frustrating and confusing."
Amazon delivery team is inexperienced.They don't know the english language.I order something on amazon .I did not receive my parcel yet.Amazon have inexperienced staff that don't know how to manage customers.Amazon took money from me before delivery and parcel does not reach my house and not return my money.Donot order on Amazon
"Bad customer experience. Paying for prime with packages not arriving on time or simply not arriving at all, customer service seems not to put attention to what they're being asked. Lately, I have been over Amazon and am looking for other ways to get my products. If the company continues like this, it will drop sooner rather than later."
I don't do online shopping because of people being able to duplicate from different companies I have never done business with. I want a secured buying experience not FRAUD ACCOUNTS KNOWING MY DEBIT/CREDIT INFO
"The registry system is a mess. When sorting by price low to high, 'Most Wanted' items appear out of order, disrupting the intended sequence. It makes it hard to browse items purely by price. On top of that, the app no longer shows the total number of items in my registry. While they fixed the '23 things, 0 purchased' bug, these new issues make the experience frustrating and confusing."
"I’ve been a loyal Amazon customer for years, but my recent experience with their customer support has left me extremely frustrated. I encountered an issue with a delivery driver, and when I reached out to Amazon for help, I was met with nothing but delays and unhelpful responses. I had to cancel my order."
Always straightforward. The updates they name actually improve user experience and the search results give snapshots of everything relevant that I want to know
Bad experience.
"Experience had gotten better but lately, they have dropped the ball again. I've learned when I make a larger order for next day. It doesn't show up on time but takes several days. I get large orders can take time, but don't say the item can make it the next day, if it can't make it the next day. Use AI or something to correct time for deliveries that are large orders."
"Too many sponsored irrelevant items. About 40-60% of the items are the same exact items that is not what I am looking for. Also, search bar is not funtional due to its auto correction, which you cannot disable. AI completely ruined shopping experience. Besides, item quality is so bad on amazon nowadays while they charge more than double for items or sell in bulk, encouraging unnecessary consumerism."
Experience was horrible can't access my account and the person helping wouldn't even help me call are a trash website call don't want customers obviously
I had a very bad experience with you
"I've been shopping on Amazon for years, and the experience has consistently been top-notch. The wide selection of products, often at competitive prices, makes it my go-to platform for almost anything I need. Whether I'm looking for everyday essentials, electronics, or something more niche, Amazon has it all. The user interface is intuitive and easy"
"The worst experience ever, the stiry is that i harchased the items 3 times , paid online and every time the process was effective and a new delivery date was set,but it was cancelled and I contacted and someone told me ""you will be refunded "" but what about the time waiting the items the time to refund the money. ""those things happen in all companies ""he said . and I ended the call and waited for items , which did not have a problem but didn't arrive as well.recalled them with no result."
"not a bad app, or buying experience, but have since limited my purchases from Amazon after receiving a threatening email from them regarding returns. i now shop more via ebay and walmart online, where item descriptions are much clearer."
"The app was fine before. But latest version with AI, continuously pops up suggested AI questions on every page and product. Why can't I turn this off? Slows down my entire experience. The added lag is ridiculous. Please let me turn off AI suggestions!"
Purchased an item from Amazon that destroyed my phone contacted Amazon and they would do nothing to help me tell me I needed a contact the manufacturer but they have no information on sub manufacturer that is still doing business with them I've never had this such horrible customer service experience with Amazon this is definitely left a bad taste in my mouth now I'm out over $300 on a cell phone because Amazon doesn't want to do anything to help me
Shares my personal information. Takes up phone storage and only provide one feature not found on web interface. Say something to Amazon about getting the purchase code for partner purchases from web interface so the app isn't needed!
Has been getting worse and worse over the years. I don’t think I’ve had a single positive experience with Amazon in the last few years. It’s impossible to find what you’re looking for in the search results. Customer service is just talking to a mellow person who spits out the same pre-recorded answers in a loop (not even sure I’m actually talking to a human). Their items are the same Chinese stuff as other websites but 3x the price. And when you order it always goes wrong somehow…
"In my experience, it is a bad experience. they disappointed me. I had paid cash. Still I didn't get my item."
"I liked scrolling through different items and the colors offered, but the new chat bot has ruined my experience. I'm so tired of clicking on a different color and the chat popping up again, they should add an option that lets me turn the chat pop-up off. I'll ask it for help when I need help. I'd give it less than 1 star if I could."
"The ""My Order History"" section hasn't worked in years, but the rest of the app is fine. Offers a pretty smooth shopping experience."
Horrible experience you have to pay a lot of money if you want to buy items don't install this app
Bad experience... I bought from them an item and unfortunately it was not working and I request for returning they accepted but until now no response to pickup their item and returning my money
"Rufus no!! You are intrusive to my shopping experience can I please shut you off or opt out? Screen real estate is precious and I do not prefer you, nor was I asked."
Shopping experience is pretty nice. The data usage of the app has increased to unacceptable levels though.
On orders tab if you select see all orders and when it takes you to my orders it never seems to load and I am not the only one having this experience.
"For the second time, I tried to order from Amazon, but my account has been put on hold, and I was told by one of your associates that it's due to technical error. You people need to do better how can this happen twice on different mobiles . I really needed those items. I placed the order for,and this being my first time personally ordering from Amazon was a very bad experience ."
TECHNICAL ISSUES WITH THE APP/WEBSITE ORDER HISTORY AND LOGGING IN ALSO 😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬🤔🤔 STILL EXPERIENCED TECHNICAL ISSUES CHECK IT OUT 😬😬😬 HAVEN'T GOT A REFUND YET 😬😬😬🤔🤔 WHY NEED GOOGLE TO SIGN IN AMAZON ACCOUNT DONT MAKE SENSE LIFE WHATEVER AND DONT CARE AT ALL 😬😬😬😬😬 NEEDS ALOT OF IMPROVEMENT AND UPDATING 😬😬😬 SCARED AND NERVOUS AND WORRIED ABOUT THIS REVIEW/MESSAGES/BBB COMPLAINT AS WELL 😬😬😬😬😬
"Let users disable the stupid Rufus feature. I can't imagine that ""constantly frustrated"" is the experience you want people to associate with your app."
And what could I say about the greatest experience
Terrible experience with support. App only lets you contact bots that can't help you with anything. Item delivery delayed twice without showing any reason. Instead of overnight delivery had to wait 4 days and then just cancel it.
"the Amazon experience has really gone to hell. there are three types of returns and they'll label your QR code but won't necessarily tell you, they don't monitor what products they're selling, so you have to return half of the stuff you buy because it's absolute garbage. they're going a long way to making it easier to shop in person than online these days which is absolutely ridiculous."
"I had too bad experience lately in ordering at amazon. It happened twice, they declared my package delivered even i did not received it. Made me worries if i cannot do something to report it, then my package i paid will gone. So sad."
The Rufus AI chatbot is the most irritating thing I have ever experienced in an app. It was something thrust upon me as a user and forces me to be a beta tester when I don't want it! There's no way to turn it off and it is not helpful. It takes up valuable space when you try to weed through search results and product descriptions while also popping up constantly when I don't need it to. I am beyond frustrated. The Amazon Prime service is nothing to brag about either...
Very bad service no benefit for prime member bad experience ❌ don't buy anything can't buy prime membership Amazon didn't deliver on time. For prime member very bad didn't deliver on time
"Very poor experience recently had with this app. App says free delivery, but I was charged for the same when the product is delivered. Also, it doesn't allow to publish these kind of negative feedback on their website."
"Worst delivery experience!! I'll share some of what I have faced prev The delivery man would only drop the package off and leave and wouldn't notify me or call me. Some delivery man would use whatsapp even though I don't have the app. The other experience is the delivery man would never answer my calls. Amazon would put an estimated time of arriving at 9 pm without being specific and without arranging delivery time with the delivery man, so it means you have to stay all day long waiting."
"Ever since Amazon added Rufus (AI) whenever you select a product or get search results, you have to wait for Rufus to prompt questions. Slows down the quick browsing experience. There is no turning Rufus off. So your stuck."
Bad experience. If you're going to buy clothing I recommend a chines3 app. No problem with those apps.
International app which doesn't allow you to pick interface language. How am I supposed to use the app when I'm travelling and trying to buy something in the local amazon? On the website version you can at least use built-in translator...
Great shopping experience
"Poor experience with prime day sales. Bought 2 items from amazon UK (coming to Aus) one was shipped after a week. The other had a shipping est time of 14 aug to 29 sept. Decided to cancel it 2 days ago (27/7) Got 2 emails today, first saying cancellation rejected, the other said item is now shipped (est delivery now 14/8). So i have to cancel items to get a better dispatch time now? I noticed the same item is now up on amazon Aus and has overnight delivery, with only a $4 price diff. What a joke"
My experience with Amazon is not good because it takes them to long update The tracking. Especially if be deliver Next day.
"Wonderful experience, easy to use, user friendly, abundant variety of products to choose from. The delivery system works and is reliable. Overall excellent application and shopping experience"
"Very bad shopping experience. Orders get cancelled without informing you. Any new order will automatically use your credit card as long as it is saved in the application without asking you if this is your prefered payment method for this order. Changing the database is some kind of mystery, you have to search alot until you find how to change your personal details. The application isn't user friendly at all. Uninstall now."
This app is bizarrely overrated. Shopping on Amazon is a terrible interface what are people thinking?
"App was great, I could almost always find what I wanted. Now with the Rufus addon, my experiences are becoming tiresome. The Rufus popup, almost always covers something I want to see, and half the time, while I scroll the page, will go full screen. Stop the Rufus Popup. Itbis becoming cumbersome."
"Amazon, you are really making peoples life difficult even when you want to take thier money. I submit several times all documents you requested from to unblock my account but I guess you don't care. Thank you for the outstanding experience!!!"
"Tons of accounts are banned over reviews of products. Following the terms of service 100% means nothing. If you buy a lot of products and review them all, they might think you are getting products in trade for reviewing them to manipulate the market. Or something far-fetched like that. The next stage after being banned from reviews is a potential ban from your Amazon account. Worst experience ever. I tried to help tons of people with detailed reviews."
This app has very shady tactics that make it hard to submit a return and replacements. They also have very bad practices that prevent you from writing an honest review of your experiences. I'm done with them.
"Very bad experience, I cancelled subscription of Amazon but still deducting 16 SAR every month and no way to stop this."
Great shopping experience
User friendly with multiple options to expand your shopping experience.
"My experience with Amazon has been 97%, the best online shopping for items needed"
simply the best online shopping experience possible....
My experience with Amazon has been working out.
"delivery is horrible, most drivers don't follow directions properly. Amazon loses package about every 3rd order. They don't care about the customer or experience you have with them."
Horrible customer service and experience. Put account on hold with no notice and no reason given. No point of contact too. Throwing error pages randomly. Trash
"Phenomenal site, experience and prices!"
TECHNICAL ISSUES WITH THE APP/WEBSITE (ORDER HISTORY) 😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬🤔🤔 STILL EXPERIENCED TECHNICAL ISSUES CHECK IT OUT 😬😬😬 HAVEN'T GOT A REFUND YET 😬😬😬🤔🤔
The overall experience w/ Amazon's services is that I can shop for every holiday and find just about anything. Amazon is a concierge service that's annoying to retailers. It's a businesses revolution. I just notice prime video isn't giving free video watch with trials. That's out of control in my opinion that's why I didn't give 5 stars. Whole foods is a extra plus if you need to grocery shop. I appreciate Amazon prime and don't really mind not being subscribed because I spend alot anyway.
Delivered defected item. Return was raised the same day. Agents level and level 2 have been giving misinformation since day 1. Every other agent says the last one gave the wrong information. No resolution for more than one month when nobody is picking up the return. Horrible experience. They want the customer to keep calling them and waiting for the pickup.
User interface is lacking. Was left in limbo when trying to contact customer service.
Excellent experience!! I can always find exactly what I need!
I have bad experience with subscription payment through application and misscontact between customer service and the courrier system..
Everytime i tried to use an acct and log in the app has always an issue. I cannot proceed even i was able to sign up and completed the steps and put in cittect info. The system says internal issue pkease try again. Worst experience if i can give you zero i will.
always a great experience shopping and if necessary making returns. top rate customer service
"Be mindful when you order from Amazon and it's a 3rd party seller, it can be a bad experience. They use FedEx, ups etc and they suck. SEVERAL times I've gotten my package weeks late. When you buy, they mark it as ""package picked up"" by carrier and you can't cancel the order. Delivery dates from before/after purchase don't match. Since it's marked as picked up, you can't cancel delivery. You have to buy again from someone else for an Amazon delivery and then return the late delivery."
Wrong items sent and Amazon is not ready to replace. AMZON luring innocent coustmers by give false hope for discounts by sending wrong items. Worst aster sale service. We subscribe prime only to avail promotion but horrible experience. They are not ready to replace the items. Putting call on hold for long time.. Worst customer care.
"Amazon used to be an amazing online shopping platform. Modern Amazon gets you slow shippings and no competitive pricing options. Amazon prime doesn't even give you any benefits, you are just paying them extra for the bad experience."
I didn't recive the order or a message that it was canceled and will be refuneded bad experience
Worst ever experience my product is not yet received
A shopping experience.
"Amazon South Africa is a joke. The books I read are not available on the app. There's no category for music and DVD. The interface is a joke. Fix it. I want to order my books, music, and movies without having to pay exorbitant amounts in shipping costs. Why are you here if I still have to buy international?"
Awful experience
They locked my account without an option to contact their support. I demanded they cancel my pending transaction but the do not respond. Terrible experience.
Love it!!. Best shopping experience. Great app. Good job App Developers 👏 👏 👏
"Shocking user experience. Tons of sponsored items, repeated items, filters that don't work, hard to navigate and visually too cluttered."
Rufus needs to be an option. It's taking up a third of my screen. It interrupts my shopping experience. Now rufus takes up even more space after July 2024.
"No one asked for this stupid AI. It's disruptive and makes the experience of your app awful! I rarely go on it anymore. Congrats, you've driven me away."
"The worst, irresponsible company to deal with and the worst purchasing experience ever"
"The addition of an AI option is absolutely ruining my experience. The security concerns of anything involving AI is a concern on it's own, but this implementation is also just awful. You can't turn it off, it has chat suggestions at the bottom of the content that means less ability to actually see the product, and it is super sensitive to clicks anywhere near it, meaning at any moment I may have an AI chat pop up if I am trying to interact with anything on the bottom third of the screen. Stop"
Very bad experience
Always an effortless experience!
"This app is very slow to load and laggy. Probably because it's so bogged down on ads, animations, AI popups, and it's laughably pathetic video feed that answers the question ""what if TikTok didn't have any content, other than the ads. What a thoughtless shopping experience, designed by fools. Whatever low-IQ executive thought Ads should block users from buying product from your store fundamentally misunderstands the entire purpose of advertising, and therefore is not qualified for their job."
"I have no bad experience, I got my l e d lights as soon as I ordered them. I love Amazon it's the 5 star rating that I would like, they get stuff for there for you as soon as possible the l e d lights were not damaged. They were perfect, they were perfectly fine, that's why I'm giving you a 5 star reading. Amazon is probably the best delivery app I've got all of my orders as soon as soon I got to order it. the same day, I order them, Amazon is probably the best thing!"
always a great experience!
Bad experience i was ordered study table and I paid online payment already but they didn't delivered my order the deliver date was 12/07/24 and now date 16/07/24.
excellent shopping experience. Great App
The app resets itself and sends you back to the home page after not being opened in the foreground for more than a few moments. Switching between Amazon and any other app will make me lose my place which is incredibly frustrating. The app and website are both incredibly overbloated with basic features like wish lists being hidden because Amazon would rather strongarm users into buying something or anything as opposed to actually helping them have a good experience.
Didn't work. Tried to use the app to pickup an order from a locker. Gave the app permissions and still it couldn't connect to the locker. Poor user experience. Clicked on Contact Customer Sevices only to be faced with a load of irrelevant options and no way to report the issue. What was wrong with the simple pickup codes? Lost sale and disappointed customer.
Worst experience I've ever had shopping online they decide to cancel both my orders after give confirmation of my order and I didn't know thinking I got my orders in I went ahead and spent my money on other stuff now I don't have the money for my orders speaking to a real person is impossible even after ask for a call back says call back is unavailable just horrible business all the way around
The addition of the Rufus AI that constantly pops up has made for an incredibly unfriendly shopping experience. There's needs to be a way to opt out of the experience. There's a reason people are selected as beta testers.
"Awful experience. Worst packaging, awful delivery process, and extremely annoying. You would be lucky if you find a good customer support agent to talk to if you face issues which you most probably will."
"the absolute WORST customer service I have EVER experienced. No respect for their customers and don't honour the original agreement for delivery after purchase has been made. Extremely disrespectful to customers, no care for the inconvenience they cause either. Also, their Canadian representatives don't understand English well enough to ACTUALLY help. A disgrace."
"Get rid of Rufus. Give us the option that If we want it, we can enable it. Let the consumer choose his shopping experience. The annoying bar that keeps sliding up everytime you are browsing is endlessy useless and annoying."
I have always had a great experience with Amazon
Very good experience
Awesome experience
no experience. to learn more.thanks
always a pleasant experience
great experience
"So they added some dumb chatbot that constantly pops up when you're browsing. Why on earth would I want a chatbot when I'm shopping? And there's nothing in the app to add feedback about features. Add an opt out, a way to turn it off, or get rid of it, it makes zero sense and it makes the experience worse."
"They sell the things they don't even have. CS keep telling you to wait. What a waste of my time. I ordered a mattress, bed frame and bed sheets from Amazon AU. I had the worst experience. They charged but only delivered the bed frame and bed sheet without the mattress. I asked CS many times. They told me to wait for their email when they have stock. But they never told me how long to wait and when will they ship the product. Customer barely have their protection and say in front of AMAZON."
What is going on with adding this stupid AI question bot interface? Absolutely destroyed the shopping experience. Everything lags and operates slowly now. Seems like your UI/UX team is made up of toddlers!
"With this app, I am always able to find exactly what I need. I especially appreciate the ability to read reviews by others because their experiences help educate me about a purchase I am considering. Customer service has been able to address every concern that I have had with professional and friendly support. I especially appreciate the ability to chat with customer service to receive in the moment help. It performs excellently without any hiccups or being glitchy, as my students like to say."
New app changes suck. They did not improve user experience and have made the app less useful
Typically shopping on Amazon is really nice but those times it is not why does it seem like every time I post an honest negative review it falls short to meet the standard of the community guidelines and is not posted but every good review makes it without an issue. If an experience is negative other people deserve to know so they are better informed on making purchases here. What good are reviews if they are biased and censored against the consumers?
"Ugh... the AI is extremely unhelpful. When trying to search the reviews in app, it keeps giving me the same irrelevant canned answer instead of maybe, I dunno, *showing the reviews that contain the keyword* that I am searching?!? When scrolling through reviews, I see the word but the awful AI interface won't show any results. Having a specific problem assembling an item but can't efficiently get to the clever workarounds often present in reviews that were written by humans who built it."
Good experience
Have an awesome experience with Amazon shopping in UAE.

"Get rid of Rufus. Give us the option that If we want it, we can enable it. Let the consumer choose his shopping experience."
Great experience
Bad experience
Very bad experience don't bey agen
Fast delivery and never experienced any issues with the purchased products.
Always a great experience
"Poor service, intentionally poor interface, reviews mean nothing. Do not use this service."
Good experience
"I had the worst experience so far, I ordered an item, it was supposed to be delivered on a date, but it got delayed and there is no update mentioned in the amazon as well, when I reached to the support they said it will be delivered but since it was delayed than promised date they said they will initiate refund(said to calle back after item received) and asked me to keep the item, now when I call their agent is telling otherwise, which is bullsh*t, I don't care about 30 dollars, but the word!"
"My experience in actually receiving my packages from Amazon has gone downhill. They are either super delayed, canceled on me, or never show up. The AI feature in the chat is beyond annoying and takes forever to convince it to connect to an actual person. The chat lags and the respond bar glitches to where I can't type anything unless I back out of the chat and reenter. This happens every single time I need to respond."
"From 5 stars back in 2020 to 2 stars in 2024. No customer service to resolve an issue, only bots and click answer, issue. Also, how many people have lost them jobs? They are replaced by a bot? A total mess. It is difficult to get a refund, almost impossible to contact the seller, and it is very complicated to use the app. I will stop using amazon. I'm very frustrated after my last 2 experiences with amazon."
"Bugs programmeren om te stelen. Schande en hoe HANDIG VOOR AMAZON NA +20.JAAR OM ZO TE STELEN, TE ONTWIJKEN, LIEGEN, BELEDIGEN EN DE DOMME HAAS UIIT TE HANGEN. UPDATEN OMDAT ER NOOIT EEN AFGEWERKT PRODUCT AANGEKOCHT IS? DE APP? DE APP IS GEEN AFGRWERKT PRODUCT VOOR EEN TEVREDEN KLANT MAAR BOEVEN, DIEVEN. SCHANDALIG. EN OPNIEUW VANDAAG. UPDATE UPDATE OM HANDIGE FRAUDE INTERFACE : NIET VOOR KLANTEN. WAAROM IS PRIME ER OM 100% TE STELEN BIJ NIET PRIME KLANTEN? EN DAN; PRIME KLANT OF NIET!FRAUDEAPP"
"My experience has been great, with the deals,the return policies ,the delivery drivers,and customer service. All the waves of the future to provide for the human race. The "" company "" Amazon , are people, policies, ethical,business, ""we"" should not take lightly. We in the States and around the world may find such humanities, As our domain for survival, while governments are having their problems Even with the company's imperfections, it's required for future."

Shop confidently with 360° product views, customer reviews, and 24/7 support. Experience easy browsing, personalized recommendations, and daily deals across various categories.

"Acc connections, links, security and login, basic profile information changes are near impossible. I've changed my name on the account months ago and it still comes in the wrong name. The email won't change after 10s of tries. Linking to another thing is always just a toss up. Expect the unexpected. If something should work, cuz why would it not, it probably won't. Obviously the shipping and shopping is a decent experience but that's why they get atleast the 1 star 👏👏"
"Very disappointed that amazon is following the trend of invasive virtual assistant that you can't turn off or hide in an effective way. I'm sure your devs are proud of the work they did on it, but explain to me how not having the option to remove it from the Amazon experience is beneficial to the customer."
Good shopping experience and everything I ordered comes on time.
"You're getting 1 star because of Rufus. This has appeared in my app, and it is annoying. The interface pops up and gets in my way. HOW DO I DISABLE IT??? Give me the option to turn it on or off. I am so annoyed by almost every program I use, shoving a new, annoying AI in my face. Ask my permission before turning it on! Once I can disable it, I’ll change my review."
In my personal experience. Everything that Amazon prime has to offer. There's is no value. I honestly have nothing good to say. All the services are bad and misleading. Worst part about shopping through them is they give you search results that you are not searching for! Too many ads are distracting and makes it very confusing while searching. Resulting in me shopping elsewhere.
"I don't want the ai rufus thing at all. It bogs down a shopping experience I already had a fine time navigating on my own, and all I want is to be able to turn it off."
Very fast and reliable services best online shopping experience in Egypt
bad experience
All my experiences have been grate always thankful for the things that i bought. The only issue was wit deliveries from UK Amazon. DPD has not been grate from this year. There were two orders that i needed to refund due to my parcels being lost. Other than that it's all good 5 Stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 🦁
"I've been an Amazon customer for years, and I have to say, I'm consistently impressed by the level of service and selection they provide. Ordering from Amazon is always such a seamless experience - the website is so user-friendly and intuitive, and the checkout process is a breeze. And the variety of products available is truly staggering, I can always find exactly what I need. But what I really love is how quickly my orders will arrive within two days."
Always good experience except in the delivery of the offersin this game and attempts to get samples
"Ever since Rufus showed up, Amazon has become an irritating shopping experience. I love all the variety of products,fast delivery, and some of the prices but Rufus has made it ridiculously annoying to shop when every time I search something it immediately pops up. I can shop for myself and find deals myself. I always have. Please give an option to turn this irritating bot off."
Obnoxious AI assistant added recently. No way to shut the thing off. Uninstalling and going back to web interface.
Amazon has took a turn for the worst. I've lost so much time and respect for this company because of a poor customer service experience with their system and app.
"Soooooooo bad experience, and the worst customer service ever. شركة غير مسؤله وموظفين غير مسؤولين اسوء خدمة عملاء علي الإطلاق"
Very easy shopping experience.
"No dark mode | Even more clutter in the bottom bar, makes me dislike using the app | Still doesn't have dark mode. | I'm clicking the wrong button all the time. Please fix it. | The new update ruins the experience by putting an Inspiration tab right where you would click to go to see your orders. I constantly click it by accident. | Previous version review for a long time: Great redesign, allows for multi tab browsing. And it doesn't freeze like the old version"
No experience because i can't use it on pakistan this is very sad
"Get rid of the Rufus AI. It constantly pops up and obfuscates my shopping experience, and with no option to disable it? Fix it and I'll give you back 5 stars. Lord knows I spend enough with your company!"
This app SUCKS now that the AI is added. I click an item and the size goes all out of whack and the AI pops up. Give me back my old experience. I can't even use the AI. It times out EVERYTIME. YES MY APP IS UP TO DATE. GIVE ME BACK MY OLD EXPERIENCE
"My package ($1300 in value) was delivered to the wrong house. Even the picture showed the wrong house. They wanted me to make a police report before refunding me or sending me another one. But the police told me that because it was delivered to the wrong house, that's not a criminal problem. It's an Amazon problem. So because I wouldn't lie or falsify a police report. I lost out and didn't get my item nor a refund. It was the worst experience I've ever had with Amazon. The worst. (-5 stars)"
worst experience ever
"Jun2024: NO dark mode. Oct2023: 🔴 NO IMAGE SEARCH IN APP 🔴 Really BAD helping experience, about my unreceiving stuff, with stupid messaging options 👎"
"This review is in regards to the website. Shopping experience is terrible on website! I tried to click ""proceed to checkout"" and it is loading almost 5 mins and won't let me move to the step to make payment. Awful website bugs."
Amazon is my go to. It's easy to return items if needed. I also feel in my experience the items I've ordered are of great quality.
No experience
Best online shopping service. Minor a few delivery issues that do need addressing. My experiences and options as a company have been fantastic.
"Horrific, The last couple Amazon experience I've had have been so poor with customer service. That was so poor. I'm appalled, I have it on camera too, One driver stole my package, The other driver tried to break into my home and I called him face-to-face cuz I have him on camera doing it, Amazon refused to compensate me for my lost time and efforts trying to resolve the matter, this is a joke, I've had a breaking and entering, And a theft in the past four Amazon visits. This is ridiculous."
"I ❤️ Amazon! It has changed the way I shop, making my shopping experience more efficient.. Amazon has found a way to personalize online shopping, and for that, I am grateful!"
Every experience has been wonderful
Great Shopping Experience
Bad experience Expensive items Not as described
If you don't like spending money that much this isn't the bad for you every time you look up something you get a million things and it's impossible not to buy anything but pretty good experience
Absolutely worst shopping experience ever the worst app screw your two-step verification I will buy garbage from somebody else that's all you sell is Chinese garbage
"Amazon India: one of the worst customer service experience ever. Recently I had to order the same phone twice, yet Amazon can't help debit the right payment mor deliver my phone on tome. It's simply horrible horrible horrible."
"I love amazon. The app is extremely intuitive and works well. Very happy with the ecosystem, very happy with the user friendly features and ability to shop quickly and easily. App functions as expected without problems. 10/10 experience, 5 stars."
I always have a great shopping experience with Amazon.
worst experience ever
Great experience
"Stop saying it's out for delivery if it's not actually out for delivery. Clean up the mess of a user interface. Get rid of the hordes of knock-off garbage. Make the search function actually work, or stop calling it a search function"
Amazon Shopping 🛍 has made my LIFE so much BETTER. The overall experience of using this app is easier than alot of the other Shopping apps available.
good.. but bad experience with delivery person..
"I've had a buggy experience while travelling and trying to buy things for my family back home. the app keeps trying to redirect me, even when it has verified that it iS me with MFA"
"There is no response if the account is on hold, but no idea it's why it's kept on hold for long days. Worst experience I have ever faced in the past years. Switching to other platforms. Thanks Amazon"
"Amazon Amazing shopping experience, accuracy responsible and customer satisfaction garranteed"
"Always loved it. Its better than all the other apps/ shopping sites that i have and use , but it just has that little bit extra. I definitely have years of experience shopping with them plus they have a customer support team who have in the past helped me out, which was great. The products are delivered without delays and I find lots of good bargains aswell."
"First experience with their customer support. I am disappointed. I cancelled an item, the item was removed from my order. This was on their platform. It was shipped anyway and they are telling me the cancel never processed. In fact according to their customer service, I never requested to cancel the item. This makes me second guess using amazon. Yes I can return the item. The question for me was this a software issue or was it human error and they are covering for it. Either way it looks bad."
"I ordered two products three times through Amazon Prime, and none were delivered. I've been waiting from May 22 to June 13, 2024. Support promised delivery today, but it didn't happen. The system shows delivered, but I received no call or products. Orders without Amazon Prime work better; the wait is 5-6 days, but at least they arrive. Very disappointing experience with Amazon Prime."
Overall great experience but I wish the monthly fee was a little lower for prime
Worst app ever I use for shopping 4 days my order is delay and no one infrom or guide y its happen and what is the reason customers service are not helping just keep saying its came today but in the end of the day nothing u got.first and last time to use this app for shopping and never even recommend to anyone to use for shopping. After 4 days when I didn't recive my order then I cancel then said its take 5 to 7 workking days just for refund.worst shopping experience ever.
"Overall an okay user experience but the notifications have become spotty. An item of mine was returned because I was not notified of its delivery to a pickup location, and I only happened to prevent that a second time by going into the app to track another item. All my settings have notifications turned on. This app has a decent interface and functionality but this is a real convenience issue."
"They are stingy with points compared to Rakuten. Too many promotional goods show up in results instead of what you are looking for. Prime membership keeps getting degraded and I am locked out of many benefits because I made my account in another country and moved abroad with it. Shipping is delayed, orders between Friday and Tuesday don't get delivered until Wednesday so same day shipping isn't a thing coupled with occasional order delays. The experience is becoming worse with time."
"I was forced to install this app to receive the package I had ordered and paid for, and it required me to let it connect to my location. Horrific experience and a violation of privacy. This has solidified my determination to completely delete my account"
Amazon is alright but had my experience of not being refunded 1 year ago
"Horrible experience! Cannot save changes in my account! Cannot delete or add products to my cart. Try different days already, and it doesn't work! Shamed that such a big company can not fix all these issues that clients have to deal with for some time already!"
Truly Amazon app is amazing.. it's great shopping experience for me.. well done Amazon.. keep the up the good work.
always have a great experience ordering from Amazon.
"Great first experience.... Pricing and shipping at metion in policy and terms.. Thanks to Amazon my old gaming subwoofer works with, changed amplifier from Amazon and wire. Shop shipped, satisfied first time order. 2010 beat your subwoofer on.."
"Can't change country from USA to France, what a horrible interface"
Great experience
Good experience
Always the best shopping experience
The online shopping experience is convenient and secure always a valuable experience
nice experience with the app
"For the most part I love amazon. My complaint is Amazon sets the expected delivery time and I ordere accordingly. If you can't deliver not only the time frame that you set but not even the day I feel that is a dishonest and manipulative way to do buissness and it wasted my time and now money. Amazon is not nearly as reliable as they used to be If you are in a hurry , you cannot fully depend on Amazon in my experience with multiple packages being days off from when expected."
"Terrible shopping experience!!! Theres no filters, everything is chucked on 1 page. Im looking for a Samsung phone and theres cables, wires, headsets, tablets, cases you name it all on 1 page have to scroll through a million things i got no interest in just to get to 1 phone, then scroll through millions of cables and wires again to find a 2nd phone. Horrible navigation system. Categories shows ""all electronics"", computer section shows ""all computers"" and thats how the entire shop goes!"
"They're not what they used to be. THEY BLACKLIST YOU. If you make digital returns by chat they'll turn around and block you with the message ""We hit a snag with chat."" Yet they allow the returns. Kind of Orwellian. Wouldn't you rather have a more formal and fair experience when transacting business? Audible and general Amazon ""shadowban"" paying customers. Sick! I'm using Walmart + now."
"Ai has made this app massively slower and worse experience. Started receiving ads in my notifications, not cool. Amazon search often ignores the terms you search for, no way to force it with "" "" Search results now show FROM price with coupons that don't apply to the product you're looking at and the price for a different item altogether."
I have not had an bad experience with Amazon yet.
"Frustrating user interface, unclear and makes hard to find important settings (Without mentioning bad experience with notifications, e.g. Arrival date changes not reported or others messages that you could expect just aren't sent)"
Rufus needs to be an option. It's taking up a third of my screen. It interrupts my shopping experience.
Very good experience
My experience with Amazon is not good because every time they pick USPS to Deliver my PKG things go wrong with Amazon Because they take long time to deliver my PKG to my local post office so mail lady Can deliver my PKG. Amazon knows post office don't deliver pkgs At night. People at Amazon facility don't do There job right. 👎 When pkgs in Amazon hands it there responsibility to let customers know Where pkgs are when there pkgs be Deliver to USPS post office.
"DOES NOT HAVE A DARK MODE! This app does not obey Android's dark mode, and even resists the ""Force Dark Mode"" from Android developer options. Using the phone's browser gives a better shopping experience."
One of the worst customer services experiences I have ever had to go throught. They sent to wrong address more then 5 days ago and I still have got any confirmation of refund or replacement. They have just taken my money and left me.
No bad experiences with it so far.
"App is great, I've experienced great customer service."
"App is freaking out a lot since the last update. Crashing, freezing, stuttering when scrolling, and now not showing my orders and not letting me rate the delivery experiences."
"excellent, lovely experience"
"not the best shopping experience I've had compared to others, had items canceled on me or had to cancel items that just never got restocked after more than a month of waiting. Not the best looking site or layout imo and some images and or descriptions have been misleading."
"Terrible experience so much worse than eBay Paid for shoes wrong the Amazon app from Sports Direct. At no time was it clear its not Amazon. Anyway EVRI failed to deliver (didn't make it outside the depot and EVRI don't care) and was immediately returned to sender. So SD chosen courier chooses not to deliver, but SD won't give a refund until goods received. In eBay I'd have had my money back 2 days ago. It's just really really rubbish. Both Amazon and Sports Direct"
"I used to think that Amazon was great, but honestly in Mexico shipping is lame, things are never on time, they always have problems finding the address and some don't even call or try to find the address. Dissatisfaction and disappointment is all I can resume my experience with."
"Easy to navigate and find what your looking for. User friendly interface for setting up your payment type. I love how you can load your cart up and it saves it forever as long as the product is still available. Great place to find ""gems"" you didn't know existed. Like my Zelda blankets or table lamp that projects an image to the ceiling."
"My experience is the worst , i talk here about amazon egypt I request a product and delivery man come for three days making 3 attempts without deliver my product or reaching me although i being at home after this order cancelled from amazon"
"Nothing with the app, just got a bad experience I ordered a pair Of blue heels n the driver delivered an empty box. YES IT WAS HIM WHO TOOK them. I was watching him n when I got to my door he was gone. Never had any confirmation of the order had arrived. Hope he looks handsome with his blue heels"
"Overall, I'm very pleased with the Amazon experience."
your return experience is a joke. you have all these options for me to return it yet it still takes over 30 days for me to get any money back. that is unacceptable. guess I'll just be ordering through Walmart. and don't you dare reply back and say you issue the refund before 30 days and then it takes your bank time to process. that's still unacceptable when your owner just deconstructed a bridge to move his yacht through the town. we all need to wake up and realize that this is not acceptable.
Great shopping experience
I have been using Amazon for quite a few years and I have always had a positive experience with great service and value.
"FFS it gets worse 😡🤬😡🤬, it seems Amazon do NOT act on feedback, because the Bloated lists continue to get worse and more bloated, all we need is our lists, we don't need lists of our lists, (trending, fast delivery, etc). The whole Amazon (shopping/prime/fire TV ), is becoming such a chore, compared to the smooth experience it used to be 🤬😡🤬😡🤬"
"This is a Phenomenal app, returns are easy if needed, Tons of items to browse. Great deals, and friendly customer service. Although I tend to stick away from some 3rd party sellers on here as I haven't had the best experiences with some."
best shopping experience ever
Abysmal experience. Advertising shipping arrivals of 2-4 days and most are now taking 10....Ten days. Not sure what changed at the company but it's reliability is pretty much gone.
"2 weeks for delivery. Sold me a FAKE samsung that's ain't even a samsung. No RETURNSit says, no Refund. I was missold Sooo upset Think TRUST Amazon, Think again. This experience, Amazon has lost a customer"
I'm not a fan of the interface 🤷🏻‍♂️
"I had an awesome experience for their customer services... they easily had plans for my weariness about my wrong shipping address, and i get refunded easily. Their beauty products that i used to order have the same quality that i mostly bought in the store. So far, amazon shopping is very convenient for your daily necessity."
A very very bad shopping experience.. After a long time of dealing with Amazon and lots of purchases they refuses to refund money for one purchase according to them they had an accident in return process and I am requred to send them an email including a report which I refused cuz it's not my job to do so. Time to say bye bye amazon.
"I would give it a 5 if I had experienced the app more, but for some reason, I can't make my account into the app."
"Edited my 5 star review to reflect recent changes in experience. If you live anywhere in the 48 continental states, it's's great to receive your items in a timely manner, but the longistics need to be fixed in order to also acomodate costumers living outside the 48 states."
C'est aberrant d'être la référence du commerce en ligne et d'avoir un interface de récupération de colis aussi mal fait! Le lien pour le site du transporteur est caché c'est grotesque !
"I have no experience of shopping on amazone, and now I installed this app in my android so I could tell about it after using this aap."
Not good services sorry to say this? not satisfied Customer no one reply no warranty card available no invoice copy how well cx buy next time very bad experience.
"I was new to Amazon back in 2021 and up till today. My family and I had the most amazing experience. The packages get taken cared of, they're in perfect condition once they've been delivered. Everything!"
"The look and feel of the app feels dated if you compare it to some other apps we have like Takealot,Amazon is a giant but should look at redesigning it's interface.This feels very 2012 .The graphics a grainy as well.So meh in comparison to takealot."
"Gave me money on a item that came a day late, meanwhile walmart delivered an item two weeks late and nothing... Amazon has definitely been the better experience for me"
What a terrible experience at whole foods. Where's the QR code? My wife has an iPhone and the button to press is right under the search bar on the main screen. Why is it so difficult with Android app?

It helps me with my homework n experiences on my new language
Some of the subscription interfaces are hard to use/find. I am learning.
"My experience with Amazon Shopping is TERRIBLE!!! They take money, send you the WRONG items, in my case TWICE, which I sent back the next day for one item, then the following day for the other. They have both items and NOW it takes damn near 3 weeks for one REFUND and possibly 4 weeks for the other item REFUND!!! Then you're transferred to non-English people in a Call Center in another country!!! DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON SHOPPING, you will NOT be happy how you get the run-a-round!!!"
The worst customer experience I have ever recieved. My very first items order was returned undelivered. Stay away from Amazon.
"Usually a great experience through amazon. I have returned items because they arrived damaged and when I ordered a new one they were packed just as poorly and still arrived damaged. Sometimes a shipping label is placed directly on an item instead of packing it, even after paying for shipping. Also, I suggest never adding items to your order in order to get the same day delivery, EVERY time I have done this my order has arrived late anyway, same day delivery is a lie. Still overall good experienc"
shopping is made simple and returns are simpler. and the customer experience and service is outstanding in my opinion.
"Amazon is... Amazon. An absolute 'jungle' mess of random products with hopelessly inconsistent pricing, delivery timeframes and information. The soulless purchasing experience - devoid of any personal human contact - epitomises the classic modern approach to commercialism. Disappointing and frustrating to use. BUT, their customer service is ocassionally great (it depends who you get answering your query) so sometimes you'll not have regrets when buying."
Rufus is a terrible addition to the app. It interrupts the shopping experience. I find myself swiping down multiple times per product page to close the bottom menu that takes up screen real estate with unhelpful suggestions. It also causes the app to be less responsive. Please provide an option to disable it!
"sometimes shipping isn't as quick as advertised. I've had good experiences with returning items, apart from starting the return, they hide the 'contact us' very well, but once you open a dialogue it's pretty good for returns."
"sometimes shipping isn't as quick as advertised. I've had good experiences with returning items, apart from starting the return, they hide the 'contact us' very well, but once you open a dialogue it's pretty good for returns."
My experience with Amazon is the best their is no problem that they can not fix Amazon any issues that u have they willing to solve the problem with u what ever you are looking for Amazon is the best 😊
A very extraordinary experience!
"The most awful experience, Bazos BLOWS! WATCH YOUR BANK ACCOUNT AFTER EVERY TRANSACTION HERE!"
"I have used this app for years, and I have never experienced the number of glitches that I have had in the last few months. I can only scroll through a few items, slowly, before it just freezes up and stops loading. At first, I assumed it was my service, but I had no other issues with any other apps or streaming. I realized that if I closed the amazon app and waited a few minutes, I could use it again. This has become an ongoing cycle of opening and closing the app, repeatedly, to use it."
"Even more clutter in the bottom bar, makes me dislike using the app | Still doesn't have dark mode. | I'm clicking the wrong button all the time. Please fix it. | The new update ruins the experience by putting an Inspiration tab right where you would click to go to see your orders. I constantly click it by accident. | Previous version review for a long time: Great redesign, allows for multi tab browsing. And it doesn't freeze like the old version"
"The breakdown of the orders makes no sense. I get that items are coming from different places when ordering, but could everything be on the same ""receipt"" not broken down to show me individual prices and taxes, so when I look for how much I spent in total on one transaction it shows up like that? I don't want to use a calculator to add up all the totals. One order with 5 items becomes 3 or more separate orders. The order filter category is a terrible experience and not helpful at all."
"Initially, I lived with the multiple problems and difficulties experienced with this app because it was convenient. As the quality of Amazon's services decreased, my frustrations with the app increased. Features and functions change so frequently that I find it impossible to shop. I don't have these issues with apps from alternative online retailers - Amazon get it together!!"
"Latest update: The new ""Rufus"" content completely bogs down an item page. It becomes so bad I have to conpletely stop the app and reload. Older updates: Extremely slow to load content (and getting worse with each update) unless you're on wifi. The latest UI updates are just awful. The change to the lists (and lists of lists, to boot) is horrible. Interface gets worse and worse."
"Most folks are pretty familiar with the concept of Amazon shopping in some extent or another. However, recently been getting annoyed about a rather obnoxious UI decision: There are in-app vibrations that you have absolutely no way of turning off without disabling system-wide vibrations. As a Prime user, I expect a clean and clear shopping experience, but the constant obnoxious buzzing is making the app unusable for myself and might drive me to canceling my membership at this rate"
Ever since last update Amazon shopping and audible are both garbage. Audible stops randomly went on Bluetooth or the screen shuts off. Amazon shopping keeps closing saying that there's a bug in the program and forces the app shut down. Amazon please fix your buggy app so people can spend money on it. You would think you would want people to have an easy-to-use shopping experience not this junk app that keeps crashing right and left.
None of the sponsored items load when you click on them. If you're a seller I highly recommend you do not sponsor your item. Locker pick ups don't work. The app doesn't load the next step. Absolutely absurd that a company this big placed lockers in several locations just for the app to not work when picking up. They keep changing the interface on returns. Its different for every item. I'm glad I canceled my Prime membership. Now that they have idiots running this company I better back off.
"All day today it's been crashing. I cleared the cache on my Android, still crashes, uninstalled and reinstalled the app, still crashes, rebooted my phone, still crashing. The error report states that there is a ""bug"" in the app. Never in my many years using this app have I experienced issues until today. Amazon just lost a few sales today too. With a company of this magnitude, this is ridiculous. Guess I'll be shopping on Overstock instead."
App is a complete mess. It's so cluttered and full of random categories/sections that nobody would ever use and giant panels that take up the entire screen with just one product. Why do I need to scroll through 20 varieties of recommendation lists just to get to the reviews? It's the only app I've used in almost a decade that consistently lags because of all the useless junk it has to load in. I was looking for something and just stopped and went elsewhere because the experience is so bad
"The app browsing experience itself is pretty good, but throwing ""Buy prime now"" in my face upon opening - as per traditional predatory Amazon marketing methods - was a sure way to make me remove it. If they actually started to not pester and trick (free Prime, absolutely free, not really, are you sure you want to lose your benefits, are you absolutely sure?) people into subscribing, I might actually rate it higher. Edit: basket functionality, broken worse than website experience"
"I have had no bad experience with Amazon, not only from shopping and shipping, but also being a prime member for several years now. Sure there are other online stores who sell items cheaper but it shows not only in the quality of merchandise but all the way to the packaging. Amazon is clearly the best choice all around. Thanks Amazon!!"
"I enjoy shopping on Amazon, the reviews are hit or miss but if you do your homework and know exactly what you want, you'll have your order quickly and accurately! I have had good experiences with returns as well. I've done both the refund options, I prefer the account option. It's quicker and will inevitably use the money on my next purchase anyway."
"In general I've had good experiences using Amazon, but recently the app does not notify me when something is on the way or when it's delivered. I checked my settings and all notifications for this app are turned on, so I'm not sure why I don't get alerts. This morning I had groceries delivered and I received no notifications that they were on the way, much less delivered. Had I not went and checked the app manually, my groceries would have sat out and thawed/spoiled. Not good."
"Generally the Amazon experience is good, but the app has begun inserting adds into my purchase history, this is annoying and there is no signposting as to how to stop it. There is also seemingly no method of leaving feedback or asking questions about app functionality in the app. If I'm wrong or simply missing the option I would appreciate feedback."
"overall all the app is useful but extremely inefficient. I like the buy now and lists feature but... Organization is about as good as teenager's cluttered room. The entire interface is all over the place with no sound logic to it and lacks standardization. The absolute worst is canceling a subscription - recently my kids ordered a subscription and of course you can't cancel it though the app, you have to go to the desktop to manage your subscriptions - talk about terrible customer service"
"Had to stop using. Amazon drivers seem to not be able to find my address and delivers to my neighbor who keeps my package. So frustrating. USPS, FedEx, UPS, Walmart+.... All find my address just fine.... But Amazon..... Nope! In fairness...the app is great...prices are great...been using for years.... But Amazon Drivers ruin the experience. So sad. I have spent $1,000s with them."
"I've waited until I had a decent amount of orders before making a review. My experience is 50/50. Some orders were filled with items of the wrong color or patterns ( phone case and a tool bag.) a pair of shoes I ordered were missing the insoles. The last 2 items I ordered were late. Amazon did a decent job handling the refunds. I will continue to use this app. And hope in the future that the items I order will be correct and on time, but if they aren't I know Amazon will make it right."
"App is getting slow, is not responding when adding items into the lists or removing items from the car, you need to restart the app multiple times until it responds. Is an awful experience. UPDATE: I have been trying to order an item for the last 2 days but I can't update my basket to remove couple of items i not longer need. I have ordered the item from Ebay. Prime starts to look like a waste of money."
"They hold orders and won't ship to try to force upgrades to prime. In my experience, the prime trial was dismal at best. All shipments still took almost a week, not a very convincing marketing strategy. You also cannot contact a person to ask anything specific. You just get a BOT that runs you in circles like the toilet that amazon is."
"Absolutely fantastic shopping experience! Amazon never fails to impress me with its vast selection, competitive prices, and lightning-fast delivery. Whether I'm looking for electronics, books, or household essentials, I can always count on Amazon to have what I need. The convenience of Prime shipping is unbeatable, and their customer service is top-notch. I highly recommend Amazon to anyone looking for a seamless online shopping experience!"
This you should be cautious about this app as I had someone trying to scam me out of nearly $1000 and reported it and got nothing done about it. I haven't ever had such a terrible experience with any other businesses before. I ordered only two items which one was delivered within a few days without any issues. The other item was nevertheless ever shipped. Had to cancel my order. Just putting my experience out there so others can see that had occurred to me. Ty
"App is still mixing multiple languages. Just now, I got the 'trade in' notification. Explaining the trade in system in french and german. My app language is english. Why not show me what I want in english! In general, the app keeps showing me things in languages that I have not selected. Very unfriendly user experience."
"Since the last update, my app keeps crashing! I get an error message that tells me to clear my cache but even that doesn't work. Of course, the app doesn't open where I left off before it crashes, so I have to start all over again. My entire shopping experience has been altered."
"Poor experience. The app used to work fine (bit cumbersome if you wanted to change which region you're browsing), but now you can't take screenshots! There's absolutely 0 reason for them to implement that other than causing inconvenience to users."
"My recent experiences with the Amazon app have left me deeply disappointed. I've encountered numerous issues, including receiving damaged items and incorrect products, which indicate serious flaws in Amazon's quality control measures. Additionally, the after-sales support was inadequate and unprofessional, with delayed responses that failed to address my concerns. Amazon's decline in quality has made it the worst e-commerce app I've encountered. Urgent improvements are needed in product quality"
This has now been the worst experience I have EVER had. I ordered a tankless hot water heater from Amazon and Never Received my order. I had to fight with UPS just for UPS to tell me the package was lost. I requested a refund from Amazon and they lied to me and told me I had to wait 24hrs before they could manually send the refund. I call back 24hrs later just to be told it's gonna be 5-7 business days to get my refund. I don't EVER plan to purchase ANYTHING from Amazon EVER Again ! 😡😡
"Worst experience ever!!!!! I mean, for the billions of dollars the corporation makes per hour, you get this... An average Eastern European outsource developer will make a much better product. Awful UX, full of bugs and painfully slow. Add lame suggestion algorithms and you get this app. I just gave up and never finished an order after half an hour confirming some nonsense and the system malfunctioning. It's GARBAGE! Go learn how China does it."
"The app used to be snappy, but since a fee months ago the home page doesn't load. Recently I can't even purchase anything, the checkout screen gets stuck in the process... Really frustrating experience"
"I haven't had one bad experience yet with my orders from Amazon. Even when an order was messed up in any way, Amazon never gave me a hard time returning it and make it right. The only other online service that has been this good is Seamless with food deliveries."
My experience so far with Amazon has been very pleasant. I buy constantly for my wife as well as my daughter and myself quite frequently. I usually purchase magic the gathering cards from people like me and you. I'm putting all my trust into the sellers. I've purchased from sellers like this countless times and although the packages come late sometimes I've had no complaints. Amazon service is very great. I'm not even a prime member and service is great.
Can't actually believe the experience I've had ordering Morrisons groceries via Amazon tonight like I've used before. UI is bad enough but now you can't delete items once added to an order! I've done it before! But after 50mins with Customer service I was told no it wasn't possible and they wouldn't do it either! They said to just cancel the whole order. But I needed my shopping. Disgusted I'd give zero stars if I could. They shouldn't offer Morrisons if they can't support it professionally.
I am very happy with my Amazon shopping experience. The costs and wide range of availability of products is good and the alternatives that are also shown when searching is useful. Delivery times and alternative delivery options such as lockers are also good. It is a shame that they are unable to manage the delivery drivers who are often a huge let down. Packaging is good as well. Returns and refunds are managed in a simple and prompt way. Customer Services usually resolve matters well.
"Amazon Shopping app offers convenience at your fingertips with its vast selection and speedy delivery. Its intuitive interface makes browsing and purchasing a breeze. However, occasional glitches during checkout can be frustrating. Overall, a must-have for seamless online shopping experiences."
"How long did it take Google to allow Amazon app? I remember I had to slide load the app through apk due to Google being evil. Anyways, I'm happy now we all can experience the #1 shopping app on earth. It have its bugs here and there that I notice but whatever. It's fluid and I never had any issues. Thanks Google for allowing Amazon app to be on Play Store 😁"
"Price is not as competitive in general. What I dislike is that international shipping (from US or UK) most likely will be delayed by a month from my experience. Prime subscription doesn't guarantee fast international shipping. However, local shipping is fine though so far. Last place for me to look for stuff online, really."
"Amazon has been the WORST online experience I have ever encountered. Checkout is a NIGHTMARE. You WAST all your time shopping only to checkout and have the majority of your order canceled due to ""unavailable items"" but it does not say that when you are shopping. There is no way to know what happened to your order without calling customer service. Customer service is RUDE they have no professional ethic at all. Security for your cards is HIGHLY questionable. EBAY is a far better experience."
I don't like how all the in app shortcuts (sharing with friends) are all ios based. So when I go to share an item it's the ios messaging icon instead of the icon of my messaging app on my android phone. Small thing but very disruptive to the flow of the app and the fact that it's a new issue. Not everyone wants an iPhone or an ios experience.
"Amazon offers a remarkable shopping experience. The prices are reasonable, and the delivery is prompt and convenient, right to your doorstep. In my extensive years of online shopping with Amazon, I have encountered only one issue, which was promptly resolved by their efficient customer service. The platform is user-friendly and provides a seamless shopping experience."
I love the ease of shopping online and the quality customer experience. I only took a star away because I believe Amazon should check their sellers a little more closely. Some of the seller qualities are inconsistent. it is always best to check reviews on the products and the return policy.
"In the past few months, I've noticed a huge shift in my orders being farther and farther from the promised 2 day shipping they used to be. I don't watch much prime TV or listen to much prime music. Honestly, the ONLY reason I have Prime is because I wanted the two day shipping. Now, I am not even getting that. Step it up AMAZON. Severely disappointed here and I know I am not the only one who has noticed. My friends, family and neighbors have all had the same experiences."
The new re-design shortcuts list is nice. Love the new clock icon for all your previous orders. Makes it easier to find your lists & everything you're looking for. Continue to update for design improvements for a better customer experience....
"Fantastic app experience and fabulous quality of products. I've only had 1 bad experience in the 10 years that I've been using the Amazon shopping App. What happened was that I had ordered DC Men's Fusion Globes shoes in a size UK 11, but a UK size 8 DC Men's Fusion Globes shoes was delivered. Unfortunately I couldn't return my order as it was a gift I purchased 2 months in advance for my husband's birthday so I didn't know that the wrong size had been delivered until he opened the package."
"Mostly cheap lower quality items mass produced in China. It's hard to find quality well known branded items. Amazon always pushes cheap knock-offs from unknown brands over the well known brands. I can't fault their logistics or ease of returns, they are the best out there for that, but the products they mainly sell are of inferior quality in my experience. They also pay little to no tax through various loop holes, which is an absolute joke for such a massive international company."
"Changing shipping address is impossible unless you cancelled the order, even if it wasn't shipped yet.. I put my order on the wrong address and now i have to wait for at least 3 days to get the refund and then reorder. Customer service is so bad i can't get anyone to resolve this issue. Very bad experience"
"The customer service was not very helpful and very slow in taking action for my problem. Now my package is missing, and the customer service said it was my problem. The customer service is so rude!!! I will not order here anymore; it's ok to pay more than treat me like this. Respect the customer. I am hoping they will not do this to other customers. Having a bad experience with your service, I will encourage my friends to not support this Amazon anymore. The customer service should be very helpf"
"After 4 years of experience as a prime member, I can confidently make this review to help save someone else from what I've been through. The service has been simply horrid. From being charged for orders that were returned; shipments arriving a week late; Amazon blatantly lying to me about my orders and ETA's; being forced to do the investigating regarding my missing items while being lied to by Amazon; their devices forcefully broadcasting my privacy, data AND MY ISP ITSELF without my consent."
"I can't sign in to my account because i don't receive the opt on my phone, i called the customer service and they said u have to wait cause they are facing problems with otp (I've been waiting for 4 days until now and the problem still unfixed)or i should send them my government id (i refused cause its so private) which will take 3 to 4 until i can sign in again. Unfortunately, So bad experience with AMAZON. 😔😔😔😔"
"Would give 0 stars if a could. Over 5 years of paying for Amazon prime and now all of a sudden they weren't making ENOUGH money they have to fill my content on prime video with ADS???!!! It's too bad the developers have made a wonderful app, only to have the experience messed up by Jeff bezos."
Experience was horrible. I tried buying something with my card and the account got locked cause I couldn't remember my password. I go to reset my password with my email and I've entered the correct OTP and it doesn't ever work. Amazon sucks.
"I don't know why every time I order something, my orders are delayed. This is the third time this week, I'm not paying Prime membership monthly to get this kind experience. In my 18 years ordering on Amazon as a primer member, I'm upset, I know the weather can complicate the delivery, but Amazon should do something to ensure no weather affects them. DON'T abuse employees as part of the solution so orders are arrived on time, there's other solutions I know cuz I used to work on AVP1"
"Used to use the app constantly, now the most recent update has made it completely unusable, I can't access and account settings or preferences, my entire order history and lists seemingly don't exist anymore and the new profile feature is just stupid and useless. Ive resorted to using the web browser entirely now. Really hope they roll back these changes and just give us the opd version back, which in my experience worked just fine and was very similar to the web experience. Unfortunate..."
"Every order arrives at my door within a few days. Return policy is the best. I have ordered the wrong item being my fault and was able to return the item no questions asked. It's the best shopping experience and the products are usually readily available. Really, you can't go wrong. I always tell it like it is. I am not going to say a product is good if it isn't."
"Honestly, don't start. Amazon hurts everyone in the long run. The app gets a passing grade.... on a good day. On most other days, it gets an F, for the following reasons: 1. Unintuitive user interface. 2. Makes it difficult to contact customer service. 3. Pushes amazon's own brands way too hard, and those are usually cheaper because of a much lower quality. 4. Products ordered usually come within 2 days of the promised time. 5. Too many internal ads. One or two is fine."
"I love Amazon, but I'm not a fan of how they package and consolidate/separate items for the same order (at least in the US). Due to packaging mismatch, at least 4 in every 10 orders will have some kind of damage. Those paper/plastic flyer bags do not protect the items when the courier company combines them with other heavy boxes or weirdly shaped orders, then just mixed in a sack. There should be an option for packaging type, especially boxes. My recent experiences have not been satisfactory. 🥲"
"Revolting customer support experience. The app randomly redirects you to the home page when you're chatting to an operator, and there's absolutely no way to get back to the conversation. The support itself is often frustrating as well. Had a problem with my Prime Video account, got bounced 3 times by operators, and got randomly assigned to an extremely rude German one who didn't even try to solve the issue."
"I don't know what they did with their latest updates. But ever since they incorporated AI into the app, it's laggy and stutters all the time. Not a smooth experience At all."
"You changed the orders page, so now I don't know what is arriving or has been delivered today. I have items that are months out and now they are pushed back several pages. I am part of the Vine program, so don't make the interface difficult for us."
"I just wish wish wish they stop messing around with the interface! Since adding 3d previews, the app is basically useless. Non responsive."
"I've been using Amazon for several years, it's now my ""go to place"" for finding anything. They have everything from groceries to medication and If you pay for their prime membership you'll get access to perks and free shipping on most orders. You're able to track the location of your orders right in the app and most items are delivered within a few days. I've had a couple of experiences with lost packages and Amazon sent out the replacement without delay. I saved almost 1000 with Amazon in 2023!"
"This app is a staple in my life. Lately, I've been let down with the quality of the browsing experience. The app keeps crashing. The screen just freezes, you can't scroll, use the back button, nothing. I have to force close and start again, It's so frustrating. I have s23 ultra if that helps. Someone, please do something about it. I'm surprised it's not been fixed by now. While ya at it, do something about the search function. It's terrible..."
"The Amazon shopping app is one amazing app, of a kind, it delivers the best shopping experience possible and provides links to countless functionalities which are not possible to recount here!"
"Can you assist me in sorting this quandary out? I pay for an Amazon Prime subscription. I use the shopping, books, and video perks. Amazon Video is now, today, hitting me up for MORE money if I want to keep watching WITHOUT ads. Soon my already paid for subscription will dump in advertising unless I pay up MORE Money. It smacks of Double Taxation! If you want to hold the audience hostage to advertising....Then separate it from my Amazon Shopping experience and charge separately for a separateApp"
"Don't order often but have been sent wrong item twice. Of course, items sent were worth less & sub optimal. Amazon also removed my ability 2 leave review 4 items. So I came here. I have better experience w/ eebay"
"Terrible app interface, not intuitive. Adding an email for example takes forever and requires too many steps. The shop itself is good though"
"Horrible experience. Driver just left my package outside my door. I was at home the whole day and no one bothered to call or message me on whatsapp. Worst part is liquids were all over inside the box, Milk formula Cans were damaged, all items were sticky because of the fluids coming from the handwash, toothpaste were out of their boxes and both oackageing are damaged. no bubble wrap or any form of protection at all. It looks like all items were just put inside the box with 0 care. Never again."
"Shopping experience is decent, but any account information is impossible to find and change, I know what email I used to register but can't find it to change it, I can find my phone number to change it. Seems likes there's nothing I can do about it."
"App is fine, even shopping experience was ok, but the worst part is delivery guys. Before there were guys who call or message and confirm if ur available. Bcos they will mostly say before 9pm. But recent few purchases this guy doesn't message or call. Won't even know when he's coming and morover he just rings the bell leaves the item at door and goes. By the time we open no one will be there. In case if no one's at home, what will happen? The package is lying there unattended or if stolen then?"
"It's alright. I would prefer a more user friendly interface when shopping kind of like the Walmart app. Would be nice if everything was uniform, pretty and easy to understand. I'm currently pregnant and finding my registry took me over 10 minutes. For some reason after clicking a hundred buttons and scrolling through page after page to get to it, it's separated in different categories instead of on one list that everything is on."
"I used to love the Amazon app- it was 5 star user experience for me (never any issues with the app, no issues with payment and delivery, etc). My love for the app lasted until today. The app updated and now there's an ""inspire"" feature that is Amazon's version of tiktok/Instagram. I will be using Amazon less often so I don't feel like I'm shopping from some social media platform. I can't get rid of this feature. If there's a way to remove it, please let me know :("
shopping on Amazon is the most incredible shopping experience anything you want it's their you just got to type it in it's convenient and even when the store is closed and you need something right away it's there for you thank you Amazon
"Latest update added a ""search Amazon"" and ""Amazon shopping"" context when selecting text in every app, system-wide. That is malware behavior. Amazon can die in a fire for changing an essential core function behavior of tens of millions of mobile devices, and Google/Android/Samsung are even worse for allowing an app to make a change to the entire UI interface without requiring prompting and requiring explicit permission while also not giving customers a way to disable or remove it. DIGUSTING!"
"Interface is unintuitive, and app is poorly optimized. Interface is SO clunky and can often be quite slow. Nothing is smooth, and half the buttons don't animate when you click them. For one of the most powerful companies in the world, they really could be doing better here."
"Unnecessarily complicated. There must be 40 different Amazon apps. How do I know which one is right? All I need to do is pay for an order with Visa gift cards, but this seems to be impossible without getting a college degree in navigating Amazon's various user interfaces. I regret every precious and irredeemable second I've spent in this desolate consumerist wasteland. God help us"
awesome experience. camera search is great. either pulls up the item I want or gets close enough for me to find it.
"Amazon is fine overall, but there's definitely room for improvement. One feature I believe would greatly enhance the user experience is the addition of a ""Recommended"" page. It would be incredibly helpful to have a dedicated section where the app suggests items similar to those I've viewed or purchased. This would make browsing and discovering new products much more convenient and tailored to my interests."
"Stop changing the interface every update. It's frustrating even for those who are tech savvy, even more for those who aren't. I'm tired of having to re-teach my grandparents how to use this app again. Wishlists are broken, filters applied to show unpurchased yet it shows everything anyways. Our family received many duplicate items for Christmas because of this and now we all have to return multiple items."
Bad experience cancelled a order they took my money out of my account and refunded to refund me wouldn't recommend keep coming up with excuses. BETTER OFF WITH EBAY
"Subpar experience compared to using a web browser. I can't do half of the things I do using a web browser without jumping through a ton of hoops. I'm unable to go to the ""Online Return Center"" in the app since it sends me to my orders which for some reason doesn't not have updated return information."
"Update on this problem, if I save a product to the wishlist I see the little screen with my named wishlist, but that named wishlist is not visible in the app, it has only different products from a long time ago. ‼️Updates didn't correct my problem with the wishlist. Oh and the prices in the app are not the same as shown in the website interface. 😁🤔🧩 This wishlist is totally not the same as I use with the web online interface. 🤔Hmmm please a response is highly appreciated thank you."
"Pros: Best online shopping experiences since the Covid lock down (in USA). Always delivers, always on time. Have had minimal issues that were quickly resolved through the outstanding customer service representatives. Cons: Need to shop wisely when searching for products. They must be fair and reasonably priced. Some sellers are selling same items at highly inflated prices. Have to check ratings, feed back, and photos to determine if the item is as described and what you're looking for."
Amazon is really great! Good shopping experience & if anything goes wrong they are helping dealing with issues or refunds quickly.
Do not use try before you buy! They will charge you and deny that it was try before you buy and fight you on the return. I spoke with several Representatives that all had a different story that did not match the rules on the website. I even had one representative hang up on me when I called for help. Worst experience on Amazon to date.
Frustrating what I wanted to buy wouldn't ship to Australia. If I'm shopping in the USA and I live in Australia why wait till I've bought it to tell me that. Jeff I know by cutting out the smaller sellers you make more money. It was the smaller sellers that made Amazon the best shopping experience. Oh well you'll be able to buy another yacht but Elon's still beating you in the space race
"The way Amazon charges for orders that has items shipping at different times makes it very difficult to track amazon spend on ur credit card. What makes this experience even worse is that there is no option to download order history report as .csv file. That feature was available but Amazon removed. Amazon BRING BACK ""DOWNLOAD ORDER HISTORY REPORT"" Telling us to request order history which can take up to 30 days is very -ve user experience"
"High price, ad heavy starting 1/29/2024 unless YOU PAY UP! We consumers are sick to death of ads, and THIS household hates anything with ads. We make a point of NEVER BUYING anything featured in an ad. That's easy to do. Amazon Prime is about to price itself out of the market. No amount of ""benefits"" fix it. Oh, and the Amazon video smartTV interface SUCKS THE SEPTIC TANK DRY for innovative, user friendly design. Amazon Customer Service SUCKS EVEN MORE MASSIVELY!!! Can't give 0 stars, sadly."
"The app shopping experience could be better if Amazon didn't use deceitful shipping dates, etc. When ordering, the initial delivery date states one day but, a few hours later, shows a day or two later even with a prime membership since 2005. I would say use at your own risk.. Amazon isn't the only game in town any longer!"
My recent experience with customer care was bad. They keep revising my order delivery date. On top they dont reply to what u ask and also they leave the conversation in between or just transfer it to another team member. They dont provide any follow up to customer and even the instruction they add to system is useless. They dont provide any email id to escalate the issue. No compensation policy . Useless customer care.
"Such a badly developed app. 1) Can't save Paynow QR code directly from the app lol, it redirects me to browser where I have to re log into amazon and download the QR there 2) while I'm trying to add new address, my inputs are reset everytime I switch the app to check on the details. Had to rekey everytime? 3) Doesn't allow screenshotting my order and payment page ( I know there's security policies but it's stupid) This is just my experience from doing one order. Even Shopee app is better, lol"
"excellent shopping experience. I check prices with several others before purchasing, most of the time, amazon is very competitive. There delivery time just leaves the competition behind, though. I've never waited more than 48 hours for a parcel. 5 ⭐️ Amazon"
"So...my shipping experience with Amazon is definitely the full 5 stars. Where they've lost? Sometime, around 3+ years ago, someone decided my review ""wernt against commity standars""?? I read and reread what did written! All true. No paid for positive recommendation. Nothing that I'd not like my Great Grands to read. Yet, Amazon sends me requests each purpose to rate the vendor!"
"I returned the item, and the order was delivered to the seller. It has been more than three months. But I'm still waiting for my money back. I contacted amazon customer service many more times. But no anyoutcome. Worst experience I ever had. They just tell the same things again again. Our team will contact you in the next two weeks, in the next 48 hours, but nobody will contact you. So, while you return the items, please be careful. Thank you."
Just want to get things shipped over seas to the military base. I never had a worse experience trying to shop online. The customer service is insanely hard to use. They told me they dont know what to do and to just make another account. Now that I have another account it gets put on hold and wont tell me how to verify. And I cant login and verify because when I try to log in it tells me your account is on hold.
Spammy notifications and no option to unsubscribe from certain email dispatch notifications which should be illegal and banned 👎 the constant interface changes also ruining both the app and the site...
"What a disappointing experience. I ordered a couple of items, took forever to arrive. And after numerous phone calls, the last and most important items to arrive comes pre damaged. Now I have to wait weeks for a refund! Amazon shopping sucks! Terrible service. Terrible policies. Worst customer service ever. Not happy!😡"
"Not sure what's going on lately, but over the last 5 days or so using the app on Android is horrible. The app freezes the entire phone. Scrolling locks and the experience is very glitchy and bad. I have over 120 apps on my phone and at the moment Amazon app is the ONLY one acting up like this. Jeff, Please fix it! 😂"
"everything works fine until a package gets delayed and it's impossible to cancel it and does not give you an option, horrible experience."
"great online shopping experience but returns can be a bit annoying sometimes , but usually it depends how you purchased your product thru Amazon"
Rufus is just another bandwidth hog. Prime is not worth it since developers do not care for the user experience. Its like Amazon only hires low grade developers who can't fix issues. Infact I'm convinced they purposely code the problems in.
Great shopping experience so far. Easy to return if item isn't correct or what I wanted exactly. Shopping made easy!
"Broken app, doesn't contact Amazon support when you go through the order you need support for, diverts back to order page. Wanted to write a seller review and pressed the name of seller but it put me on the page of most recent seller product. Accidentally wrote review for wrong seller as a result, no way to check and reverse. Besides it's slow, gloated, and has dozens of categories in your account to sift through. Poor shopping experience especially compared to some other major retailers"
Although Amazon is one of the biggest richest companies in the world it's customer service is yet to be desired. Their shipping is the most horrible experience in the world and needs an overhaul. Packaging of fragile items should be packaged a lot better. All packages should have tracking and signature upon arrival by purchaser there'd be no more packages in transit being stolen or fake deliveries being marked yet never delivered.
"The app is ok except for one feature it's missing. It sorely needs its own native dark mode capability. I can enable my phone's own dark mode to compensate, but it's not the same as the app providing that user interface. Other shopping apps have this, why can't Amazon's IT application development group add this feature as an option in the app settings? Include it and rating will change to 5 stars."
I love Amazon...so many products and great delivery options! I also was a delivery driver for 4 years and had a great experience!
Honestly Amazon isn't as good as it used to be prime isn't one day or same day delivery anymore their customer service is very rude they ignore you and promise you things but they never fullfil them I'm very disappointed and will probably cancel prime because of this experience :(
The experience with support has been abismal. Every experience on the phone it's like they are not even listening to you.
good ease of use with amazon shopping app. abundance of products to shop from. overall great experience as an online shopper with amazon.
"I've been using the Amazon Shopping app for a while now, and it's become an essential part of my life, especially given my situation. It's incredibly convenient for ordering products I need without having to leave home. The user interface is easy to navigate, and I appreciate the extensive range of products available. However, I'd like to see some improvements in terms of accessibility and mental health support features within the app. Overall, it's a valuable tool for online shopping."
"Give me a dark mode. Update, inexplicably, still no dark mode. Also, sharing a product is a massive hassle with the new interface instead of the native android menu or anything like it, so thanks for making your app even worse."
"I am very happy and satisfied with my shopping experience with Amazon. The site is user friendly and I can purchase just about anything that my heart desires. I also love their subscribe and save option. I can get things that I buy on the regular come to me automatically when I need them. The best part is that all the items are discounted in price just for using this service. With everything being so expensive nowadays, it really helps! Thanks Amazon 👍👍"
"Amazon search bumped select all and copy from my text selection context literally broke my mobile phone experience, I copy, paste, select all, all day long on my phone, having to select text, then click another 3 dots to find copy, paste and select all made using the phone obnoxious to use for anything but mindless scrolling. So my question remains, is this limited to Samsung android users? Is this a change One UI allows that stock Android doesn't? Did Amazon have to get permission or pay Samsun"
"Worst experience with customer service representatives, I placed a laptop order from Amazon, after 11 days also order not shipped.when I call customer care, one agent saying seller left the platform, other agent tells we are trying to contact the seller,wait for 48 hours or cancel the order to get refund.Looks like they do not have the correct information Horrible experience.I will never place order with them again."
"Please fix the bug that occasionally the currency automatically switched back to US$ instead of my choice, and I found nowhere to reset that as the interface for resetting (with a flag at top roght corner) sometimes disappear."
"Got sent the wrong colour item. Amazon customer service keep passing me off from one person to the next and hanging the phone up on me mid conversation. I reported the wrong item on 22 February and I am still waiting for someone to arrange a refund. The joke is amazon say ""Your feedback is helping us build Earth's Most Customer-Centric Company."" This is by far the worst customer experience I have ever received."
Not always the lowest price. Don't think the experience would be the same without Prime. Delivery should only occur during daylight hours for the employees sake.
"Very Bad Experience, not the first time to get a wrong item from Amazon And I have to wait for the hassle to return the item and try to get my money back I will never use this app again to buy any stuff Its a waste of time and money"
I been using the app for more than 3 years but I experience some problems when I chose to buy something don't give the option to pay and then I can't buy nothing
I've only had one bad experience. I ordered some mallo cups and they were old . Other than that I've been rather Happy w my purchases.
"Worst service!!! i have ever experienced. No responsibility in order shipping, they will never deliver the shipments on time. Bad experience!"
"For God sake do not order from Amazon ,he deals with computer scammers companies , I had very bad experience with Azteccomputers, please go to best buy , they are masters helping and good deals, and u can change and get refund easily"
"This app and service is horrible. I pay for prime and rearly. I mean very rearly do I get my delivery on time and when it delivered it just left outside my door without ringing the ring camera which I have. This is a huge company but I would never recommend this type of bad service I get from them to anyone. I have a way better experience and expected delivery time using ebay and other apps. This app is horrible, and don't bother paying for prime because it's a waste of your money and time."
"⛔ BAD BAD BAD - Like MANY others.. I find it buggy, slow to browse through, it crashes forcing me to restart, I often lose what I was looking at as the page suddenly switches to homepage. Review videos either are slow to load or simply can't be seen. Notifications, filitering searches are also problematic. Becoming a Prime Member is forced and is often sneakily embedded in ordering process - IN SHORT?... it has become a 'BAD USER EXPERIENCE' and near EVERY aspect of it's use is depressing! 🤦‍♂️"
"The app is very disfunctional, plenty of bugs, it is a quest to find any function, and the user experience is really poor. Of course one ""has to"" use it to access to Amazon services. Maybe the company thinks that it is a good strategy to make user experience horrible through cheap developments? Not sure where it comes from."
"Seems to me that when a company drastically increases their fee for membership, there is an expectation of a higher level of service. In my experience, shipping times have gotten worse.... longer than promised. ""Free two day shipping with Prime."" When was the last time you got something in 2 days? Or "" order now and receive by ""x"". Every time I order something, it's 3 days or more. More often than not, there are delays. Amazon was faster when warehouses were further away."
I like the app but tried the free trial of premium but when I canceled it I had to do it 3 times which itself was a difficult and annoying experience and when I did I still got charged for it and had to manually cancel through another service because they still had me on their pay list.
"I am very satisfied with my experiences with Amazon Shopping. Even during the busy Christmas season, I received all my purchases on time and in great condition. I am a continuing returning customer. Thank you, Amazon, for years of great service, wide variety, and quality products!"
"I've pretty much never had a good experience with Amazon, ever. I live in a rural area, so my packages get ""lost,"" delayed, and just outright never delivered almost every time I purchase. Really disappointed."
"The Amazon app is incredibly user-friendly, making online shopping a breeze. Its seamless interface and intuitive design enhance the overall shopping experience. Additionally, the integration with Whole Foods provides excellent functionality, allowing for a convenient and efficient grocery shopping experience."
If only i could put zero rating! First ever order i made yesterday and it was deliver today.. So horrible experienced. Worth £64 of JBL headphone and they pack in the parcel a frosting cake dummy that worth like less than a pound! I mean yes we could make mistake but it's just one item order and they just replaced it with a stupid item! I really felt scammed! Poor me no choice! Now I am facing the hussle of returning it and I don't know if they have the heart to refund me
"Bad and slow. I have a fast phone, but everything takes ages when using this app. It's weird that a billion dollar company can't offer a better app experience - any struggling startup could do better."
Great shopping with Amazon fast delivery and no problems with returns. good quality items. But be aware if shoes and clothing the sz are wrong. In my experience bit smaller than I expected
"Worst, most inconsiderate customer service. They ruined my Christmas order and covered it with lies and excuses. Prime is a scam as nothing is guaranteed- especially orders. I wanted a simple order update and they claimed I rejected delivery, then they tried telling me I requested a refund, THEN the lie was the package w as lost- meanwhile it had just been scanned into new orleans previous day. Done against my knowledge and consent. Worst experience- emotionally devastating."
"Getting really sick of the interface/layout changing so much. Why even have lists if we can't get to em? Now I can't reach all my lists... Can't make the all show, so can't access certain lists. Very frustrating.."
Bad experience. I had a gift card and I was looking for its claim code but the app and the website displayed it nowhere. I lost the card.
"Horrible experience, people shouldn't use this one. It's way better if you decided for AliExpress who really cares about your package and your money cause they already charged my debit card y and I've been waiting for days and the reps just keep telling me lies."
"The latest update where the filters became bubbles is as unnecessary and unwanted as a change could be. There is no more sort option. Amazon has proven that the users and their experience and preferences don't matter, only what Amazon wants to promote. It really is time to find another shopping default. The app was marginally useful before but now the displayed results are untrustworthy and assume to be more expensive items."

For some reason you can't buy Amazon Prime videos through this app. The interface will show you the movie but there's no button to actually buy (or rent) it! I have to use my laptop.
I told them I didn't receive my package and they made it seem like I was lying. I've talked to six people about my item and the fourth person said I was gonna receive a confirmation email refund I didn't receive anything I talked to 2 more people and they said they can't do anything sorry. Like wow this is the worst delivering app possible I've never had any problems but this is by far the worst 💯 hope you all have a different experience then I had with them.
Very bad experience can't receive any otp can't buy the item every time I create password he tell me rong password 🙃 I'm new on Amazone and can't buying anything !😡😠
"Absolute piece of garbage. Randomly removed my precious orders which is completely unacceptable. Interface feels like it's developed by someone who has a personal grudge against me.. I have to go into all orders (which doesn't take me to all orders just the ones in the last three months) then filter, THEN choose ONLY 1 period to see the orders made in it? How can this even pass by the QA of a company of this size?"
Experience calling customer service is absolutely terrible. the young lady oversees had me on hold for about an hour just to check to see if the order went through. I end up hanging up and I did not say I did not receive a call back. I was not expecting one because the service was terrible. If a company makes over let's say 10 billion dollars a year why can't they get people to work in the call center in the United States. So the paying customer(Me and who ever lives in America) can communicate
"I wish there was an option for zero stars. Very unsatisfied client. Terminated account due to a stupid reason. Giving hope it can be open again then just terminating it. No refund for the gift cards I used (25€) stuck on that terminated account. Been trying to open it for months. Since I get no refund, the gift cards on that account can't be used. Very terrible experience."
Amazon makes the whole shopping experience pleasurable. We use them a lot!!
The app works fine its the overall experience with amazon. Packages dont arrive within the 2 day period not worth the paying for the membership and adds on prime video after your paying for membership. Not worth the price
"Sorry to say this. But not a good experience at all. I just want to claim my gift card, so I ordered something.1st order Not delivered have to cancel. 2nd order Not delivered have to cancel. 3rd time Not delivered tried to call the delivery guy thousand times. Cancelled delivery for 2 days in a row. And guess what. It was on hold. For 7 days because the delivery attempt was not successful. Contacted the customer service automated through call. Tried the chat? He kept saying things again & again"
"TERRIBLE UPDATE. I can't say anything good about the search capabilities. No sorting options anymore. Buttons for Filter options must be designed for children ordering. If this is the type of shopping experience that Amazon wants us to have, then I won't be buying much. Priorities for me are 1) being able to find what you want, quickly 2) easy access to your account (orders, returns, and reviews) and 3) find account settings easily."
"Tablets and tabs. What a bad experience when installing and opening on a tablet. It simply says its not longer supported and directs you to use the browser. Back when it did work, of makes the same old mistake as several other shopping apps and doesn't have a way to compare two items easily. So in fact, I will go back to using a web browser where i can open items I'm comparing in different tabs. Good riddance."
"Amazon is hurting their vendors and customers. Absolutely the worst online shopping experience ever. Horribly distracting autoplay videos everywhere, on each listing, and they can't be disabled. The moment you look at a still image of a product, even a thumbnail, it starts playing a video instead. Rumors say Amazon charges vendors extra for this, so the only one benefitting from this is Amazon. I uninstalled this garbage immediately, and am happy to shop elsewhere. Just use your browser."
"Amazon has become a miserable shopping experience. Riddled with scam listings and false advertising, swamped with incredibly low-quality Chinese products that fall apart quickly if they ever fit/worked correctly in the first place and usually take more than 2 days to arrive, even using Prime shipping, and consistent delays in shipping and problems with payments, make Amazon nearly unusable anymore. It is certainly not worth paying for a Prime membership. It's a real shame. They've gotten too big"
"My experience has been abysmal and horrific forever. Either I receive the wrong item, a damaged item, an item that's description misrepresents what the product can do, an item that is not delivered when promised and/or just horrific customer service in general. Of course it would help if Amazon didn't outsource their customer service to Pakistan. I wish there was negative stars."
Never a good experience.Paid on time but can not access on line ordering..Terrible Experience for a senior With excellent credit
Clean up the user interface. Lots of junk is shown when I make a specific search.
As per my experience Amazon is a worldwide store and in my country there are items that are not necessary and that I don't need so I give it a 2 star
I really need someone from Amazon who is willing to help me to get in touch with me I am having a horrible experience with the agents who keep transferring me with noone fixing my problem with my order please posting on play store is now pure desperation
Worst experience ever if I can make a zero rating I would do... delivery went to a wrong address so I told him check the address again it's correct in the order and contacted the customer service spoke with 4 people and no one assisted me at all then requested to speak to a manager and he was like a robot... I begged them to assist me in getting the order today or even I can go myself to collect it from the warehouse and no one cared at all... will never use the app again.
"Worst experience ever. I have been waiting for my package, and it's already a week late. Customer Service can't provide me an answer, they just give me 5€ vouchers... Where is my package??? This was an extremely disappointed experience."
I have always had a very positive experience with Amazon. I expect no less from Amazon and it affiliates.
"Rather disappointing experience compared to desktop browser (which is not flowless either). It's extremely difficult to search products by a specific category since many of them are burried deep inside other less relevant categories. Filtering is also a mess. There's no way to choose a specific price range and/or multiple brands. In addition, it's impossible to leave the seller's feedback after purchasing(!). Overall, it is usable, but sometimes it's easier to switch to a desktop browser..."
The app resets page settings if the phone goes to standby or if takes too long to enter input data. You would expect a better experience from an Amazon app. Haven't encountered other problems.
"S23 Ultra woes here since UI6 update. BEWARE! YES, EVERYTHING IS GLITCHY BUT.....today I experienced a small disaster. I went to purchase 1 item from its landing page only to have the app glitch freeze and then send through ALL 53 items in my cart! All the items were under consideration for my new home, but I repeat, I was NOT in my cart. And they all went through on separate orders. Customer service cancelled the orders but CAVEAT EMPTOR until they get this fixed. Try the computer instead."
Very bad delivery experience. They threw the package above the boundary wall and hit the window without even trying to ring the bell or call. this bad behavior could have caused a serious injury if it fell on someone's head or damage the product. I complained to amazon but did nothing to me.
Very stupid app... Full of ads that destorts your shopping experience and mix up the prices u see...... Further more it's designed to make u pay more am item and make it hard to reach better options. Its hard to search for what u need since it keeps adding item that r totally irrelevant.
"' Uh-Oh, Something Went Wrong At Our End' - the error we're all getting every 2min is so satirically funny ..what have you done to this app?!. 😵‍💫 The amount of £ this company makes and yet unwilling to provide their customers with a smooth purchasing experience. I know you want our money bc u keep upping Prime and now want extra £3 for ad-free but you can't make a basic shopping app work? Lmao I've been a member since Prime trial days eons ago but we're parting ways soon boo."
This app sucks and really slow. Lots of times it will not load my orders and all other apps and browsers on my phone works. When pages do load the interface is very slow
Too poor experience. I ordered an item on Novemer 27th 2023 but they didnt delivered till 25th january 2024. At last they told me we didnt deliver impossible. If it is possible to give in negative rating then i will be happy to give them but playstore not allow to give less than 1 star. Even they didnt gave me a compession. Temu and aliexpress are far better than amazon.
This app is no longer showing on my phone or can find it using app search on my phone! The only way I can open it up is to come to the Google Play store to open it up from here ?! Very strange and not a great user experience? I will probably just delete it and just use browser.
It has a pop up when text is selected to search Amazon and that is fully unnecessary functionality. It gets in the way and is horrible use experience.
Worst experience ever. Never using it again. I ordered so many gifts for my 2 girls for Xmas. As a single mom i have to save or I wouldn't be able to do Xmas. I ordered nov 19th November 21st they said 3 of my orders (6 of the main gifts) were undeliverable due to damage said wait 2 weeks for it to be returned n I'll get my refund. Now they r telling me nothing they can do and to wait til Dec 28th. So they ruined Xmas cuz I had to save that to get the gifts. Worst customer service ever
"Honestly, CS is really good from my personal experience, and now I can't say much for just Amazon bc I haven't really had a problem yet, hopefully. Now, the main topic is Amazon.jp . They are hella friendly and have a great CS team, and they are understanding helpful and, in many ways. I had a problem with my account, and Boom took them less than 4-6 days to help me recover my account for jp Amazon. So thank ya Amazon.jp. Oh but Amazon is good cool too or their CS team is pretty neat from myview"
"too damn bright. Please, would it really take much effort at all to create a dark mode? some of us experience agony in our eyes when presented with a floating white screen. It's a 4 star app but while it continues to inflict such pain it'll be getting a 1 from me"
I hate there customer service but other than that yeah no glitches it's a smooth working experience unless you don't receive a product that you will have to not only contact Amazon but you will have to contact the seller and then if you use your credit card you will need to get ahold of them to get any results
Bad experience. Before when ordering it used to go through a page to choose payment option but now it is in a small box and won't notice and it directly take payment . Very bad trick.
They just get rid of 2 day shipping and then charge you more for their service.. Then you have to now pay an extra $3 if you want an ad free experience on their TV.. Amazon is the devil..
Lately it has been the world's worst experience. Doesn't show me recent orders. And used to payment would automatically come out but now it doesn't 🤬
"Overall I have had great experiences with Amazon UNTIL! One of their Vendors Falsely advertised a product with a video and all how what you would get buying it, Well I paid $40.00 for an Item that was not at all what they advertised so guess what that vendor got a bad review along with pictures of what they sold me and warned people what they see is not what they get, AND I GET PUNISHED BY NOT BEING ABLE TO LEAVE REVIEWS, all the years I bought through them and still do, Shame Amazon"
"Amazon's app used to work well but now 4 out of 5 times I get the ""CS2"" error. Even when clearing cache, uninstalling, restarting my phone and reinstalling the app is it a hit-or-miss on functionality. Just horrible experience in getting it to function. Now, when it rarely does work, it is an enjoyable and useful app - when it works.... when. it. works. My device is a solid performer too. Samsung S21 Ultra with maxed out specs. There ""should be no issue"" here, yet.... there is. Good-luck."
"i have bad experience with amazon, i ordered item and paied for it then i found my account closed and me order didt arrive , no one contacted me, i contacted customer service to fix the issue and they tell me will contact you within 48 hours but no one contacted me, so till this time i am writing this reviw my mone had been tooken and i didnt recive product or support from them"
The question ai no longer shows me questions by other customer or shows me the old pre-ai interface of highlighted words in answered questions and reviews by customers.
"Among the other retailers, Amazon has an exceptional experience. Mature infrastructure and Customer service, return and refund policy make Amazon on the top of the other rivals."
"The worst shopping experience ever, a bunch of liars and poorest customer support, I did not receive a refund yet after 3 times of communication"
"List scrolling is janky. Duplicate items near end of list. Sorting list items doesn't work properly. Doesn't tell Kindle app to download books automatically. No sale notifciations (unless it's a product recommendation). Blocks screenshots past checkout. Can no longer request Kindle editions of books. Also, hope that they don't lock you out of your accout without warning; that was by far the worst experience I've ever had."
Great experience shopping on Amazon. And the fact that one can go back to historical orders several years back is a big plus.
"I recently experienced issues with two orders. Firstly, I received a refund for an order that was never shipped, and I was contacted via SMS regarding shipping payment, which I believe is not compliant with standard practices. Secondly, there's an issue with a €200 purchase that I made. Despite my bank confirming the payment, Amazon's system indicates that the payment was not received. This has caused significant inconvenience and I hope for a prompt resolution."
Very disappointed that Amazon has stopped supporting this app on tablets. The browser shopping experience on my tablet is not a good as the app provided. Amazon needs to re-evaluate this decision.
"""Lists"" new interface SUCKS! The old way when you click on the ""list"" tab was perfect, everything there and you just scroll through. Now they have something dumb where you have some lists in a horizontal scroll that don't show you the full title of the list, so you have no darn clue which one you're clicking and then under that, you have a list of ALL your items combined from all lists. Why?? I made a list for a reason, to separate them! They tried this before and it sucked then, sucks now."
"Don't buy!!!! I'm 99.9% sure that this third party private seller is having these rebuilt or buying them with the forknowledge of and with non Microsoft certified hardware,which is not at all difficult to do. They will of course deny this. I am very familiar with hardware and the Xbox console. Even the interface is different and it lags doing the most simple of menu tasks . Not to mention the loading icons and colors are all slightly different to the trained eye. Amazon is USA,s ALIBABA."
"MY 5 STARS JUST TOOK A NOSE DIVE TO ZERO! For many, MANY, moons, I've had a nearly perfect experience with Amazon shopping. A few days ago, the app said the ""tablet version"" is no longer available. I have an old af Note 10+. It's not a tablet at all. My OS works perfectly as do other various apps. I've scoured the world wide web for resolutions. I've tried every single one of them to no avail. The web version is even slower than the app version and much more tedious to use. BUMM.ER.DOOD!"
"The app was fine until the most recent update. The search bar is at the bottom and it gets in the way. Another annoying thing is how the cart option does not take you directly to your cart like it used to. If you navigate anywhere else from your ""cart"" then you have to keep pressing the ""cart"" option until it takes you back and you can check out. Yes i know...first world problems but it's an annoying shopping experience for me ."
"Very good experience with all the features and navigations. the only thing needs to be improved is filters. the all does not allow to select multiple filters at one time. the moment user selects one filter, the filter closes and search starts. because of which user has to go to filters multiple times to add multiple filters. A suggestion to improve filters."
"New user interface is appalling, there are article type things for recommended products that you have to scroll past, you have to choose and apply filters one at a time, you have to go through pages.. the once super easy, streamline app is now a hassle to use for shopping or even browsing products. They seem more focused on putting everything in your face other than what you're really shopping for.This app has really gone downhill with the last couple updates. Change it back, make it good again."
"It's just like the website, minus the speed, features, usability and convenience. I don't understand why this even exists. Want to zoom a user photo? That's too damn bad. Want 1 product page open while you look at a 2nd? Sucks to be you. Rather just use the web page again, or use it to view a 2nd product you're considering? Nope! This app will hijack your web browser and force you to use the crippled interface. Want to view product pics? No. None load for some items. Then the app locks up."
"1 star until search bar is fixed. I hate to do it, because I have always loved the Amazon app. However, moving the search bar to the bottom (with no opton to change it) has immediately and significantly ruined my experience. It's counterintuitive to all other search methods in all applications. No other app works in that way. I hate to be THIS negative... But the entire idea seems pointless to me. Change without progress. Back to 5 stars once my search bar is back at the top. Thanks."
"Older version was better. New layout with menu at the bottom is in the way, too easy to launch something in error, especially if you have big big fingers. Also, as you scroll down to view items...loss of screen space. Even older APK version, it changes the interface within, better off of using the web. Changing stuff just to change, why? Keep the main menu a the top or make it an option within the App allowing us to choose! Giving options is a better customer experience!"
"TERRIBLE utter dumpster fire of an app and a company. My only advice is to go to a dang store. It's cheaper, more convenient, and just over all an easier and better experience. The app is constantly freezing, the prices are jacked up way to high, and the delivery fees are crazy. A $2 toy will have an $8 fee just to get it by NEXT WEEK or later. Once, it took nearly a month for a $5 stylus to come.Customer service: inconvenient. For some reason, when I look up $10 crocs, I get $100 shoes! CRAZY!"
Put the search bar back at the top!! That's number one! The whole experience lately seems to be a nightmare! Between paying the ridiculous price for Prime and orders not arriving on time or if at all and vendors advertising they have an item and then they don't is just plain ridiculous! Things are not easy anymore and Amazon just doesn't seem to care. My experiences wirh them lately leave much to be desired! Shape up Amazon!
"Having my identity stolen once, while trying to place an order from Amazon. So I bought a prepaid $500 debit card, so I could order more, without taking a chance of the same experience of having to close all of my bank accounts, and starting all over,!! When I tried again to place more orders....I find out that: I CANNOT use it!!! You HAVE to use ""Pay Pal""...and they don't accept pre paid debit cards!!! (WHAT A CROCK!!)"
"This new app format/structure is UGLY. Huge, bubbly shaped interface. The icons/tap options eat TOO much space, taking up 1/10 the screen sometimes. I miss the old format. I'm sure they are trying to streamline the navigations but yikes! This is WAY too simplistic and its even uninteresting to use. Like going from using from M.S. Word to M.S. Notepad. PLEASE put it back to how it used to be: the navigation bar on the top left with options v.s. the options at the bottom with bubble shape options."
"I expected better Amazon! Fire your incompetent app programmers. These updates make the mobile experience on my LG V20 unbearable. And before you say it's my phone, all my other plethora of apps do not exhibit the behavior this app does. Slow and clunky, and becomes unresponsive at times. Lucky for me I have an app that keeps old backups of updated apps. I had to revert back to the Amazon app from January 2019 and it is running so much better!"
"Products are quality goods and materials. Timely shipping and free depending on item(s), or if order(s) are in excess of a certain amount. Navigating through the app is a little frustrating, for me, as I seem to get bumped from one item to the next and I end up lost in Amazon cyber-space. (That's probably a personal problem; my millennials - children, tell me I'm ""tech-tarded""!) Otherwise, GREAT SHOPPING EXPERIENCE!🤓"
"Their user interface is clunky, ugly and ineffective for searching for exactly what you want. You cannot interact with sellers directly. Listings give almost no info about the specific item you're buying, and their are almost never photos of the actual item you're buying, only stock photos. These problems are most apparent when buying used items. So many better outlets including ebay and etsy or direct from websites. The ONLY thing they are good for is user reviews. I'll never buy there again."
"App works quite well, and I find the service is VERY good. It seems like the selection has been getting a little thin lately. Will never replace shopping in-store. Still, a very easy and enjoyable online shopping experience. One pet peeve: I HATE the new icon! I get that brown resembles a plainly-wrapped parcel, but it's ugly and fails to catch my eye in the jumble of other icons. What was wrong with Amazon Blue? Oh, and stop making paid shipping the default when free has been earned!"
"[For reasons unknown, my review from last night has disappeared. I am sorely tempted to drop my prior rating from a 2 to a 1 on that alone.] The app functions and the UI is OK, but the search filters are terribly lacking compared to the desktop website. There are much fewer on the mobile app and you can only check and uncheck one at a time. Add the padding from all the sponsored listings, and this can make for a frustrating browsing experience."
"3 steps back. Loss continuous scrolling, now opens a new screen for filters, after selecting anything it immediately searches which annoying when you are trying add several items to filter, . and a overall dated interface. It is so bad removed the app. As it works exactly the same in a browser. Please go back the previous version much better when searching."
"Used to be a great app, easy to navigate and find what you are looking for quickly. The update was terrible making it take way longer to scroll through item lists and you constantly have to go through new pages (like when setting filters) instead of just clicking a button like the previous version. Honestly, not a good shopping experience and I havent been purchasing nearly as much as before."
"Made me Uninstall it due to the constant re-download of songs,Ads all the time when driving. Unsafe and having to organize the music in Playlist over and over. Plus there is no way to delete multiple songs at once from a Playlist or album from what I experienced. Select, delete, repeat. Bad reception areas r reason for download songs. But have to re-download so often. Ended up deleting app and canceling subscription."
"I don't experience a lot of crashing, but I do experience freezing and extended loading times (upwards of 30 seconds) pretty regularly. I'd like to be able to customize my home feed, because I am ZERO PERCENT interested in most of that content. Especially livestreams, which is a laughable concept to me. It's messy, cluttered and becoming a backwards app."
"I often use this for browsing on Amazon, but I don't like how little detail is visible before I click on something. I often click on items just to see what they are, since all I can see is a picture, so I end up with a lot of unnecessary recommendations relating to items that I only read the titles for. Another problem with the app is how it is slow and unresponsive when I try to scroll, especially compared to Internet browsers. While I enjoy the service, the app doesn't improve my experience."
"Honestly, Amazon has become disappointing. Speaking to the quality of the company, I've had more and more concerns with their business practices in recent years. As far as the app experience goes, I've been finding it difficult to use. The app is basically a web wrapper for the most part. It's not well integrated with newer features of Android, and it can be incredibly slow at times. I would have expected better from such a large, high value company."
"Can't switch no more, between US and Canada, after a last update of the application!!! It was a breeze to switch between, in a previous version. I am not an easy to confuse user and I have wasted few minutes looking for the darn switch option, still had not found! Just how evil SW guys can be to just change interface for millions of users, just like that; completely silly, irresponsible, evil and vicious!!!!!"
Latest update made shopping very difficult to navigate through the filters. The user interface visually looks like an improvement but is not user-friendly at all. Searches used to be all in one drop down menu (on Android) and you could make multiple selections a time. Now I can only make one filter selection at a time then I'm taken back to the narrowed choices to have to go and filter again. Overall shopping searches seem slower as well. Not impressed. Was a great app before update.
"This new ""Amazon Shopping"" experience app is a tad glitchy. While I can understand Amazon's efforts to update the app with a cleaner design, conceivably I feel it makes my search results that much more convoluted and difficult to sort through. The wish list functionality is atrocious. The old app made it easy to rename and manage the lists. It takes too long to load (and my phone is newer and speedy with everything else). If we can bring back some of the old functionality, that'd be great."
"Lots of bugs in this app. If you search in pantry once, it's very difficult to get back to a normal search. Also, the previous and next button are too wide for the page, so to click to the next page, I have to scroll over to the right! Why is an app not responsive design? Even the search results do this if you choose too many filters. What a bad user experience. And the worst thing of all is many items have completely different sets of reviews for an entirely different product. FIX YOUR APP!!"
"I've been an Amazon customer for at least 10 years now. I rarely have issues with the app but now I can't find the wish list tray. Has it been removed? This to me, was the best part of the app experience as it made it easy to add items to your list as you browse, especially when recommendations or ""customers also viewed/bought"" pops up and you want to add all those items to your list as well. Please bring back the list tray!!! It's efficient!"
This app is a chore to use. It's tedious to find anything unless you specifically search for it. It forces unrelated sponsored products in the results further adding to the frustration. It also keeps recommending I sign up for prime even though I already have it... Simple tasks drag out due to a confusing unintuitive interface. I'm really surprised at how bad it is.
"The app works okay for now. However, based on the experience with Amazon removing functionality and charging extra for it (like they did with Photos, and now in Nov 2022 with Music). Simple things like playing a specific song now cost extra, it will only play songs ""similar"" to for the fee we already pay. Expect bad decisions like this to come to the Amazon shopping app."
"What happens to ""see more""? If Amazon is looking for me to spend less time browsing, then the latest update is great! The new interface got rid of the ""see more"" option for most suggestions. Leaving me to search myself or only look at four that may or may not actually meet my needs.... Go back to the previous interface, it worked better and was more engaging."
"I shop on Amazon a lot. But this last app update is a disaster. I don't really like the new interface, but I know I'll adjust. The main issue is glitchy things. I can't scroll through my wishlist anymore. It's stuttering and won't actually scroll down. The whole app in general is so slow to load now and going between sections of the app is a mess."
"I usually don' leave reviews but this new Amazon app is horrible. It crashes and also goes to a blank white screen when trying to view an item. This is very frustrating when you've gone through 50 items out of 800 and it crashes!! The older version had its glitches, but it wasn't nearly as bad as this new one. I've been trying to use now it for about 30 minutes and it's glitched in 1 form or another at least 6-7 times. I stopped my usually enjoyable shopping experience just to leave this review"
"The NEW LAYOUT in this app just made my shopping experience more difficult and cumbersome. Is that what you want Amazon? ... for people to stop using this app? Well, it worked. I don't like the changes you just made to the user interface. Those four buttons at the bottom of the screen are too close to the Android controls for my phone and I keep tapping the wrong ones. The cart belongs in the top right corner like everyone else does it, not at the bottom. CHANGE IT BACK TO THE WAY IT WAS!"
"New interface and navigation is awful. You search for a specific item and get everything but. Product names are cut off so if you are looking at several products from a company you can only go off of the picture. Filters don't seem to work, especially the price filter? When searching for something specific, like office heels for women, I kept getting slippers and tennis shoes? Way too clunky to navigate now. I've been with Amazon for awhile and wish they would go back to the old app interface."
"Not a fan of the new update for one. But especially, lately, the service quality has gone way down. I have had a few instances of packages not showing up at all. I left a review in one such instance. It wasn't rude just honest about my experience and Amazon wouldn't allow it. Disappointing. I should be supporting smaller businesses more anyway."
"Searching and filtering is so hard. The app changes over time. The most recent change is to the filtering, and it's driving me nuts. You can't choose multiple filtering criteria without navigating through all the sub categories and waitng for the page to reload after every selection. Search results have always been designed to benefit sellers, and somehow the crappiest ones. It's getting worse. Amazon knows it's a fixture and that we won't jump ship, so their concern for our experience is gone."
"Amazon is okay but searching is the absolute worst in the industry. You cannot get amazon to allow you to filter anything. It was also, just now, selecting departments I did not want it to select, thus limiting my results to a smaller area. Like they do this on purpose. It will not actually sort by price, brand, or rating. You get results that all mixed up. This makes for a very bad shopping experience. I have to research outside Amazon then get what I want for a product. I wish they would fix"
"Lots of features missing. Cannot sort Saved for Later. List interface is slow and clunky and lacks features. Email and interaction with vendors is atrocious and almost useless. Layout is dorky and wastes functionality and space, does not display what you need it to, where you need it to. Too much advertising for other products. General search for products is difficult. Not many search tools allowed. Truly second rate programming. Billions of dollars, and this is the best they can do?"
"It is kind of hard to believe that Amazon would produce an app this bad.  It is actually one of the worst I've ever tried-- especially when compared  with the Amazon website.  I couldn't find a way to navigate.   There is a menu to go back to the home page, so you can have the pleasure of redoing your search from scratch.  Seriously? No back button?  If there is a way to navigate it is hidden really well.  The sorting features are mostly missing.  I couldn't find a way to filter by size, department, manufacturer, and etc.  As we all know there are a LOT of products on Amazon, so lack of sorting makes for a painful shopping experience-- takes forever to find stuff.  I definitely won't be shopping with this app.  I immediately deleted it from my phone-- it's a total waste of storage space."
"The shopping experience on Amazon continues to deteriorate. Amazon is trying too aggressively to tell my preferences, so it just won't show all that is available. Plus the same item comes up over and over from different sellers. Additionally half of all *l""results"" are sponsored ads. I am no longer shopping around in the app or on the site. It's a frustrating waste of time to find what you are looking for. Plus there are endless products that don't match images or descriptions. Amazon is dying."
"A step down from the Underground version. The filter options are not as uniform nor are the results always what you searched. And then 20 results are all you get until you go to the next page. It's odd, I thought for sure that the app that we are all being forced to use now would have a more user friendly interface like the one that was recently discontinued. Maybe it's a way to keep us on the same version, I get that, but maybe update it with better features?"
"I miss the old version of the app. I loved the drag and drop feature for the items being put into a list at the bottom.. The search bar, I noticed, sucks too. The update overall, isn't it sis. My shopping on Amazon has decreased alot since.. I primarily use the app since it's easier, but the update for the Amazon app really changes the experience in a negative way.."
"The app is definitely a bit clunkier, but searching items is such a bad experience, there's a lean into a ""minimalistic"" approach where you don't see full item names, the Free Delivery option etc. And it's just ugly. The worst part is your search results look normal until you click for the next page, then it changes over to this ugly new interface. Blegh. At least give me an option to change it back."
"When the app works, it's great. However, the vast majority of the time, whenever I try to search for something on the app it will initially load the page, but seconds later will load the picture of a dog with the words, ""uh-oh, looks like something went wrong."" I have this experience both on WiFi and 4G connections. I would recommend just using their website instead. Don't waste your time trying to get the app to work."
"Horrible experience with Amazon and their third-party vendors. Multiple packages either never arrived or arrived with missing or damaged pieces. Customer service was slow and the app made it nearly impossible to communicate and resolve the issue. Won't be using this app, Amazon Prime or Amazon again. To make matter worse, they have blocked any attempts at me posting a review on their site. For faulty products that had only 5 star reviews. Buyer beware."
"Don't know what has been done to this app- it is very unreliable. It is extremely slow and unresponsive when trying to click on reviews or selecting an item to place in cart. I've tried stopping, clearing cache, uninstalling, etc. and no change to the experience except it seems to be getting worse. It is definitely the app because I am able to go on the website on the same device and browse and order without any problem. Please make the app functional again. Thx."
"The Amazon app is complete and utter failure. It has been updated into a slow, laggy, clunky, unusable app. Instead of making your shopping experience streamlined and pleasant, it frustrates you with sponsored ads and continues freezes when you try to delete an item from your private list. Moreover, when you search for something, instead of providing you with one long continues item list, it now breaks it up into pages that require you to click a next button. Can't even use a VPN with this app."
"Malware that really shouldn't be an ""Editor's Choice"" unless that title was bought. The app itself is painfully slow, it's clunky to navigate, and crashes to the point of having to restart the device it's installed on. It attempts to hijack device settings (like location) during the restart process as well, and outright shuts down other app notifications while it's running. An unpleasant, stressful, and customer hostile user experience. Would avoid, but can't."
"Moving the search bar to the bottom was the stupidest most pointless thing I've ever seen. Other apps I have literally pop up things towards the bottom because they are expecting the interface to be at the top like most apps do. It's horrible and I'm going to uninstall the app and refuse to use it until it's either given an option to move it or it's just put back at the top. Yes, I hate it that much. It's very annoying and was a pointless change."
"Once again congratulations to the app developers that have ruined something that used to work. The new app update has ruined the interface and made it awkward, clunky and even easier to freeze. I used to love the Amazon app because it was seamless and offered an effortless transition between the pages. Now, impossible to find which links will take you where you want, constant freezing and of course, the inability to go back to your account screen after a search because the toolbar disappears."
"My experience with Amazon was great at first, 5 stars and all. Always got my stuff and on-time. And if there was an issue they were quick to fix it. Now it seems i can't order a single thing without problems. Im getting damaged items, even tho the delivery box is fine. Items get delayed and keep delaying. Buying new but getting refurbished, even tho i payed new price. And when you call its just a hassle, with all the run-a-rounds, and just everything about them is getting worse and worse."
"Amazon, listen to your customers! Something has happened to the mobile format and now search results are huge and require scrolling all around just to see (left, right, up, and down). Nothing fits on the page anymore. It's messy, inconvenient, and inefficient. The sort of thing that drives away business because customers have to work too hard just to find what they need, when other sites offer a better, more organized user experience. Take notes from these reviews and please fix this problem!"
"The lag is so bad it renders this app unusable. It doesn't matter how good it looks (it does), how good the interface is (very), or how intuitive it is to use (yup, top marks) if it takes 30 seconds to complete a simple task or lags horribly when trying to scroll. A missed opportunity."
"Please change the app back to the old interface. This new version is laggy, and a pain in the butt to navigate. Why change something that works? Users do not want to learn the new interface. As someone who shops almost exclusively on amazon 10s of thousands of dollar$ a year... I will be finding an alternative until the app is fixed. Bad choice Amazon!"
"Why is it that app programmers think they know better than the people who use their apps. This goes for Microsoft, Linux, and Unix based apps. People don't like switching gears every time they switch apps and have to relearn hand gestures and menus. The term keep it simple stupid is a great philosophy for that. Take it from an IT guy who supports Boeing engineers, they prefer simple and minimal changes to their interface so they don't have to relearn where everything is."
"Fine until my reviews got removed due to the algorithm. Everything in a purchase should be part of the experience, to include shipping offered for the purchase. If the item doesnt come in for three weeks after the expected delivery, others should be able to know that it could be a concern. Also, I cant see the reviews any longer, only the total star ratings and star ratings on certain aspects of items. I would like to use reviews to make better decisions on purchases, but cannot all around."
"Mininalsim has ruined the user interface. When one used to be able to get an overview over their orders and other things easily, the app now separates things in separate tabs, resulting in heavily reduced accessibility. Also the recommendations. Click on a product once; and now you get spammed with it for ever. Ordered something you only need once? You must be a huge fan, buy more of it. This wouldn't be a problem if editing your history or tuning your recommendations wasn't so convoluted."
"Terrible market place, half the reviews are fake, half the listings send different products to different people. The app interface isn't great for browsing. The options provided for search filters are pretty random, most of the time I can't filter by price. Amazon flat out lies about delivery date and availability of free delivery on the item listing. Even though the dates on the listings claim to be specific to my postcode, when I go to pay, the options are always different. Waste of time."
"I like shopping with Amazon, but I do get tired of them messing with the interface all the time. A recent change I absolutely hate is the addition of an ad bar at the top of the app that reloads every single time I click on anything and I have to wait until the ad fully loads before I can even use the page. It's not as though every page doesn't already have a dozen featured product ads. Why do I need more ads for other products slowing down my use of the entire app? Whose idea was that?"
"The updated app experience makes it more difficult to find products that were easy to find in the past, filtering is more difficult, and the overall experience is just worse. When this was simply a front end to their website, it was easy to find the things I wanted and search categories with ease, but now some categories don't show up at all versus the website, and others are bare ones. Overall this is another step in the wrong direction for Amazon."
"This used to be a really good app but the new user interface is terrible. As a developer myself I recognise it's important to think about UX, and this app doesn't do that at all. Navigating to specific categories is really confusing and generally very slow. I'd like to see the original flyout menu system come back which was much easier to use. Also, I wasn't able to find a way to disable the autoplaying Prime Video advert on the home screen? Very annoying and distracting."
"The amount of content in terms of videos and ads is high. It used to be relatively fast. Shopping was an easy experience. Over the years, it's become bloated, and much less convenient. In terms of usability, finding account options ranges from easy to ridiculously difficult. There's a sea of menus, with what seems like hundreds of options buried in them. It would be a huge improvement if Amazon were to simplify and streamlined account options."
"Autoplay ads in search results are infuriating! Amazon, I want to see the product, not some stupid ""influencers"" idea of what will cause me to buy a product. This just slows everything down. Good news for me, I guess, since I seen two be spending less money on Amazon. This is just a bad user experience and there is no way to turn it off."
I have yet to had a great experience with amazon. Almost every order has had something gone wrong with it and I've had way to many technical issues to my liking. Can't even use my cart anymore as the site doesn't let me past shipping. The customer support are very slow and most of the time seem like they don't read what you're typing and miss the issue. Only after long conversations is the issue delt with (If at all) My friends have a good experiences with amazon but I can't say the same.
"I kinda hate this app. It's a severely downgraded experience from using the website. You can't easily manage lists, you can't search for other people's lists, you can't manage your subscribe and save. The app doesn't launch when you click an Amazon link someone sends you. It's basically only for for buying things that you're actively searching for and nothing else."
"No longer allowed to see what products other people have reviewed. The interface is confusing, just lists of functions. Sponsored products crowd out relevant ones. Fast delivery times are promised and then switched once you order. Lower prices are shown for items in the search, but then true higher prices shown once you click an item. And thanks to their fantastic advertising, every ""article"" I open on Google is just a descriptive advertisement. Trash app, trash company."
"Not a fan of yhe most recent update, the tracking map is always up which is fine but the information overlaps it so you can't fully see the entire map only about the top half, you can't adjust it to see the full map, it's annoying. Now today the app isn't working at all. They shouldn't make major changes until they are sure it works and makes the experience better!"
WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER EXERIENCED!!!! I am so disappointed and frustrated with the experience I had when I needed a replacement order I have canceled my membership and will no longer use Amazon at all. I was a very active and loyal customer for two years and depended on them to help make my new life as a single mom easier. It really did until I had a problem with an order. Horrible communication problem in their customer service department. Online and on the phone
"Haven't used this app in about a year, but I decided to order something since I couldn't find it elsewhere. What a horrible mistake. The user interface and tracking in this app leave much to be desired, not to mention the package is currently a week late, and amazon seems unsure if it will arrive at all. I do my online shopping on eBay whenever possible, and this experience has heavily solidified that stance."
This app was previously functional on all of my Android devices. One of the updates is rendered this app completely unusable on every device I have. The app claims there's no internet connection when I've tried on multiple different methods. There are no useful support threads and Amazon just says to reinstall the app from the play store. An unfortunate experience when the website runs perfectly fine in mobile on all of the same devices.
"Great app! The interface is easy to use, items are good quality and shipping is amazing compared to other apps. I ordered some manga, it was my first order on Amazon and was expected 3 days after the day i ordered it. It came the next day in perfect condition and that was without amazon prime. Every other book i ordered since has came the very next day with most other items coming in a month (worst case scenario) or the next day (best case scenario). Definitely stick with amazon."
"The new changes are awful and seriously hurt my shopping experience. I only can see one product at a time on screen when scrolling?? I need to be able to quickly scroll and compare and this has made the process significantly more difficult. Also, the search bar needs to be at the top! I understand it makes a thumbs only experience better but there is already wasted screen space at the top with notification bars, it makes sense to combine everything together. Please, return to the old app design."
"I have an Amazon warehouse nearby and can see exactly where the Amazon truck carrying my package is at the moment and how many stops it has left until it gets to me. Not applicable to everybody, but the app handles this feature really well. Also, in my experience, the app is actually a bit easier to navigate in some ways than the website. At least, the basic design is more intuitive. Also, as a general rating for the Amazon service, I'd also give 5 stars. It's easy to shop confidently."
"Can we get rid of the Alexa button in the lower right hand corner. The placing is terribly inconvenient as most people are right handed and tend to hit it will trying to scroll. At least give me the option to turn it off. Also the revised menu set ups aren't great and the app seems buggy now. Please stop trying to fix what isn't broken, it just makes the experience worse."
"The app used to be lightspeeed fast... After a year of interface redesigns and updates, it's probably one of the most sluggish apps I've ever seen out there. Full size photos in product reviews take forever to load... After few failed attempts, I don't even try clicking on video reviews anymore -- I simply don't have 5 extra minutes to wait for each 30 sec video to load🤷🏻‍♂️ It keep crashing constantly, clicking on product links shows ""oops, something went wrong puppy"" in like 50% cases.."
"The new filter screen is worthless and spoils the user experience. I have to press back key couple of time during navigation between search result and filter screen. Moreover now a days many mobile don't have navigation keys, user experience on such mobile has become cumbersome. Unless old filter menu comes back I am not buying anything on Amazon."
"First, I have absolutely horrible experiences with Amazon music (canceling after my trial runs out). Now, I can't even shop on the Amazon app without it constantly crashing. I pay for prime. Why? I can't even purchase any of my own needs nor gifts for Christmas. They're losing money and are going to lose even more when people start canceling prime. I know I'm going to if this issue isn't resolved before my next month's renewal."
"My family greatly appreciates shopping on Amazon due to its convenience, user-friendly interface, refund policy, and high-quality, durable products."
"I used to like Amazon. I don't think the work is a doing a job. Somebody cheat me out of my money. Just a few days ago, deliver my package. Send a picture and took my package back. I'm having a worst experience ever."
"Unintuitive menus and recently increasingly very, very slow. You can it watch going to the cloud for even simple interface tasks, it's like watching paint dry. The basic interface really should be constructed locally, or they should throw more resources at their cloud solution. To add insult to injury, the option to change region / language in the Settings recently disappeared. No progress to a remedy after half a dozen calls to customer service..."
"The least intuitive UI experience in the history of front ends. Good luck going straight to where you want if you need to view your payment methods, messages, recent cs chats, etc. Numerous vague menus leading to even more vague submenues. Also, stupid in-search ads autoplay making the app crash on my phone. I don't need demos of other products when I'm literally in the middle of searching for something specific that I'm in need of.. much less when it has a 99% chance of crashing the app!"
"Painfully slow and laggy. Search is slow, the whole experience is a mess. Much faster to use my web browser than the app."
Bad app. Keep crashing. Bad interface. Different to use it
Moved the search bar in an attempt to get you to buy more stuff. They think that it improves the one handed experience but it leaves your hand further away from the auto complete suggestions which is more inconvenient. I'd much rather the option to move the search bar than be forced to have it at the bottom when every other app and site has it at the top. It's not original or unique. It's solely an inconvenient especially when the browser keeps it at the top. It's not a feature but a drawback.
"Horrible. This update ruined a great app. It is now useless for casual shopping. I usually buy random things when I see them on sale, well now all those sales are gone. No more 'hey this green one is on sale, I'll get that, instead of looking for the teal one of another brand.' I don't have the time, nor the want, to click on every option for an item to see the price for each one. It is completely useless. Please go back to the old interface."
The new interface sucks. The drop-down menu is useless. I can't navigate to what I'm looking for. As soon as you hit one option you're taken back to all the articles. I want to be able to click more options like in the old app. Also just 20 articles per page and then you have to click 'Next Page' is irritating. It used to be that you could scroll down indefinitely. I noticed that I close the app sooner than I used to and start shopping elsewhere. 3 months later and it's even worse now.
"Terrible since the last update. The interface now has fixed controls at the top and bottom of the screen instead of a menu that can be hidden when not in use, the app is has many glitches now and I have to exit and reopen just for it to refresh my orders and basket. I no longer get delivery notifications, so I have to hope the parcel is delivered on the intended day rather than having confirmation. The driver location now doesn't update until after the estimated delivery window closes."
"This app seems to have some issues with user interface and touch sensitivity. When scrolling it'll randomly decide that I wanted to click on something instead of scrolling. Navigating the search filters is difficult since the back button goes to the previous page instead of going back to the search filter list. Fairly good app, but it has some UX issues."
"Usually the app works fine, not as detailed as the website but great for quick purchases and browsing for your wishlist. But a week ago the thing just crashed and it wouldnt reopen. I reset my phone cleared out the app cache and all but it just wouldnt work. I'm reinstalling it now but that experience was a real let-down in terms of the app's quality. Other than that, it bugged out of payment in checkout a couple of times, but works well overall."
"UI is constantly changing, leading to a disjointed experience with the app. ""Orders"" page is constantly buggy, often not loading. Several times I have had delivery personel deliver packages by throwing it at my door... never enough packaging in the boxes, and sometimes the thin paper tape is torn or not put on properly to seal the box. Returns are confusing, and they make you drive to a Whole Foods or a participating UPS store to make a return when they screw something up... highly frustrating."
"Love Amazon! I've ordered from them so many times I cant even count. Only had 2 lost packages in the years I've been using them, which is fine, mistakes happen. They always told me right away when their was an issue with the delivery so I wasnt waiting around. They always went above and beyond my expectations making the situation right. Amazing customer service, crazy fast delivery, great prices, and very user friendly website/app interface. 5 Stars!"
"Great experience, a lot of choices from different prices, easy to return if not suitable, always have good deals, prices are close to Temu but much faster delivery time than Temu."
"New update sucks. Amazon was fine before this update. Not only was I spending daily , I was so happy with Amazon prime. Being able to access on my mobile app. Now it keeps saying I need to enter my info then it says it's sending a notification and doesn't even connect. I'm not sure if you are hacking me or what. I'm done with Amazon for now. Send me an email when you go back to the old interface."
"Amazon Engineers ruined the app. The app worked fine before, the UI was fluent and it was fast. I am using a Note 20 Ultra, the new recent update has turned the app into a cumbersome clunky experience with major latency issues. I've spent over 21 grand this year via Amazon and I'll be using another service until this is fixed. It's too aggravating! Stop trying to fix what isn't broken. Is each engineer trying to impress their boss with each new update? The old version was perfect!"
The sorting filter searching price from low to high SUCKS! It doesn't work most of the time and when it does you get your results stripped down to just a few results! Its eliminating results rather than just sorting price from low to high!ALSO it's very irritating because you constantly have to re-do your search filter/preference! There is no way to lock your search preference that I can find. Makes for an awfully overall experience. Considering uninstalling it and just using the website only.
"Filter settings don't work properly, they take ages to load. Can't set price range if you don't select the category first!!. And even after selecting the category, I can't customise the price range. Besides, if during an order I'm typing somewhere (e.g. text on the gift message), switching to another app (even for a millisec) wipes all the text. Apart from the left-hand menu, the whole interface needs redesigning. The wish list section is badly organized. Overall: definitely needs improvements."
Amazon changed the interface and I hate it. The shopping cart and menu is on the bottom now which is inconsistent from the website. This is already annoying because I use my laptop and my phone to purchase things. It is also frustrating because my fingers are moving up and down all the time now. I have to go down to press the shopping cart or menu and then I have to go back up to press the purchase button or the my orders button. I've deleted the app and I'm using the website on both device
"App has become the worst version of itself that I've ever experienced. Always crashing and lagging, product videos will go to black screen and never play. Cart button goes to a product and not cart. Lots of issues. I'm not going to write a book about them. My experience with Amazon Shopping has become labored and tedious. I sincerely hope they get things back to before the newest update."
"Normally, the app works fine, however I am unable to log into the app at the moment. Keep getting error message ""This specific device is not authenticated. Please try again. (10)"" I can log on fine in my browser so it's not an account problem. I use this app a lot and never experienced problems. Rang customer services and they wasn't much help. Couldn't rectify the problem and just told me to try again in 24hrs! 😠🙄"
"When I download the app, it works just fine on the web-like interface. Then, after a few hours it automatically reverts to an ""updated"" interface and stops working from there. Plus there is the obnoxious alexa that amazon keep trying to ram down my throat. Tired of uninstalling and reinstalling. My phone is new btw and has 5G. I'm reverting to using the online store version..."
Last update has completely ruined the easy to use interface and now forces sponsored items during your searches. Not as easy to use as it was. UPDATE 14/5/21. Now Amazon have taken away the option to search for items pre ordered. Very hard now to see what u have purchased and may need to change. Another reason showing Amazon is not very customer friendly anymore
"Very easy to navigate, very smooth interface. I love Amazon! You find everything you're looking for and more. I am an Amazon Prime member so the 2 Day delivery is awesome, never really have a problem with them. The couples times I did have a problem was a package not showing up, and I was either refunded or sent another product, absolutely love the app, so much easier than logging onto the website all the time."
"New app is a goddamn disaster. Can't change country/language/region so I'm stuck in my neighbouring country in the app. Incredibly slow. New interface is very unintuitive. Something that looks like a menu tab button is actually a junk page filled with random categories. Something that looks like a user settings page is actually a facebook-like profile page. Who even uses that? Huge downgrade, almost unusable. I hope whoever thought this was a good idea got fired."
"Amazon starting their service here in the UAE was a godsend. It revitalised online shopping, for me at least. It's a good service, or it feels that way because all others are bad. Thankfully, haven't had a bad experience yet, but I imagine it's a matter of time. Wish their delivery system was a bit more flexible, and allows us to choose the time to receive it. Minus one star."
"Have been a loyal Amazon Prime member and frequent shopper for years. The service isn't at all what it used to be though. What happened to free 2 day shipping for Prime members? Now orders are being split up into individual items, each with their own shipping speed, and something that used to get here in 2 days without issue will now take a week. It's madness. It seems they want you to pay more more more and give you less less less. Honestly, at this point I am mostly using Walmart for everything I used to get through Amazon. Their prices and shipping are both consistent. Amazon can not beat out the competition anymore. Seems like they stopped caring about quality customer service over this past year. Not sure I will continue with Prime when it comes time to renew. Shopping Amazon isn't as fun and rewarding an experience as it used to be."
"Fix it or I'll stop talking to Alexa! No seriously, it used to be good but now it's all screwed up. Android and tablet versions are both an horrific experience and trying to shop or browse for items has never been so frustrating. Loading thumbnails or enlarging pics takes ages and once on a close up picture there's no way to go back, back button just doesn't do anything... Until it jumps all the way back to the hlme page. FIX IT! pretty please"
"Terrible Interface... This app continues to create frustration every time it's used. Laggy; any single action takes upwards of 20 seconds EVERY time. Freezes when it finally does perform your action. I have the most updated version, yet it seems worse than before, which is saying a lot. Just an awful app from start to finish."
Try to use my account and it's been blocked and not long got 6 months of prime thank you giving me a terrible experience with your service
I like the Amazon app. Easy to use and easy to order products and get them delivered fast by experienced delivery drivers. Thanks Amazon!
The best experience ever i have with online shopping products. When you buy something and get delivery even you don't like or change your mind it's totally free return and refund process is very very fast i experienced three four times Highly recommend
"New update sucks. I prefer to see it all on one page without having to scroll left and right to view everything. I have gone to setting to try and change it back, however no such option can be found. It has made my shopping experience much less pleasurable. *edit* I have now disabled because you can't fix anything. Thank you for ruining my shopping experience. I'll be using the web browser now instead of the app."
I can't believe how Amazon can get a simple thing such as clearly displaying the Logout button so wrong! I literally came on to leave this review after spending a few minutes trying to find the Logout button and I still can't find it. This happens every time I switch accounts and for the life of me I can never remember or find it again. What an incredible feat. Please sort this out and make it easier to get to as this is one painful experience.
"I have amazon prime and while that experience is great, the app has become pure garbage. I can't seem to enter the search bar without an annoying bug showing up where a double search bar appears that doesn't let me search anything. The only way to get rid of it is to close the app. It wouldn't be so bad if didnt happened every other time I open the app. EDIT: Why is it that when I try to click on cart, it takes me to the search results and refuses to take me to the cart??! So annoying"
"This app gets worse everyday. Randomly closes. No longer updates the deal alerts based on items I search, and doesn't allow us to manually add items. Receive out for delivery notifications when orders aren't actually out for delivery. The new delivery tracking map is almost completely covered by a big box with my address. Get it together Amazon. Prices go up and our service experience gets worse."
Absolute rubbish. The app keeps on crashing on my tablet after a few seconds. I will tell you what Jeff. I know you are finding it difficult to make ends meet what with the divorce and all that so I will lend you a few quid so that you can get a proper programmer to finish the app properly then you can pay me back when you are flush. I can't say fairer than that. 3rd August 2030. App has just updated. Still unusable. Constant crashes. Seamless shopping experience? I don't think so!
"My experience w/ Amazon has been a positive one until recently. My house & wardrobe could be used for promotional purposes. I'm constantly asked where did you get that? ""Amazon"" is 99% of the time my answer. My only concern is that lately items I purchased seem to have disappeared from my order history. Plus, when making a purchase they charge the total order. Then I get hit with individual item charges following that. It's as if I'm paying double for the items. Need 2 checking in with them &?"
most amazing experience i have ever had it's like the best thing ever like it's reading my mind almost beautiful technology ❣️❣️
Recent updates don't let you zoom out to view multiple products after a search. All the products are shown in extra large icons and fills the whole screen I have to constantly scroll side to side to view products. This is making my shopping experience tiresome. Please fix this app to be able to view smaller icons and fit to page without the need to scroll side to side just to view a product. This only happens when viewing search results.
"I've never really had any issues with ordering or returning through Amazon. I've also experienced good customer service. HOWEVER, lately I've had plenty of issues. One of my items never arrived and amazon had cancelled the order stating that there was an issue and a refund will be given. But I have yet to receive the refund after several phone calls. Furthermore, the only selections that I have for returns are at their amazon hub locations and it has caused nothing but issues with no refunds."
"Overall, very good experience. BUT, the Filter feature is VERY Annoying! Why does the app need to refresh with every single change to the filter criteria? Why can user be not given the option to choose MULTIPLE / ALL criteria at once, and then only the app refreshes? (for reference, you may check Flipkart app) Please fix this. A similar annoyance existed with the absence of instant 'add to Wish List' feature, especially with the search results. This was fixed with the Heart icon feature."
"Constant changes to the app layout for no apparent reason. A few weeks or maybe months back, everything was accessible from three bars, top right. Then that moved to the bottom left. Then, 'Your Orders' moves to another button accessed from a new icon. These constant changes are not improving the user experience. Soon, if you carry on, the interface will be as clunky and illogical as that of an xbox. Go back to thinking 'Customer First."
"I am an AVID Amazon Prime shopper. I peruse the app DAILY. The last few days, this task has been HORRIBLE! I can not get through a simple scroll without it freezing, jumping around, and being EXTREMEMLY slow to populate. I have rebooted my 2023 phone as well as uninstalled and re-installed the Amazon app. The experience is frustrating and, frankly, will aid in me keeping my money. This will not be good for you during the holidays. Amazon, the ball is in your court to resolve this."
"The new UI offers a poorer user experience, it clogs up the bottom of the screen as you cannot close it, like you could with the sidebar. It now splits everything the side bar did into extra tabs, not useful! This takes up more time. Bottom bars are not good for me as it requires me to completely reposition my thumb to access it, once again wasting time and reducing my user experience."
"Not used Amazon for a while, but the experience seems just as good as it was previously."
"This used to be a great app. No longer customer friendly. Amazon has turned an amazing functional shopping experience into a disaster. The glitz uses storage space makes the user wait and no longer functions well. In addition, Amazon's Prime shipping no longer works as it use to. Despite ordering early and receiving notice of delivery date that came and went. The purchase then just dropped off my app. Get back to function The overall experience means amazon is no longer my go to shopping app!!!"
"Great until they changed the icon. The app worked well until they thought it was aesthetically pleasing to put a brown turd on my home screen. I had to switch to Nova launcher to change it. Go back to the old icon Amazon. update: the new user interface is awful and replaced a perfectly good system. whoever is in charge of changing user interface lately needs to go on vacation, they've gone crazy under lockdown."
"Constantly changing with poor user interface. Seems to be harder to use each week with all the updates, not to mention Amazon removing (re:censoring) what I want to buy from my wishlist. I also keep getting an issue where I try to scroll on my wishlist but it rubber bands back up again. Not to also mention it's poor search keyword functionality and slow performance."
"Amazon prime was the worst subscription ever. I pretty much paid $13 a month to ensure I had the best possible customer service I could get shopping online. Well everything is great normally, but wait until you actually have an issue. The worst customer service I have ever experienced. Not only did they not help me, but waisted 2 hours of time I should have spent enjoying with my family, oh an they had the nerve to try and sell me something for 25% off on the way out. Canceled my subscription!"
"Worst app ever! Refreshes after each selection so you have to go back every time you want to add a condition, Amazon expects you to have the sorting options committed to memory since hitting the back button goes back to the search page, have to press the next button to see the next batch of products instead of seamless scrolling. Worst user experience in all the shopping apps I've used."
"Edit. It seems recent notifications has also been removed. New update has made the app more unusable. The new menu from the bottom is made with large font, features less options, and is unwieldy. The removal of open orders makes the whole order filter pointless and unusable. It is 1 step forward and about 100 steps back in terms of user experience"
"It was a great experience at first but since November or so I have been charged twice a month for prime membership, I guess they charge you double for the ""free shipping"" I have been attempting to contact customer service in the app, which the app lags alot and it will automatically take me back to the home page. It has improved slightly more and is doing less than that. But I'm not sure if you are supposed to be charged twice each month for Amazon prime."
"Love the app, hate the new icon. Shopping on the app is as fluid as you'd expect with a desktop experience. The latest app icon is the reason I had to give 4 stars instead of 5. I used to be able to locate it so easily. Even though the app is in the same spot all the time, a non-descript image keeps blocking my muscle memory (it just doesn't stand out compared to my other shopping apps). I would love to see the old icon return or something more like it."
"Amazon is amazing and never fails to deliver! I have had nothing but good experiences when ordering through amazon. Sometimes it doesn't have the BEST deals for specific products (rarely), but they always deliver days before the estimated arrival date! Unless, it's a pre-ordered package of some sort! I am forever pleased with their services."
"The latest update puts advertisements that play for several seconds when opening the app for stupid Amazon shows I will never watch. Then, I can't open my shopping cart... every time I try to go to my cart to check out, it goes to my previous search results page instead. I'm so frustrated with the app experience because it just shows how Amazon is behaving as a business, faulty app updates that ruin customer experience just for the sake of ad revenue. I might cancel my entire Prime subscription."
"Edit: Terrible shopping experience. Been over a year of packages not being delivered or being over a week late. Not only me, but several of my friends and family have been dealing with this and decided to cancel all our amazon accounts including all of our primes, due to the poor customer service, not getting our packages, and deceitful advertising. It has been over a year this and it's not worth paying for a service that dosent do what they strive to do. Much easier to go to Walmart."
"I have experience with Amazon India & Canada. The switching experience is not fluid. Amazon India has COD option, which is great & I do not have to provide my Credit Card. Amazon Canada has no such option. When crossing borders, I have to switch to the country I am in. Shipping is also complicated and may be more expensive than the product. Search filters are very limited. Amazon Canada enforces control over customer reviews & will not show reviews, even though no foul language used."
7/3/23: after no response on the new aggravating layout and the option to move search bar back to the top. I have decided the amazon app is now to aggravating to easily shop from. I have switched to Walmart and home depot. They now have a more pleasant shopping experience. Which is weird to me because that used to be Amazon's whole thing. I have Uninstalled the app and my prime subscription will expire at the end of the current bill.
"Had been avoiding the new update after reading lots of negative reviews about the new interface. The options to switch Amazon country disappeared so I was forced to do so. Don't appreciate the breaking change. Also, as other users have reported, the app doesn't take account the space required for the keyboard tray. The keyboard overlays the input fields when opened - e.g. when giving a list a name - so the user cannot see what they are typing. Very poor."
"Edit 12/26/2021: This app is a bit better, but still lacks big-time. It's hugely inconvenient that I cannot search review keywords in the Amazon app but can on their website. Bumping from two to three stars based on improvements. Original review: This app feels very outdated. It's slow and laggy, buttons (like share item) are really tricky to find. Overall an embarrassingly bad experience from a company as large as Amazon."
"Scammy click-bait changes Recently the search results started showing a product with a price that was the lowest in the listing. I.E. the listing in the search results will be for ""100 pieces"", but the price shown will be for ""5 pieces"". You can't see this without clicking the listing, thus wasting a ton of time due to mis-information. This experience is awful, and discourages continued use of the Amazon marketplace. I'd rather go somewhere that doesn't lie to me in their search results."
"This is not the app I expect from a billion dollar company. The search engine is broken and insists on providing unrelated, irrelevant, or advertising results. Amazon doesn't play well with VPNs. Had to split tunnel Protonmail Plus servers. Still had crashes. Even then, it's a terrible experience. I hope you like dogs; you'll be looking at them frequently when the app crashes. ""Uh-oh Something went wrong on our end"". I see that more than I see anything else. Terrible app."
"Worse shopping experience.since the last update. No log out option, the app immediately opens without asking for a password, if your phone is stolen anyone can go on a shopping spread with your card. Amazon made it impossible to change your default account and they've hidden all settings that you need to manage your profile. It uses a webpage interface, slow, unresponsive and sincerely a lazy way of providing a shopping app."
"As per other reviews - lately the app isn't running smoothly - takes an age to load a page or won't at all - also when clicking on different items the page doesn't load - just not smooth or fast enough and makes it a very frustrating experience, especially when I'm paying monthly for the service. I think the whole app needs a modern retake/refresh on it. (P.S - Please change the logo, or give a choice of different styles - really don't like this one 😔)"
Was once the place to go now it's the place I'm not ever coming back to. The pc is more reliable then amazon app. Even the prime video for the phone is laggy and degraded sound. This site used to be fast and easy to use. Now the loading and scrolling is messed up it takes way to long to load pages. Too much lag too much unsecured 3rd party experiences. No thank you. Also the app drains my battery tremendously my phone over heats every time I use it. Terrible
"I believe Amazon has given me the best experience of any other shopping app or store for that matter. However, I did receive a opened case of Reese's cups that are far out of date and I don't like that. What can they do about that?"
"I am a long time customer and primarily have done my shopping via the app. Like several reviewers, the past update has caused it to be annoying and frustrating. First of all, what's with the ads replacing the ""see more like this""? Secondly, hitting the next button was an unnecessary addition. However, one thing I do like is the ability to rate the delivery experience."
"The new interface is a huge step backward. Whoever designed and pushed this as an update needs their backside kicked. Clunky and slow on both my phone and tablet. Have tried side loading an older version but won't install. Update 6/11/21: I'm now actually buying some stuff from alternative sources, and your prime deliveries aren't as reliable as they used to be either."
Excellent experience! Notification s if items Unavailable or late delivery 🤔
"Web developers need to improve the user interface when editing settings (Walker, for example) by adding a ""Done"" button, to close out of any particular process. Currently I find it frustrating to have to hit ""back"" button on the browser. There needs to be a way to discern when an action is completed and can be finalized with such a button"
Amazon has outstanding customer service. It took me a while to get comfortable but they really take care of you. Returns could be slightly easier but they offer a huge array of options to return items even without packaging which is amazing. I didn't enjoy my experience with their credit card backed by chase. However they directed me to a card backed by sync bank.
"When shopping in the app on my galaxy s10 the items displayed are so zoomed in and enlarged you have to scroll up and down and side to side just to view 1 item. I just go to the website which is the same interface but without being zoomed in so ridiculously close to everything. Cant find anything in the app that allows me to adjust this so I dont really use it. It is useful only in the sense that my phone gets pop-up pin notifications for my items when they are shipped, delivered, etc."
"The app is slow to load pages and sometimes fails to load photos+ page, when I was able to view items I was impressed with the viriaty available.. shame lag ruins the shopping experience- rather than wasting my time reporting issue and jumping through hoops- I simply went to Argos app instead which works without fault- lost customer due to your app issues!"
"Recent update sucks. Much more laggy. ""Simpler"" user interface makes it hard to find things. Used to be super easy to look at the status of a current order. I don't like the hamburger button for the menu being at the bottom. Each of the four buttons at the bottom take a while to load. The home page also now provides even less relevant information than it used to."
"Great app. A large part of the experience is checking your orders for whatever reason. I try buy it gets caught in a refresh loop where you can't click and type, and struggle to be able to get to your orders in some roundabout way. Been months now, would be great if they could sort it out"
"Extremely Disappointed! Since this last couple of updates, the whole experience is utterly STRESSFUL! HELLO?! Even before covid, I bought EVERYTHING from TP to dress wear and make-up etc. I had trouble with this app glitching after the last two updates, but I found out that it was my Android webview that was the problem. If anyone else is having the same type of problem, look up Android webview and switch to the beta version if that helps anybody. App is working seamlessly now! 👍"
"App is so laggy it is extremely difficult to use. All the unnecessary ads and banners and pop ups and bloat (that also make images bounce around the screen as they load, is absolutely KILLING the experience and convenience, so why even have an app?? Also, what's the point of choosing Amazon day delivery if it never works and the items always just ship separately and whenever?"
"Used to be a very good app but suddenly it has become glitchy. Photos of products don't show properly nor does the little heart to add an item to your wish list which makes it hard to search and save things. I typically like shopping on Amazon but these latest problems with the app is making me, and I'm sure other customers, think twice about using this service. Much better experience shopping on eBay at the moment. Please solve the problem before more people stop shopping with you."
My experience with Amazon is great but everytime I try to sign in I have to use my otp password and everytime I don't remember so I requested if Amazon could just send it back to me in my Gmail but everytime it's not there so I hope Amazon that you fix it and send me a new otp
"Previous update should have been the last other than maintence. The app is now insanely slow after the update- both on 5G cell data and high speed wifi. The previous menu interface was a lot better- less confusion and more overlapping of how to get where I want to be (order history, purchase history, categories etc). Now it's a whole SPECIFIC process to get there. This is really deterring me from making any purchases- photos, descriptions, search results load really slow or will just crash"
"App is generally really nice, clean interface smooth action, crisp transitions to next product. The reason for 3 stars is, I have a few items I ""save for later"" , everytime I log on there is always a message in my cart about ""new information of a product Your cart"" when I click on this link, well nothing happens. System freezes on a blank screen."
"It works, mostly. They keep shoveling more and more website UX into the app, creating a sluggish, frustrating, sub-par experience. It's 2023 and I'm on a Galaxy S23 Ultra running up-to-date stock 13 ... I expect better than 15- to 30-second delays between tapping the screen and STARTING to redraw. This app has the performance of a Commodore 64. Still, Amazon IS consistent: their Alexa app is just as sluggish, laggy, and equally barely useable."
"They are a scam, customer support is 0 They sending wrong packages and expect you to pay for them. Worse experience I ever had with online shopping."
Worst experience i've ever been to & the most ruuuuude customer service i've eveeer dealed with. I uninstalled it immediately & i will never use it or order from it ever again
ok off the top most expensive and the amount is a bit low costs are a bit more flexible than I thought it would like you are looking for the best experience of my account direct to my house to get things done to the right value of your life good situation here but Amazon is the only way that you can get a good feel for the transaction on your website and you can get a new phone number and a new direction in life for me I can give me to be able help out and help me to establish a chance to work
I will not pay MORE to get rid of ads. I already pay.... You are just greedy! And you wonder why more and more people are turning to IPTV! Forced ads ruin the experience and you just don't get it!
"BEWARE!! Amazon is the WORST online shopping experience of my life! Account was put on hold and trying to fix it was unbelievably stressful and difficult. You can't just call and fix it, they want you to send pictures of your debit card, ID, a pdf of your bank statements along with other things and it's just ridiculous. I'm not sending all of that info out into the internet to a stranger. There's no other way to fix it so I uninstalled app and won't use again. ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!"
The screen keeps freezing while I'm scrolling. Very annoying. The recommendations page is terrible. You can't clear stuff you're not interested in and then my recommendations become full of stuff I'm not interested in with no way to fix it. It didn't use to do this. I'm not happy with Amazon as a whole right now. I do a lot of shopping with Amazon and I pay for Prime. It's disappointing that everything seems to be moving away from a personal experience.
Very clunky experience trying to view order information. This is very annoying at time when cell coverage may not be the best trying to load multiple pages to get the order number when on the phone with support. I would like to see an order summary page that shows all of my orders with the order number and dollar amount in the same page. Also when viewing products the audio for the videos does not work.
Although I've usually had good experiences with prime this one was way different. I had to cancel my order because I don't have the money. (I did in the bank but not for free spending) I tried cancelling the order 4 times. 3 cancel orders requests were sent. So I spent the money I had (the reason I canceled the order) stupidly assuming it would go through. The order cancellation did not go through. Lesson learned. I love prime but please make sure u absolutely want your order before purchasing.
"I like Prime and use it a lot, but this app drove me nuts! Like others have said, the design is all off. The design team needs to be called in and shown all of these comments. Way too in-your-face bright and carnival-y to be a comfortable shopping experience. Yes, sites have to change over time, but not like this. I'll come back when you've figured it out."
"1 Step For ward, 2 Steps Back in my opinion. Previous version of the app worked absolutely fine, the one thing it was missing was the ability to filter results by price. That's now been added in, but now the user interface is just an absolute minefield. Used to get you straight to the info you wanted in 1 click, now it's going to a page, scrolling, going into a sub menu etc. Notifications also now don't work - previously I'd get continuous tracking updates, now it rarely even tells me anything."
"APP CRASHES EACH LOAD TIME!!! Fourth attempt to load this app. Uninstalled and reinstalled several times; it crashes each time right after loading. I did get to experience using the app a little before it starting continuously crashing. Now, it will load and immediately crash although it installs fine. Mutiple crash reports have been submitted. Please fix!"
"Nothing has changed even after contacting support! Multiple search results appear too large (like in desktop view). It's difficult to see anything and I need to constantly swipe left/right. This interface is useless in the app and still hasn't been fixed. And yes, I deleted and downloaded the app several times like support suggested - it did not help. It also looks like this from another phone, so the issue is not with my device."
"This app is only good for tracking shipments. Browsing Amazon is so much easier on an actual browser with tabs. On devices with larger screens (ZFold 4) the experience is horrible, the app is not able to take advantage of screen real estate, just blowing up the UI in size instead of allowing you to see more info. Lack of tabbed browsing, and poor usage of higher screen resolution make this app very unuseful for shopping."
"New app interface is horrible. I don't know who thought it was a good idea! It makes it miserable to use the app now. Unless they change it back to the classic layout, I'm forced to delete this awful new version! CHANGE IT BACK AMAZON! We pay you too much, to make our buying experience complicated!"
Doesn't feel like much of a better experience over the website on a mobile browser. Can we get a dark mode?
"The app is good and all, but I have to delete it just to log out. Everywhere I look says to go to menu>your acoount>log out but the option does not even exist. I've searched the entirety of the settings about 3 times and came up with nothing. Other people who experienced the same problem, and posted on answer forums not related to amazon, were also told to go to the account menu (as if we didn't already check there first). I would just really appreciate the ability to log out without going the through the hassle of reinstalling."
Bridgette from customer service closed the chat on me WITHOUT telling me. She was not helpful and made my experience with the issue even worse than it already was
It was ok but this recent update ruined the experience. The app always used excessive data but now it is terrible. Somehow browsing for 10 minutes uses more data than watching a 10+ minute video on YouTube. Since this update the app is extremely laggy and even heats my phone up which it never did. Not only that but sometimes pages don't even load or when they eventually do they are missing half the stuff requiring me to go to the previous page and try again. There's plenty more wrong.....
"Amazon is faithful. Through the pandemic this was sometimes the fastest and easiest (and even the only way) to get essential and nonessential items. I have had great experiences on rare occasions when it was necessary to call customer service. I love the vast product selection, the ability to ship to multiple addresses, shipping speed, and my Amazon Wallet!"
"The search engine kills the experience. It is very difficult to find the item being searched for. Often times, there are too many listings for a certain item that appears to be the exact same thing with slightly different wording and different prices. I have copied key words from titles of items and searched for them and still, the listing I copied is buried in the results. I might find it by clicking something related and then look through the window of related items I might actually find it."
great interface. easy to use and it's amazon.
"Let me see. I gotta figure out how to describe my experience with Amazon shopping where I bought some stuff. And it's wrong. Call nastrom, bout, shouldn't it back get my refund? And the only thing I got. Was where we'll make you a thanks I received. I will send you a return to clip. I spent 2 weeks or 3 weeks now. I aint saying nothing. So is my experience good? No, not one bill. My phone number is 6015 tw 48. If somebody wants to call me and talk to me about it, you're more than welcome too"
wonderful shopping experience that's convenient options price quality products
"You can't buy ANY digital code with Gift Card balance? What's even the point of buying someone a gift card that's FOR AMAZON specifically, just to be told you can't spend it on what you choose. Good job 👍 great shopping experience"
"Found a hard to find book on here, so wide range of books, but account creation was IMPOSSIBLE. I created an account, tried to sign in, said email was already used. Reset password (which I set 2 minutes ago) didn't work, did it again, worked, gave me an almost impossible recaptcha, and then asked for my password again, gave me another recaptcha, asked for my password a third time, and then I signed in to a UI that looks like it came from 2011. Lots of products but terrible user interface."
4 one time passwords (confirmed correct by amazon) 4 times not accepted by the delivery driver. No clear way to cancel items you haven't received yet. Very very poor experience over all. Live chat help that is clearly from a script. What's the point in having security with one time passwords if they aren't working correctly. Pointless and a waste of time.
"Bought product, empty box arrived, filed a replacement, got charged a second time for not returning contents of empty box. Terrible experience."
"Recently on startup this app just hangs while it waits for advertising to load that shows a spinning disc if scrolling down the page & won't respond until that's finished. Can't type to search or go to other tabs until it's done whatever it's trying to do. If I clear the storage & cache on the app it's fine again, but next time I use the app it does the same annoying freeze up. Terrible user experience when I know exactly what I want to buy and I have to wait. This happens on both of my devices"
"Recently I've found the update to be a bit frustrating. One update in particular, the filter options. Although I don't mind the new placement, you can no longer (as far as I've seen) filter by price. That is usually what my shopping experience has been about. I don't mind the recommended items, the 4 stars and up etc. But if I've gotta sit on this app and search for something i feel suits me..I don't want to have to spend 30-40 minutes on it. After a while i just give up, saves me money i guess"
"Very easy to use, browse, and purchase. Nearly anyone can grasp the idea of how to online shop with amazon. On top of that, it has one of the quickest and easiest customer services I've had the pleasure of working with... However, it doesn't have the greatest user interface, at least not on mobile. Reviews and customer pictures are flushed to the bottom of a very lengthy page. There should be a tab you can select to quickly scroll your screen to your desired point of view. 4 Stars!"
"This has been a great app for the most part. I have had issues with small technical things, like I attempt to click on an image to make it bigger but it won't load. It doesn't always load all the information on the site. However I have been able to use Amazon seamlessly and if there has been any problem with orders I get it sent straight to my phone instead of having to check my email. I only took away one star because of the interface issues and small technical problems that they're aware of."
"Mostly a good experience, but I've had multiple problems with sellars and I still havent gotten a refund from a month ago. Its great for tracking your products and finding things you need or want without leaving the house. I really do like amazon, the app is more expensive than wish at some products but in so many ways I prefer it. I really love amazon and I've only had a few problems with them and the customer service being snippy with me but it's a good app and very trustworthy."
"Had this app for years and it was GREAT (5 stars)! Something's happened since Jan 9th, 2023 (as far as I can tell) and the app now doesn't fully function with my account. Previous orders show only for this year and to view older orders I must now filter by year. Even then it only shows some of the orders for each of those years. Home page sometimes doesn't fully load and other functions have become unstable on my Sony Xperia 5 III running Android 13. Better experience with the website, by far!"
"Please FIX SAMSUNG DEX optomization! I use Samsung Dex for most of my computer needs does the job and I shop a lot on Amazon. The app isn't designed for the Dex OS, if you can get a developer to make it optomized for Dex users that be wonderful! Most the photo thumbnails are blow up and won't scroll though the menu photos when you are viewing an item. This doesn't give the feel of a good user experience! Thank you."
"good shopping app for anyone looking to get a convenient shopping experience right from their phone, tablet or other device! Amazon offers cool things like Amazon gift card services, shipping to other people though I don't think it is available in all states or to all states yet. Amazing app with no glitches or issues. Really makes for a much smoother experience, where I'm at the internet signal is pretty good and this makes it a lot easier when the pages don't crash. Ease of shopping/navigation"
Being locked out of my account for using my own card has ro be the qorst experience ever. I only gave Amazon 1 ⭐ because i couldn't gove them 0
No english language is available. The worst experience ever.
I never received my item they are awful 😞 they're really suck horrible experience with them i will never shop for Amazon ever again I ordered coolwater perfume from them and I never received it they would get no stars please do not order from Amazon they are so mean and disrespectful people
"Not best user experience. Does what it is supposed to do, but one area is extremely clunky and not friendly. Filtering orders. I can't filter orders to see ones that are shipped (but I can see not shipped, what use is there?). I can't filter to see ones that are out for delivery. I can't see ones where return was requested, so I end up scrolling back and forth to find labels during return dropoff. Basically it is inconvenient in its basic shopping functions"
"Overall interface is ok. The search function is a bit strange in how it deals with the back button but is acceptable. one recurring issue is that I have notifications set on, order things regularly, and have literally never received a notification indicating when my package has arrived, or any other shipment updates."
"The app is really bad lately, the order history keep disappearing and I have to reinstall the app to see it, everytime when you open the app you see adverts, first it was about the lord of the rings, now is prime access to sale or something, very irritating. There is no legal information if you click it it says: we can't find the page. Overall very bad experience lately."
I shop a lot on Amazon and the app has always been user friendly and efficient. However during the last week it has stopped/frozen and a pop up asks if I want to close the app or wait. This occurs every few minutes and interrupts the entire shopping experience. Fix this ASAP or else I will be spending much less money this holiday season....
Recently I ordered a Phone through my friend's amazon delivery app since I lost my phone and got 2 packet kleenex tissue delivered. I have ordered it with the trust that it was a product that sell and sold by amazon. It was a terrible experience and they are not ready to issue refund and they even blocked the amazon experience. I have never expected this kind of irresponsible customer service from amazon. I will never ever purchase a thing from amazon and will not recommend it.
Impossible to find the choice to change country/language settings in the new version when you want to find a product in another country and ship over to you. There's a drop down list of options all to do with user experience but nothing for language/region. Why? After Brexit it's important to consider this option to find as easily as before but for some reason it's completely gone or hidden in settings. An American company should be sensitive to the cultural demands of other continents.
"I have ordered from Amazon a few times, not alot though, infact probably less then 10 times, but each of these times I have gotten my things on time, with out any problems. So based off of my experience with Amazon so far, I would highly recommend them, and I definitely give them a thumbs up. I have also noticed their prices to be a little cheaper, which is always in good thing, don't you agree?"
"I am really unhappy with what seems to be a new delivery system. I have always received my order via USPS, FedEx, or UPS. I just recently started receiving from what seems like independent deliverers. I have not had good experiences with these independent deliverers. I don't want to order anything anymore because I usually have an issue with the delivery. I don't think I will use Amazon for my shopping if this keeps up. I am really disappointed in this way of delivering. I have always enjoyed shopping with Amazon but will not continue with the way it is going 😔"
"Used to be a phenomenal app, but the new interface is absolutely appalling and confusing, and if you use Dark Mode in Android 10 and 11 (which is most people!) you literally can't even see what you have typed in the search bar! That error was fixed in the previous app version, but it hasn't retained any of the previous version preferences. Please fix it."
"I've had good initial experience with Amazon, but then they blocked me from reviewing the garbage I've bought from them. I then made a new account. I bought two used items because usually they're like new as described. But their quality dropped badly. One item was missing parts, another missing completely. No QC at all. The app doesn't even help for shopping, only for your orders and tracking. This monopoly needs to die."
"Absolutely the worst shopping app ever. You can not look for an item and see the item you look for. For example. Look up the ps5 console, they will not show it with out hundreds of accessories. Even if you filter a search and choose the filter to only show the ps5 console, you can't. They force feed you garbage accessory results making it a miserable shopping experience."
"Overall I love Amazon, my only complaint with this app is that the filter options do not work anymore. I can select filters, but they never apply to my search. There's no apply button and when I toggle the filer box after selecting my filters nothing happens. The only button that works is the PRIME toggle button, not even the PRIME option in the filters, I've already reinstalled the app. A fix/update to correct this would really be nice and would create a better shopping experience."
"ALWAYS SLOW! Browsing for items is an awful experience, takes long to fully load searches, especially when viewing products and it's description and reviews. It seems like the lag is caused by the excessive banner ads and recommendations, and who knows what else (collecting every bit of user data). It is causing me to avoid shipping on Amazon altogether because it is so slow. Shopping on the web browser on Amazon's website is 10x faster and loads quicker, the app is slow and always has been."
"A disappointing, infuriating experience. This is just an app with an embedded browser. It's a PWA, but the browser engine is TERRIBLE. The performance is several times worse than the website on Chrome/Firefox mobile. Navigation takes 10s to render, 25s to fully load. Changing a color/size of an item causes a 30+ second hang EVERY TIME. On a flagship smartphone. This is pathetic. Only use for notifications. Better performance plus ad/tracking block just by using Firefox."
Used to be an amazing Shopping experience. Now if I need to make a return I have to pay for labels. If the item is only five dollars its counter productive. I never used to need to print labels but now it's all the time. 1 Of the reasons I love amazon is because if you don't like something you could return it with no charge. Everything is changing to make more money. It's a shame.it looks like I'm going to have to find another shopping app
As a Amazon Prime member I like using this app. However I notice it has been gotten a bit worse. Lately I tried to filter out my search in order to get the things I need. Like 90% it glitches and does not work. Besides that interface could be more smoother. I like the Amazon but this app could be better in my opinion. Update: they have sorted of fixed the filtering feature but it's far from perfect. It's a bit laggy but doable...
Browser experience is far better. Everything I tried to do is more difficult on the app. I don't get as good results when doing a search and there aren't nearly as many filters for sorting those results. If you want to sign out of the app so as to switch accounts there is absolutely no way to sign out of this app after you sign in. If this app is on your device the browser will always send you to the app so you cannot use another account. The Help menu applied to browser not the app.
"The sole reason for 1 star, is because of the search bar being changed to the bottom. This is THE MOST annoying and frustrating change an app has ever done in an update. I'm constantly pressing wrong buttons now, and the user experience of the app and service is downgraded so much because of this huge change. If it's not broken, don't fix it!!"
Horrible Experience returning 4 items... ive never had an issue before this But this week was DIFFERENT and I had to jump through hoops to get my money back PER AMAZON POLICY? And was ONLY able to recoup MY MONEY via Amazon Credit.. . More that a week now and It still Never came when they said it would? So Obviously I had to call customer service AGAIN now here I am AGAIN waiting for my Refund to be released to an Amazon CREDIT 😑 Great Customer service Jeff .... .
"The shopping experience is not bad, but the UI sucks so bad."
When I'm scrolling to view any of the products on lightening deal it's a blank screen so I have to click to view whatever it is. I get notifications for roll filaments everytime they're on a deal I don't care nor do I want to buy a roll of plastic. Would it not make more sense to send me deals I've bought in the past. The app is so sloppy it's not good at all. It's more of an inconvenience if anything! The app should be an easier experience then using google but it's really not!! Thumbs down...
"Can honestly say I have used the app for several years no problem but since the change of the app interface, I am no longer able to see delivery dates when multiple purchasing. The app almost forces you into subscribe and save and makes it difficult to make one off purchases. There was nothing wrong with the former layout, but the removal of the top left menu and buttons on the lower makes it harder to navigate. it also implies someone is trying to justify there position within the company."
"Please make language settings more sticky! Even though I use two languages and live in a bilingual country, I prefer to standardize interfaces across apps. For some reason Amazon's keeps switching languages. Looks like a documented bug. I don't understand why this app is trying to guess which language a user might want to see - let's have it set in the preferences and keep it that way until the user wants to switch."
"Amazing up until the recent sluggish redesign. It feels like the new app was written with no optimisation or user experience in mind. Switching tabs is slow, pages/views are rendered sluggishly, accessing account areas takes much longer than before, and everything is much harder to find. The current app is far cry from the quality I've come to expect and count on by Amazon. Quite sad to see this level of quality from a company so famed for it's optimisation and continuous refinement."
"Amazon shopping is a great app! I have used it now for several years and the only thing I have ever had difficulty with ordering are shoes...just never seem to order the correct size no matter how closely I follow the directions. But the interface is great, great search engine and you can find everything on here. Definitely worth checking out if you're new to online shopping very easy to navigate."
"Update 6/22/2020: the app has become so unresponsive that it's borderline unusable. Also I noticed that it was getting order tracking numbers confused in the app and getting the correct information was only available through the web interface which isn't convenient when picking up packages and needing the correct tracking. Found a solution. Uninstall the app, and add Amazon to your home screen from Chrome. It will install a web app that actually works"
One of the best but basic customer service experiences you can find. Real fast delivery options and secure lockers if you decide that instead of your address. The app is simple and easy to use. You can also track your package and see exactly how many stops away the driver is. The ads are too much and some customers feel outraged by them.
"I normally have had really good experiences with Amazon & with my last few orders, my experiences have been negative. I ordered one item a couple of weeks ago, it was marked as delivered, but I never received it & it didn't get delivered to my neighbors either. I was refunded for that order. I ordered the same item last week & I get an email this morning saying that it has shipped, but I check my Amazon account & it says that the item is undeliverable & my order has been canceled. Not happy."
"It works, but after shutdown of PrimeNow app and integration of Whole Foods grocery, the experience is worse. Most frustrating is not being able to have two different default addresses selected for the Amazon and Grocery sections of the App. Requires constant toggle of home versus WF store address. Overall, updates to app in last year have not improved usability much, but have required relearning layout. Also, multiple presses to do common tasks,like get back to home screen. App is slower too."
"(1) Search results are basically ads and irrelevant to the search criteria. The recent updates have basically screwed up the shopping experience. (2) I don't understand the need for the so called ""influencers"" popping up on the homepage. I can decide for myself what I need. I would recommend moving them to a different tab or at the bottom. Waste of space that can be used for something better."
"As a Prime Member who orders quite often, it shouldn't be this difficult now to do the following: Sort without losing 1000s of results. Sort within the category. Why do you have to keep going back and forth to filter the subcategory? Navigate. There should be an option to see all results on one page instead of this never ending next button. This new experience is very time consuming. These issues are very important for variety shoppers and needs to be addressed as soon as possible."
"I have been a prime member since the beginning. All their applications have gotten terrible. Their customer service is horrible. Can I get one person that speaks english clearly? From my experience no. Even explaining simple issues is impossible. Their English comprehension just isn't adequate enough for problem solving. I get out for delivery notifications and nothing comes then they send me out for delivery notifications 10 days later for the same items. Call in to ask about what is going on and the answer is always ""I don't know"". Well I will spend my money somewhere else. All services are canceled."
This app is the slowest most unreliable app I have ever experienced. Every other app will work perfectly fine but Amazon needs like lightening fast speeds and the greatest internet connection in the world before it decides it wants to work. I have a Samsung galaxy s8 and there is no excuse for how pathetic an app it has been over the years.
"Customer service is difficult and infuriating. I love the user experience that this app provides, but ever since I got a new number I haven't been able to reset it. I've tried disabling the two factor authentication, it still wants me to verify my identity with only my phone number. It would be completely fine if I could verify with my email, but unfortunately, no such luck. I've called customer service multiple times, I still cannot access my account."
"Why do companies insist on changing things that work perfectly well? The most recent update has changed the filtering system. Instead of something that overlays the main body of the app like before, clicking on ""filter"" now opens its own new page, and it will shove you back to the product list on each filter change. It is also slower to load than before. It was a much more fluid experience before."
"In the Deliveries section of the Subscribe & Save, it would be really helpful if it showed the total cost of that delivery and not just the individual prices of the items being sent. That way I know the full amount my card will be charged after it's all shipped. Otherwise, I absolutely LOVE ❤️ the app!! I never experience any slow loading others have mentioned. I literally will spend 8 hours at a time, couple times a week, looking for the perfect items to add to my cart and buy on pay day!!"
"Unfortunately I have to write my first negative experience of Amazon. Long story short I found a promotion that showed up online and in the app. I put the items in my cart that matched the terms of the promotion, did not apply. So I chatted with customer service who assured me how to fix this problem, then randomly got told I needed a call back. So I did that, and after an hour of transfers, the promotion page magically said this is no longer available. I am beyond disappointed and frustrated."
"Amazon doesn't care about customer experience anymore. Why force a portion of the users into Beta testing this ridiculous new UI without a means to opt out? The search bar on the bottom is nothing short of a ridiculous inconvenient change that pretty much no one asked for. It does not make sense to put it there. After wasting a total of 1.5 hrs on two separate calls asking to be opted out with no help. I canceled Prime and requested a full refund. Speak with your wallets folks, dump Amazon."
"Love Amazon. Used to love shopping with this app. Beginning about a week ago, it glitches and freezes so often. About to stop shopping with it because the experience is so awful. It even is so bad it double ordered an item. Once the glitching, freezing, and crashing is fixed then this will go back to a five star review."
Looping through the same options when im trying to return an item is extremely draining. Been waiting almost two months. Says its lost. Cant get to a point of actually returning or refunding cause it just says speak to the seller. Amazons the seller. Talk to customer support. Which item. Talk to seller. Amazons the seller. Which item. Talk to the seller....awful experience. At very least it is overwhelmingly discouraging. So appearantly im just out 300. Guess ill just kick rocks
"App now takes over the popup that appears when you select text (in Google Chrome web browser for example). ""🔍Amazon"" now appears front and center which disrupts the user experience"
"Since the latest update the app shows I have never placed an order. I've been an Amazon customer for ten years and suddenly have no order history. I've now turned off auto update (in Play Store, it's in the 3-dot menu, top right) - next time remind me to check reviews when each new update's had a few weeks' non-consensual beta testing for the lazy developers to fix what they just broke! (It's a poor experience anyway but I do sometimes need to select an order to track, or refund... 🙄)"
"Horrible car part shopping interface / user experience. The prior design worked well. I'm not sure what prompted them to reinvent the wheel. It seems whomever designed the new interaction has never own a car or bought parts (do some user research folks... buy a book on it). Sorry but this is a Sad, sad, sad design. Kudos for generating an emotional response though... I felt disgusted and so compelled to write this silly review in hopes someone at Amazon gets a clue.... :-)"
"The Devs need to concentrate on what matters: the customer experience, and not change for change's sake A few months back they introduced a new UI, and I've given it fair time to prove itself but, I hate it! It's made things way more of a guessing game to find functionality than ever before; not helped by there now being two menu bars!? But worst of all is that this app is now so painfully slow to use. In both cases, things are getting so bad that I've frequently resorted to using the website!"
"My last two shopping experiences were pretty horrible! The previous time, I had to talk to customer service twice for 20+(?) minutes to get the free shipping I was led to expect, resulting in a store credit, not an immediate refund! The recent experience was so frustrating I was left hyperventilating for maybe 20 minutes, desperately trying to get my order accepted correctly by the app that was running me around and thwarting me! Even the order confirmation left me uncertain about my order!."
"Why are the reviews hard to access? Have to press the review section multiple times. So annoying. Shopping experience changed for the worst. I use to love this app; enjoyed shopping, strolling through pictures & reviews. The pics are choppy, uneasy to scroll through, & there's a stutter/hesitation between pictures. I have to swipe hard, 2- 3 times to get to the next picture. Zooming use to be smoother. Although I've upgraded my phone & wifi, this app is slower than any other shopping app"
"The latest update is terrible! The app has become very very slow. The whole description of the product doesn't appear on the top of the page when you click on the suggestions provided. The options/colors etc of the product disappears if you swipe left to see all of them. The menu feature takes about 25 seconds to load. Overall frustrating experience. Many times ive just gone to directly to the product website to order there instead or just close the app and mind my other business, which is good."
never had a bad experience shopping with Amazon. Returns are easy if you make a mistake their customer service is unparalleled.
"The reason I'm heavily downgrading this app is the very stupid interface handling links from emails or Google app. I look for a product in Google app & there is a listing for a product from Amazon. I click on the link, it calls the app, but never goes directly to the linked product. Usually, though not always, there is not even a list of possible candidates for the description - that's bad. I emailed a link to print a label, clicked the link, and it doesn't go to the print label page - stupid!"
"An aggravating experience. Their customer service is lousy. I have been flagged unnecesarily twice for making purchases, and then locked out for it. Trying to get someome to give me access again has been time consuming. Like a lot of companies, they prefer to use an automated system which takes too much time to navigate. Not happy at all."
"Shopping experience is great but something is broken in your code. When I'm in my cart and I swipe from right to left to save an item for later, the entire UI below the light blue delivery info bar shifts and pushes the contents directly into the very left side of my screen. This doesn't happen when I swipe the other way around. It's like the left side padding ceases the exist and it's very odd. I though maybe I needed to update the app and I did so.....issue is still there though."
"Great Amazon prime asap shipping, but the usual miserable experience trying to search for anything on Amazon. Can't believe they have still not fixed their awful UX. If I search for something specific, I do not want the billion things that are only VAGUELY related to a single keyword. Just add exact search quote function (ie ""this and only this"") PLEASE. (This literally makes me regularly shop elsewhere for higher price, just so I don't have to deal with that nightmare!)"
"I'm just reading all the reviews, and for the first time I would advise customers to beware of this app is it seems cause more problems and it's worse. I would search Amazon the way we all have previously. This is an app that Amazon got completely wrong should scrap it and recode it so it's easier for the clients. This ad in the seems to have been developed to benefit Amazon, not the customer. This app does not the make the customer shopping experience any better, but it makes it worse."
"The app is great, staff is very good and friendly, shipping speed is amazing. The biggest problem with Amazon is that most of the products are made in China which makes very poor quality products from my experience. I understand plastic is needed for product profitability but China even uses cheap brittle types of plastics."
"I hate shopping because of Amazon. This is the worst experience I have in shopping online. The team is not qualified, most of the items with no good material, they don't respect time, they don't respect anything, I highly recommend not to use it, you will get a high blood pressure because of Amazon"
"Poorly executed app. It will not show your orders or purchase history unless you order directly from the app, which makes the app useless. I use my PC and Chrome on my phone sometimes, as well, and both provide a far superior experience. The app doesn't even recognize my Prime membership, even though I'm logged in. My PC and phone do. Until Amazon fixes this, I will not be using the app."
Really? ads in between my orders... I don't pay prime for ads experience
I got charged over 100 riyals when i tried to add my card. I still did not get my money back.. the worst experience i got
My experience has been more good than bad even with the bad the customer service representatives were very helpful.
"Great experiences, most of the time , resolves issues"
You should consider changing the user interface.....to be nicer and simple.
searching is a little difficult but overall great experience
Disgusting user experience and app în general. Trying to buy for uk and shows me only prices and location of us. C l o w n s
Not any issue with the app and highly recommend Amazon for most online buying and selling compared to eBay. Had many BAD experiences with ebay making a purchase of one item and being charged for a different item with a much larger price in a different country from the seller I made the purchases from but the issues were resolved in 48 hours by eBay since I had screenshots everytime and pictures with my back up phone as proof and still received the items quite a bit later due to issue.
"I just had the worst experience with an Amazon c.s. representive. I bought a Bible and some highlighters to bless a love one who is going through a painful time and the Bible has been delaid twice, and now a third time. Taking 3 times to get it than what I paid and ask for. They said they'll replace it, but now I ""just have to wait! So they took my money immediatly but my brother won't get the Words he so desprepredly needs to hear till Amazon feels like getting around to deliver the Bible. Smh"
"While the app is refined enough to allow an easy shopping experience, its also a minefield of scammy subscriptions that you will automatically be subscribed to unless you opt out upon every purchase. We all know that amazon doesnt treat its workers very well, especially in other countries, and this is why i try to leave amazon as a last resort for buying products. Its caught me out a couple of times over the last 2 years and ive missed the automatic subscription that has left me out of pocket."
"I don't know how Amazon has managed to get so much worse. It has totally won the award for one of the worst shopping experiences you can ever have. More often than not you're going to have an issue with an order or two. However, if it's in the smaller percentiles it can be manageable. Again however, only if, it's in the lower percentile. About has not been my experience. It's just about every single order something goes. And customer, service has gotten so much worse. Horrific experiencesssss."
Horrible experience. Set up credit card for monthly prime payment but the debit card I use for purchases was charged instead. Caused an overdraft they would do nothing about. Then set up for a reminder to cancel before next charge and the app did not remind me. Can sure tell me what AMAZON would like me to buy from them tho! Canceling end of the month and never using this again.
"Your dynamic pricing strategy has made me shop elsewhere when Amazon was my go-to shopping platform! Also, Sponsored items ruin the search results viewing experience - there are way too many thrown in throughout!! Pay for Prime, but the delivery date provided on orders ends up arriving 2 or more days later. Just be honest about your shipping timeframes!"
"it's way more expensive than other apps (Temu, TikTok shop, Ali express, etc) also a personal experience I had with it was when I was using my gift card ordered like 4 items one item was $23 and i decided I didn't want it anymore never got a refund in my gift card balance and btw the item never came in I just decided I wanted something else and the gift card history says that it never happened so I just lost $23 that i used to get 1 item that's never gonna come get another cheaper app"
"Love Amazon but I hate their new app interface layout. Why place the menu button at the bottom left of the screen? Just felt much better & easier to use when they just had one menu access button(the three lined button that took you to recent orders, account etc) at the top left corner if the screen. For people who generally use their phone with their left hand it sucks. A way to edit button locations would be great so these stupid needless changes don't feel forced on us."
"I would consider giving better reviews but maybe it's that time of year for hardships. my package stated delivered but never actually arrived. However, the refund or item replacement process was very convenient and made my experience delightful. it was automated but concise. packages should be handled with better care. I understand things are in demand, but if it were the delivers packages being delivered, you'd want it to be taken cared of as if it were yours. But 4 stars!"
"I am getting sick and tired of amazon constantly changing the user interface for its app. Every single time i have to go on a hunt to find out where now the designers have hidden the manage subscriptions menu. Change for the sake of change causes more harm than good. Each time there is an interface change i dont see any positives. Clients have to relearn the location of all the menus all over again? Seriously, what is amazon doing? Is this a game? What value is amazon trying to bring?"
"The add to compare button is irritating & makes the shopping experience unbearable. If I want to compare items I will do so myself. Forcing it as the only option is a horrible idea. To See what I'm talking about search the word ""fan"" and everything just has a add to compare button no add to cart. Where is the Add to cart button on the result page? Now I have to either compare or click into each item in order to add to cart? After some searches there is add to cart and sometimes no button at all."
"App doesn't load anymore! In the last four weeks the app keeps showing its ""Uh-oh! Something went wrong on our end."" message. No resolution, no update, no bug fix patch, and no communication from Amazon as to why. And it wasn't fixed in time for Black Friday! Really unexpected show. The computer-version works okay, and it's a faff trying to use Chrome or IE on my phone and NOT have it redirect to the broken app. Good service in itself, but very poor user experience on the mobile app."
"The app used to be preferable to the website, but recent updates have removed the ""what customers bought after viewing this item"" section which I found incredibly useful for comparisons. Sorting by anything other than ""featured"" removes most of the search results. Poor experience via the app. Amazon prices have been creeping up for a while, but with my prime membership I preferred the convenience. My prime has now expired, and the app is a frustration to use, so there isn't much to keep me."
my experience is usually very good. But I have found that a lot of the merchant pricing is becoming equal to or more expensive than what you could purchase that item for on other websites or walking into a retail location. But when I do order from Amazon you get very fast service and they back what they sell and they have made it easier for returns.
"Customer support systematically lies. Shipping dates are intentionally falsified. I've had many explanations and Shipping details on my most recent order. Can't get a straight answer out of anyone and I've confirmed the customer support agents have lied many times. Has been an awful experience. Worst part, the item in question still has the wrong shipping date on the items description. Amazon is aware this date is wrong and is still telling people it is correct."
"The app tries to work like the website now but A) if I want to have the website experience I'm going to use the website B) 90% of the time I end up with ""page doesn't exist"" when trying to add anything to my wishlist or shopping cart You can scroll through pictures anymore or two the heart to add something to your list. Terrible shopping experience."
"Regularly, the app refuses to load a product I am looking at. Gives me a pic of a dog and says ""something went wrong."" I am certain this is not on my end, as it is random and unrelated to my internet connection strength. I have experienced it in multiple phones, over multiple years. I would say it's an 85% chance the product page loads, meaning 15% of the time it fails. Sometimes, I was just looking at a page, I leave it for a moment, and when I come back it won't load again. No internet change"
"I mean, it's Amazon, what's there not to like?! Perfectly balanced interface for tech-savvy people to use or non-technical people to use with ease and comfort. Easy change of country/region/language if you travel and use the same account. Personal information is well protected (since I hav been using it for years and no security breaches have happened). Many delivery options with special instructions like leave at door, building reception/garage/back door etc. Great customer service as well."
"No no no! You are sucking Amazon by placing the search bar at the bottom of my app. I hate that. It's always been at the top. You should allow us to choose where we want to place it instead of trying to frustrate 😤 your customers by placing it at the bottom, which is incredibly stupid! Plus, you don't make it easy to leave feedback about the experience on your app. This is basically just giving the middle finger to your customers. Shame on you!"
"Not intuitive interface, worse than the old. Once you type anything in Search, it's impossible to delete it, only overwrite with something else. Somehow, the app started pointing to my US site, it was absolutely impossible to re-point it back to Oz, amazon help desk was useless. Had to uninstall and install again."
Easy to use and simple. Amazon is as expected on here. The wishlists could use some improvement from my experience but I will spend the time fixing mine up so they are how I prefer. I turn off notifications so I don't know about them but it functions well and I haven't had any issues other than the wishlists being a bit difficult compared to how I would like them
"The new update is very buggy. Items are not loading and I constantly am getting the "" uh oh looks like something went wrong "" message. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app numerous times, ran internet connectivity tests, nothing helps. The new layout is bothersome, but it doesn't affect my experience too much. My mate complaints is that the app is almost unusable now after the update."
"Indescribable. Such an amazing app/store/lifechanging innovation. I am so inspired, moved and touched by Amazon and my experiences with them. Here is an app that made a name for itself and has spread around the world. Jeff Bezos, hats off to you. I mean, honestly. The customer service is phenomenal, the little notes that they leave for example giving me free shipping all day and for what?To show appreciation for my business. Heard it's a great company to work for & love all the charity they do!"
"you've got to be cautious/careful, and study details/reviews; & of course look at every little detail, (example; shipping preference, payment preference, etc) before placing final order. Just because it's amazon, it's still the real world out there. I think they go to great lengths to make your shopping experience a great one. I recommend to be patient/careful with placing your order/s. Thanks, amazon for making shopping an environmentally smart/satisfying choice - 07/17/23 - L.R.K."
"Real crappy interface. Many options are hidden away, and most of them don't even function. For example, there are official guides on Amazon's website on changing the shipping address on an order, but the only real way to do this is cancel the order, select the option ""CHANGING THE SHIPPING ADDRESS"", then pay extra to buy something because it has artificially ""increased in price."" Quite infuriating. BONUS: Prime membership cancellation is a pain, too, and sometimes they charge you anyway. 👍"
"horrible experience with newest Amazon app update. colour choices, sizes, or any kind of options do not update in the shopping cart, and ordering has become impossible whenever a choice needs to be made. app just hangs, stalls, or just chooses the default colour or choice into shopping cart, even though a different choice was made on the item page. I don't know how this app update ever went live. TERRIBLE UPDATE."
"Changes were senseless. This app has went from a good user friendly app to one of the worst. Since the update I have experienced nothing but frustration. The filter is terrible, it no longer drops down and can only do one selection at a time. The app then freezes up so it then becomes a long waiting game. Wishlist was always visible and simple to drag items to list but thats changed for the worst and will freeze up when deleting an item from the list. Don't fix what's not broken."
"Great app, we use it all the time with little to no issues. Had an issue today where an item shows delivered but was just not there, that could be the fault of USPS, but there isn't an option in the return or replace for an item that shows delivered but wasn't. I'd give 5 stars if they added that. In the past when there have been delivery issues, their customer service has been top notch and quick to resolve things. Overall a very positive experience."
"The app is very well laid out. I find it very easy to find exactly what I am looking for. My shopping from beginning to end is done in under a minute or 2. Amazon is my go to for just about everything strictly because of ease of use and expedience. The only area that I get frustrated with is trying to locate my subscriptions to streaming services. It is somewhat hidden, and you can't cancel a service from your phone. I find this to go against my usual customer experience with Amazon."
"New version - rubbish user interface - change for the sake of change. Just about every function has moved to a new place, and usually requires more clicks now to get to what we need. Why ?! Seems that some people just can't help ""improving"" something that works in order to look busy. Now easier just to use a Web browser and forget the app."
"So, this app is largely OK. Decent shopping experience, however, if you shop exclusively with gift cards like me (malware concern), you're likely going to run into a problem at some point. For some reason, even when you're above the 25$ minimum for free shipping, it will still auto everything you're ordering to standard over free. This normally wouldn't be an issue, but if you don't have enough to pay for it, it won't allow you to go to the next page to change it to free so you can afford it."
All in all a great experience with the app. For some reason I can no longer get this app to open from web links in an email in my Outlook app. Everything keeps opening in Chrome and there seems to be no way to force this app to open for the list of supported urls.
"First time I used Amazon was back in 2014 as a college student. I've loved it since. Only ever had a handful of issues and they were primarily with the delivery service companies (UPS, etc..) The app has never done me wrong. I'd have to say this is a top notch app. I've never experienced issues with ordering things with the app. I've rented plenty of books for college and returning them was made simple with these guys."
"For the worlds most used online buying service it sure does have a glitchy, slow, buggy app. Back button doesnt work when viewing product images to exit out of image full screen to product page. I press it multiple times to get the back button to exit the images and it takes me all the way back to the first search I did. Time consuming and annoying. Pages and searches load slow. No other app on my phone does this. Interface for scrolling and choosing things is clunky. App needs a revamp bad.."
"The app is very annoying, when browsing articles it always open some of them if you browse too fast cos it's too sensitive.. It really ruins the experience and it's so unbearable that I close the app and don't even buy what I wanted first... Otherwise i didn't have others issues. Be careful of Amazon prices! Often more expensive than somewhere else and lot of fake articles not controlled... just massive selling platform"
"I didn't find the customer service online chat as accessible via the app compared to using the webpage version of the Amazon site. In fact, the whole user experience seemed slower via the app. I also dislike the way that, even if not deliberately opened, it tends to take over i.e. Amazon links clicked in Chrome tend to open up in the app rather than as a new Chrome tab. I'm actually uninstalling my copy of the app after Amazon failed to honour a £10 opening offer & were unable to explain why."
There's no way to reapply to March on demand they don't even tell u y or give u a reason worst experience I've ever had with a print-on-demand service if your trying to do that another place than here is better cause they actually let u instead of giving excuses and not giving reasons or even letting you have the opportunity to fix it.
"Amazon has intentionally designed it's interface to be confusing to consumers, it is very easy to accidentally sign up to Amazon prime, you receive no notification of having done so, and it is difficult to leave again (having to press many buttons to leave). It is also difficult to browse items as there is poor visibility of postage lead times and costs up front. I will be deleting this app and shopping independently from now on."
"Highly useful and a great purchasing experience, but with one glaring dark pattern: there's only one notification category and no way to disable the ""deal"" notifications without also disabling delivery notifications. It's an obvious dark pattern and the frequency of those notifications has only increased over time. Would be five stars, but it's annoying enough to me to lop off a couple."
"My experience with the app and customer service via chat today was utter trash. In the final steps of completing a $170 grocery order (spent lots of time making lots of deliberate choices), all items suddenly vanished from my cart. The ""best"" response from customer service - after an inaccurate one and a rude, unacceptable one - was that it's a glitch. Well, yes. Obviously. And the app seems unusually glitchy right now. I spend a lot on Amazon. My time is precious. Amazon must do better."
"Personally,based on my experience with this people,I will never order an item through them. None of my items,already payed, arrived to me. No way to speak to somebody of them that can sort out the problem,and the only answer u get is pointing fingers between the Amazon and the seller. If you order something to Amazon,and you pay,u also expect them to do their job properly,not just see them so organized to grab the money,and then what happen after is none of their concerns. Thank you anyway"
"I have one word we can all appreciate 'EASY'. First, the search function quickly discovers my not so clear query with my desired request, which makes the shopping experience a breeze. Second, checkout is a snap! I honesty don't want to use another service. And I don't have to due to the crazy big selection with the best prices around. Truly great experience!"
"Broken, horribly designed and the music downloading process is an experience I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. So where do I start, well, aside from the fact that using this app inexplicably makes my phone hotter than the surface of the sun, I do not understand why every item thumbnail is broken and distorted. Every. Damn. Time. Lastly, if you're trying to entice users into using the services, even to casually download music, then for the love of God don't send them a broken link to do so."
"Amazing online shopping app but I just hated the delayed items. I feel cheated when an item is being delay for a few more days especially when it is a two day shipping item. I do understand that the weather can play a huge role in it but come on. the weather has been nice all week. There are no snow. I'm just probably upset about it, but I will update on my review after more experiences."
"I cannot believe Amazon has such a bad user experience for shopping filters. You can only select one brand,colour etc. Also why can't I filter to exact price range rather than selecting defaults.. Also why the heck is the 'clear all' right above the filter selection as ppl can mistakenly click that. Also the app is not very snappy. Very bad experience overall"
"Brilliant shopping experience but please fix this bug in the app which is really beginning to annoy me: occasionally when you start the app there is a splash screen reminding you about Prime, you tap the acknowledge button and then are left with a blank screen. The solution is to restart the app to be able to do anything.... If the app starts without the splash screen then all is fine..... Grrrr"
"I don't like the new interface or design. It's clunky and no longer intuitive. Also the app is constantly freezing up. Also Amazon's search filters are absolutely useless. All the searches are so full of sponsored items, which don't even fit my search criteria, that it's almost impossible to find anything on Amazon now."
"Very bad experience. I ordered Samsung phone (13000LE), received car key remote, asked for help CS told me that they can't help me. Tried to return it 20 days ago, till now no response. I feel that I bought the tromaie."
"The app is generally fine, but PLEASE FIX NOTIFICATIONS SO THEY MAKE SOUND. Notifications for this app always appear in my ""Silent"" notifications area. I have spent a great deal of time trying to fix this if it has something to do with my device, but after my own experience and the experience of others who have posted about it online, I've come to conclusion that this is the fault of the app developers, either by choice or by error. PLEASE FIX THIS."
"Once I can use the service in my native language (or my Spanish improves) I will be able to review more objectively. But currently, this one simple, fundamental failure cripples user experience for me."
Easy to access! Very user-friendly! Many options to choose from! Great shopping experience!
"Next level 💯 awesome experience, right up there with coffee. If your not doing life with a Prime account your missing out on the best shopping experience money can buy, basically."
No way to return an erroneous delivery. Asking me to troubleshoot a battery when you incorrectly sent diapers!! Unacceptable user experience!
"If I cannot read decent reviews of products, I just won't buy them. If I cannot interact with reviews in English - my preferred language for reading books and also for reviews - I won't make ANY REVIEW. This is such a stupid policy, to stuck you with reviews in a single language. Just because I prefer to buy in BRL doesn't mean I cannot read reviews in English and need some stupid translation I cannot even interact with. Awful experience."
genuinely feel as though this app gets worse every time i open it. absolutely awful experience. its a decent shopping site thats been coated in the worst ui and most bugs i have ever seen.
Amazon can be a horrible experience all around. Never give me your credit card information...With Hulu I'm still trying to get my money back and stop charging me..my credit card company won't do nothing.... Hulu says it's not them... That tells me that they got a thief inside their system. DONT ADD A CREDIT CARD!!!!
My experience with Amazon is good. The only problem I'll have is when Superbowl 58 Feb 11th comes I'm wishing n hoping Amazon Prime Video will broadcast the game for Prime Video Members to watch too. Please n Thank you.
Why is this NOT available on Android tablets. Which are a far better browsing experience. This changed recently & I can't see why. It may explain why Amazon is now my last purchasing option.
"Our experience was great until recently when the Alexa bubble began haunting the sidelines of app screens. And, the scrolling become locked in same products at times, probably to force longer viewing of that venders product. I tried to toggle off as many permissions as I could find related to the Alexa prompt or standby bubble. It is still lurking on screen. I'm quite capable of finding what I need or will use different device."
"Horrible experience with order cancellation. I have been a loyal customer for over 7 years with them, I never witnessed an issue with order like recently. Orders now are either cancelled or take forever and end with cancellation. I lost many opportunities with promotional coupons and no compensation. Customer service getting worse with time as well."
"The Amazon mobile app is extremely slow and often freezes or crashes, especially when organizing and adding items to shopping lists (while searching/browsing items seem to work OK), making an online-shopping experience extremely painful. Also, please stop the auto pop-up of the Whole Foods in-store QR code each and everything I go back to Whole Foods home section. This is so unnecessary, obnoxious/annoying, especially since there's a link to it right there for when it's actually needed. This app is terrible in terms of layout/organization design as well. (This review is for the app only, not about the operations (fulfillment & delivery, which is great.)"
"Great experience, fast delivery, and products are always accurate thus far. I and we love Amazon shopping."
"Great experience, but the busier amazon get, it gets a bit frayed round the edges, they must keep their standards up !!"
"From my experience recently, Amazon is allowing companies to sell products with misleading shipping information on their website. I'm now skeptical about spending money on Amazon."
The Q and A section no longer appears. Makes the whole shopping experience useless. Can not get information on what you want to buy anymore.
"Paying for prime went from 2 Day shipping to deliveries from usps, similar to wish, that's accompanied by an increase to the monthly rate and decrease to the quality of your entire experience. The workers are over worked and under paid. All in all a horrible American version of a Chinese sweat shop, dumpster fire. Atleast I finially got that bumper sticker with ""sasquatch and an alien flipping a bird"" on it 13 days late."
"The service has been good for all my shopping experience, especially with updates about deliveries on delivering on time...."
"App is super buggy. Have to hit ""add to list"" literally 20+ times to add an item to a wish list but of course ""add to cart"" works just fine. Constantly get ""uh oh, something went wrong"" and have to search again. Looking for help redirects you to a forum with no answers or recourse. Terrible experience from such a large company, especially since I pay for Prime. To many permissions! Amazon has no business knowing who I call or text! Uninstalling this data mining app because it doesn't even do what it's supposed to."
"I like the app in general. But once a week it switches the interface language from English to Spanish. And it takes me quite some time to switch it back, because I don't know Spanish at all. It ales lady happened about 20-30 times and it becomes very annoying. Please fix it. Good app otherwise. Thanks."
Amazon has provided me wonderful experience for the past one year. Products are fairly priced and delivery is on time.
My experience at Amazon has been amazing I love shopping at Amazon because it saves me a lot of time so I don't have to worry about going out and getting the things I need I recommend this app
Always a great return experience. Just read your reviews before any purchases and for the most part Amazon has everything you may need.
Hello everyone I want to tell you my experience. I ordered iphone 15 pro blue platinum on January 4 from Amazon seller also Amazon. But I received a green soap. And I complaint about that I send them picture and all. And I review about my experience. You know what they did ? They block my account and they're saying that they send original I phone in that box that they confirmed. How come? Please please don't vaiste your time if you need something expensive product go directly any store and buy.
"Had the worst and most terrible experience, item arrived late, even after talking to support team multiple times and telling me I would get the item in time. I even explained to them that if the item does not come in time please do not send it at all because Iwas going to leave the country. But the item did not arrive and I left the country, although I still was not able to cancel the order. It took me multiple times to contact them again to get a refund and it was so so stressful."
"The update is terrible. Had never had any issues before, and enjoyed the shopping experience. However since the update, it crashes regularly, disconnects from the internet, loses my searches, and most irritatingly: rarely loads my account. I'm left unable to check on order updates and delivery times. Absolutely awful."
"Who on earth thought it would be a good idea to move the search bar to the bottom of the app? If something works good, just leave it alone. I am highly annoyed by the change, and it's ruining my shopping experience. Just opening the app now, and seeing the search bar at the bottom of the screen is pissing me off. It's completely non intuitive. Please just put the search bar back where it was so I can actually enjoy shopping again."
"I've been trying to contact amazon due to a problem we're having with the app and our prime account but there's no way to have a one-on-one chat help. Everything there is are preanswered questions (none that helps our problem). The ""chat"" help doesn't let me type just give me options to explain my problem and none of them help. It's frustrating and my shopping experience is horrible. We ordered a lot from amazon but now we don't see the products as we should so we can't place orders anymore."
"I HATE that the new update took the pages away from search results! Replacing them with ""load more."" The pages made it easy to go back to an item I was interested in and choose after shopping the other pages. Its like they took the shelf away at the store and now are the products are a mixed up mess on the aisle. This will ABSOLUTELY DETER ME FROM shopping with this app(which is 99% of my amazon shopping experience). Hope you change it back soon!!"
"I have been obsessed with Amazon since I discovered it and have never had any issues with the app, until the latest update, but now I can't stand it. I uninstalled the update to find that the app is not supported without it. I have to close the app due to constantly glitching and freezes while trying to select items, it really makes my shopping experience unpleasant. Probably won't be purchasing anything until fixed, or a new update is available. Sad."
"I regularly use amazon, have prime and generally have a good experience but WHY OH WHY have you now got search results in 2 columns with huge item images!! Now I can't conveniently scroll down through a list of results I have scroll to the side to see what I'm missing and because of the huge images I'm sure it displays less results per page! Bring back the convenient list with thumbnails!"
"Amazon shopping experience in general is great. Doing online groceries on Amazon using this app is a hassle. First, there is no search bar dedicated for Amazon Fresh or Whole Foods and searching will constantly take you away from the grocery store and show products on Amazon in general. Second, there is no way to know the delivery availability until you go to check out (This could be fixed with an on-screen message displaying the next available delivery time) while adding groceries to the cart."
"New user interface is horrible! Had to Uninstall multiple times and still doesn't work. Keeps glitching. If someone sends me a link, it opens in my app but keeps glitching and won't let anything happen. Why change something that works!! Also, everything is GIANT now. Words and images!!"
"Used to be a great app to use...NOW... The new interface SUCKS!!! When I went to look up an archived order from 2020 it only came up with something I regularly order. And its real slow to load after this update. I am tempted to uninstall and just use the website, unless that has also been updated to something that don't work worth a damn. If that's the case then I'll probably drop Prime and go somewhere else."
"User experience much worse Before you could quickly go to orders to see their status, now you have to click your profile, then click orders and then it just refreshes randomly... Then you have to click more, search for your product and then view the order. And not all orders have the return button, you have to go to customer service to return an item. It's like they deliberately made it harder to return items in the hope users will give up"
"It's do easy, practical and fast, that is easy to get addicted. Caveat Emptor. Mr. Besos is a visionary man, he visualize that simplifying the buying process, offering topof the line and effortless return policy, combined with fast delivery would lead him to become the richest man on earth. He made a great shopping experience, easy for everyone, on the phone, on the computer, and continues to innovate."
"Nice shopping experience, although I hate that when you try and search for sexual adult products through the application, it only shows a few items, even if you try to refresh it. You guys need to fix this, so that sexual products can be browsed with ease. I dont know if you guys hide the search from the app,but you need to fix this issue #Amazon."
"there deliveries are super inconsistent, even when I'm paying almost $200 a year. I just started ordering food thinking that It would be a better experience... I was very wrong. not sure how they do things but if a driver is delivering food, they should be able to contact the customer and ARIVE ON TIME! the guy called once before he figured I wouldn't be there and just left the food on another porch for the delivery. very bad customer service did t even offer a solution.never using Amazon again"
"I had had the worst delivery experiences ever since I came to UAE. Not once, but three times. Yesterday, I had a delivery of a simple phone case. I wanted to make sure it was original. The delivery guy called just 5 minutes prior to the delivery and I was outside and the time period was impossible. He was adamant that he won't be returning for the day, if I miss it, and left it with the security. Turned out the case is a fake. Now I have to return it. No way to rate the delivery experience."
"My experience is based more on Amazon services. I'm a first time user of this app and service and my experience has been the worst. I sent an expensive order through just to be told that I didn't pay enough and certain items wasn't available. How do you steal people money then say....oh, you need to add more. I don't play when it comes to my hard earned money and they could at least have the decency to return the funds for items you don't receive. This is extremely poor customer service."
"Honestly one of the worst companies I've ordered from. The customer service just is awful. I ordered from them and paid for prime shipping and my items are still arriving 2 days late. I never would have paid for shipping and just done the free option if I had known it was going to be such an unpleasant experience. On top of that, all my stress and worry along with such a disappointing service from such a big company the most they could do was give me a 10 dollar store credit for $300 worth."
"The prior style and user interface of the Amazon App was perfectly fine. And now that everyone has been using that for many years, Amazon decides to revamp it with something that is really not user-friendly, and has bugs. Not happy at all. Amazon just wasted a lot of money fixing something that wasn't broken, and messing it up!"
The App itself isn't too bad ...but customer service needs alot of work ! Amazon customer service will not work with you ... terrible experience with membership renewal ! Longtime customer but after this last experience I will be cancelling my membership !!! A complete rip off with Prime ! Better off shopping with Walmart & other businesses direct & it's free most of the time !!
"It WAS fine. Now this app is so slow that on 4G it refuses to load and on WiFi it's still takes a long time to find results. On top of all this, the original interface was perfectly fine. Easy to navigate and boxes to click on where I expected them to be. Now I don't know where anything is and aren't able to load any pages to find out. Update: after clearing app cache and storage and then removing the app and redownloading. Works fine on 4G now. Will update stars to 3."
Terrible interface. I have a much better experience just using the website in my browser in desktop mode. It's waaaaay too zoomed in. No view options at all. Terrible in landscape mode. Littered with multiple sticky bars at top and bottom that take up screen space. Sticky bars are ALWAYS BAD. They are pure garbage and so is anyone that implements them in an app or website. At least give us some options to turn your stupid garbage off.
"Very annoying nowadays. App opens fine but if I have to access my account page, or anything two or more levels down in the navigation, the app just keeps circling and it routes back me to the main page. Lately. Amazon app is not living up to standards. Very subpar app experience, something you see in a tiny company with primitive developers. Amazon needs to keep up its game."
"The new update doesn't seem to help user with experience. It's more like a treasure hunt to find what he's looking for. A hint screen or something could've helped with users to familiarize themselves with the UI, helps when you go with a huge UI revamp. More over the padding on the left in my accounts page is horrible."
"Glitchy update. Scrolling limit is a joke. Clicking a next button after seeing a handful of items is time consuming and kills the shopping experience. Putting sponsored items ahead of well reviewed or high quality items is shady. What does sponsored even mean, except that some company paid a premium to be #1. The App also crashes everytime I open it now. This is the worst update ever. Wish I could go back to the original. I buy a lot on Amazon. This seems like a leap backwards in App quality."
"Poorest customer experience I have ever experienced. Delivered to wrong address and I had to find the address that it was delivered to, and that was based off of a picture of the ""delivered"" goods. Customer service wouldn't offer any sort of compensation for the inconvenience of searching for my package. And thank the stars that the person which whom it was delivered, was nice and gave it back. Horrible, horrible service. My prime account has been canceled. Bad service altogether."
Did give 5 star however I'm having problems since update. Everything is zoomed in a lot. Then when I try to view an item it just flickers on and off. Completely unusable when clicking on an item. Can't order anything since subscribed to prime. What...I pay to receive a worse experience?? If this is not fixed I will unsubscribe and uninstall.
"The Amazon shopping app for the most part has a smooth, sublime operational niche that most other shopping Apps don't have! It is certainly in the top of the list of all good shopping Apps. However it is not the best or best of the best but well on its way to one of those levels. I've experienced some frustrations with but for the most part my use of the app has been pleasurable,pleasing,pleasant and supreme. I despite it's faults I'd recommend it to the top 1% of the wealthy. Thumbs up! Way up."
"Went short on money and had to cancel an order. But surprise surprise it refuses to do so ! The item is nowhere near being shipped and I have access to the cancellation option. But when I select the order and press cancel , it acts like I haven't selected any orders ! Tried to search about it and nothing comes up. When I log in into my account on the direct website and not the app , it says I have no orders ! A very much unpleasant experience for now."
"They moved the ""your orders"" button and ""your account"" button to the bottom of the page, creates a completely jarring experience. Then when navigating it returns to the top of the page. Makes the whole app more difficult to use. Please put it back or give people the option to toggle it where they like."
"The app really leaves something to be desired, especially for an app created for one of the single most widely used online shopping outlets of all time. You'd think they could afford software engineers who were capable of building a user friendly and at least decently seamless mobile shopping experience. It's buggy and laggy and you can neither manage your prime subscription nor use many seller functions. It's just not a great app."
"I don't normally write reviews, but this new interface is the worst! Hit the back button? Exits the app. Search for a few minutes? Might as well restart the app to get to your lists, cart, etc. A real pain to deal with. I don't like Amazon shopping anymore."
"not sure what is going on with amazon lately. I have been a member for a long time. I used to not bother giving any review because I did not have the time but I started buying more online since the pandemic started and in a way I relied on reviews to at least decide whether to purchase a product or not. In return, I placed my review/experience using the product to help others as well in deciding. But it seems the app has a glitch and kept deleting or not posting reviews, it keeps freezing too."
"Major user interface issues. Swiping/scrolling on an Android phone is still problematic; the app detects almost any touch as a tap, so it ends up opening random items. When opening an item from another app (Google) the back button should take you back to Google; instead, as soon as you go into the Amazon app, you're ""stuck"" in it; hitting back brings you to wherever you left off last time you were in the Amazon app. Search field is quirky; you can't change the text in it, you always start over."
"Amazon customer service agents should be trained to deal with customer expectations and customer experience throughout the shipping process, especially when they are paying for prime benefits."
My own shopping experience with Amazon App I Rated 5 because Amazon have delivered all of my purchases with no problems. They stand by their help and follow through with good Customer Service. They make my shopping online easy with care compared to some others that I have experienced. I love the variety of good products selections; and gifts for all occasions and ages. I rate the Delivery Department a 5 for Excellent Service. All in all I love shopping online with Amazon ☆☆☆☆☆.
"I have been trying for about a year to uninstall the Amazon app from my phone, and despite my efforts to communicate with Amazon, I have been unable to do so. This lack of control over the apps on my own device is extremely frustrating and infringes upon my freedom. Amazon, your app is by far the worst and most intrusive I have ever experienced. Allowing users to easily uninstall your app should be a basic freedom. Your decision to force its permanence on our devices is unacceptable I'm Pissed"
"Slow app, lots of bugs. Every product page takes forever to load images. The buttons are all very laggy. When I press add to cart, it takes sometimes more than 10 seconds to respond. Tried to check out today, and the 'Proceed to Cart' button was just stuck on a loop that kept taking me back to the same page. Going to try the mobile web version to checkout and if that fails maybe my laptop. Bad experience with this app."
"New update would truncate the user experience in the gui. Amazon must love hiding functionality. No thanks I'll pass for now. And about the kindle books- Thanks to google and amazon I now buy paper books! I don't deal with the website in a standard browser anymore, and I certainly don't like dealing with book lists to purchase."
"Amazon itself is a really good place to order products especially when you need them as soon as possible, the app is nice, after my order didn't arrive or got delayed, I couldn't start a refund through the app, you have to login through a computer or to chat with customer support, it took them 2-3 minutes to issue a replacement or a refund for me because the package was lost. Really good experience."
"A ""Middle of the Shopping Aisle"" App, at best. I've experienced positive and negative sessions with Amazon Shopping over the past two years. However, the sudden inability to open over other apps when used to open a link, the constant background refreshing, and the terrible drain on my mobile's battery are proving to be deal breakers. Hopefully, Amazon will eventually tinker towards producing a more User (and Mobile) Friendly experience. But, until then I must say goodbye and good luck, my dears!"
"The app itself works fine, however the shopping experience can range from great to absolutely horrendous. On my last purchase Amazon lost my order, al9ng with many other issues and I was promised a refund as compensation, to match the price of my initial purchase. I was, however, scammed out of $300 despite several associates reassuring me the offered compensation would be honored. Overall terrible customer service."
"Constant crashing. They also made the return process more difficult with their automated questionnaire. If I want to return it, I want to return it. Not troubleshoot the item and be constantly redirected. Just give me my money. Half tempted to cancel prime. Amazon is no longer the convenient shopping experience it used to be. Just a glorified temu or wish."
Just like many other reviewers said its annoying to search for items. The pictures are far too big like a desktop version. Horrible experience on mobile. Items searched for also often come up with the wrong items. Pretty aggravating especially when there is tons of sponsored items that are nowhere near the items thats were searched for.
"Agonizingly slow at most times! Constant Alexa request to use is so annoying. Most annoying is the fact that the Alexa symbol is permanently affixed, I imagine strategically, so that every time you touch it by accident, it requests that you use Alexa. I do not w This is a real annoyance! I order several times a month with Fresh, it is always a painful experience. Search is extremely slow and and when you search a specific item/category, you might get a list of items including non-related items."
"Issues with last two updates: Interface is now optimised for oversized screens, so on normal smart phones (not compact sized, just normal) more of the screen is wasted to oversized icons. Some of the icons don't even show up, not sure why. For example I have no idea what stars I'm giving when reviewing products, because the stars are not visible. They are there and clickable, but not visible. Other, similar functional issues. Devs: Please give us a setting where we can revert to older UI."
Idk what they are doing with this app but it's starting to go downhill. The long press the heart 🤍 to save a favorite to a list doesn't work anymore. Attempted to share a link though Gmail and Amazon didn't even have a proper active link attached. It was just the product title and an inactive link. Stop trying to fix things that aren't broken cause the app interface is terrible now.
Adding a search function to my selected text options is not okay. Ruins my mobile phone experience.
"Amazon offers a great service. That is until you have to deal with their awful carrier service, which is usually a 50/50 on whether you'll get the package. From my most recent experience the carrier blatantly lied about making the delivery on two separate occasions and as of writing this review my package is lost with a replacement arriving next week, over 10 days from when I was meant to receive the package (And yes, I have prime). So, if an item is being delivered by amzl, dont bother."
"Gives a slightly more mobile-optimized shopping experience than the website. However, last week it began pushing deceptive ads as alert messages on my phone. The ads indicate that I have an update waiting for the Amazon App Store, which I don't have. This ad would convince most readers that by tapping the ad, they will be updating an installed app instead of installing a new app. Amazon: Advertise if you must. But, at least be truthful about it. **Messages blocked**"
"I only have a string of 4 letter words to describe my experience with this. First off, I was forced to download, then after several tries, 7 to 10 minutes each, I just canceled out. HEY AMAZON!!! EVER HEARD, IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT. Now I mainly use my desktop to access Amazon as this app continues to try to force me to update."
"Very nice experience, but a laptop for this kind of shopping is clearly superior. The app is nice for a quick item or two and great for music and movies, but if you're planning on a deep dive or any real heavy lifting on the aite, you're better off with a device with a bigger screen. Scrolling just isn't going to cut it. Nice for a quick purchase that comes to mind! Mind your data limits!"
I have loved the interface up until the latest update. It looks like they've reverted to a beta format that has been dumbed down to the point of unusability. It's disappointing and counterintuitive to use now. I need to find a way to roll back the previous version or use the mobile site in lieu of the app. This interface is embarrassing.
"Must say amazon has been sucking for a long time now. It's become impossible to find anything, the search features and product pages have been corrupted by the drive to advertise they waste much time of the user and obfuscate information users need to make informed efficient decisions. Not a pleasant shopping experience anymore... feels like advertising hell... moving on to alternatives. All I want to see is ""adjustable dumbells"", not 467 results of nonsense to sift thru."
Can't stand the message centre. Overall shopping experience is great until you have to return setting and you can't send the seller an image fe to go with your case. I'm not someone who uses a PC or a laptop and I do all work from my phone but it's annoying that I cannot properly send messages to sellers as it comes up with crappy context.
The experience of Amazon is Stupendous and absolutely 💯% Lovely! As long as the driver who delivers the packages is courteous!!
"Amazon experience is quick and easy, and the app is handy. However each time I open the app it keeps telling me the version of the app is no longer supported and I have to update, which brings me here and it's already the latest version. Although only a minor inconvenience, its just frustrating."
"I've had a lot of positive experiences with Amazon but the bad experiences outweigh. I never received a package and hundreds of messages back and forth and hours on the phone with various customer service nothing was ever handled. For months I was strung along waiting for call backs and ""investigations."" Customer service was always sympathetic but never actually did anything. I sat on the phone with someone for 3 hours only for them to tell me they'd get it worked out and nothing."
"This is the most bullcrap thing I have experienced, I have ordered multiple things and quite a few items have just disappeared, not to mention the entire cart just disappeared as well. When I ordered the things that didn't show up, it said the order was on hold but showed up normally but when clicked on it deleted. I honestly think this is a code run by a middle schooler, Everyone reading the reviews boycott it, and just go buy your things at other websites and stores. This is a complete waist."
"Awful since the update, menu looks clunky and all over the place and i literally cannot look at items in any of my wish lists, it just sends me back to the homes screen, so i cant even make purchases. Massive own goal, revert to the old interface, i dont care who thinks it looks good or whatever corporate tosh they will spout, it doesnt work and your customers dont like it and cant even make purchases, quite a problem for you lot. Fix it sharpish or i will be forced to take my custom elsewhere"
"Not a fan of this update. The new interface sucks. Ever heard of the phrase ""if it isn't broken don't fix it"" ? Well that's what they did here. Unfortunately as the only superstore online and no real competition I'll continue using them but I just wanted to note my disdain for the new layout. Note I don't leave reviews often for anything especially apps so hopefully that helps to empathize my disdain for the updated app. Edit 8-2-2021 and again the new app update is a doubling down on above."
"The Amazon service is good, but the app experience is cumbersome and irritating. The filter menu is slow to load and closes each time you select or deselect an item, so selecting multiple filters is painfully time-consuming. The item size and color screens are extremely slow to load. I frequently get kicked to my phone's lock screen when browsing."
The newest update for android is awful. It's very slow to load photos half the time other times information is missing from the page. Like I cannot see reviews for an item. Very sluggish now. It was perfect before the update. I've been shopping with Amazon for 20 years. This is my first negative experience.
"I think Amazon shopping is the absolute best of all the online shopping. I personally like to only shop Amazon. The shopping, especially if you join Prime( which has lots of other benefits other than shopping) Shipping is free, Amazon fresh has great produce, as well as meat,eggs etc. Never had an issue customer service didn't handle quickly, no Hassel. There is even a try on and pay only if you keep it..what other app does that!!! So, go for the experience, door to door delivery & stay."
"Product ads have gotten so bad in the app that finding what I'm actually trying to buy is almost impossible. I've found myself going into actual stores lately to find name brand products. Three or four years ago, Amazon's shopping experience was awesome. Now it's unbearable. I WILL look elsewhere for products before Amazon now."
"I haven't experienced any issues/changes regarding adding things to various lists (which I have a lot of). The link is easy to overlook though. My huge issue for the past couple months is suddenly now you can't go to another user's profile, browse their reviews, and actually know what product the review is for. There's no link to the product or name/title of product to go with the reviews. Super upsetting since browsing users reviews is a fav way to discover new stuff based off reviewers style"
"I use the app the whole time, but the latest update shows only 10 search results, meaning that I have to click and then wait for the next 10 to appear - and go back if I want to see earlier results. Amazon, you are not that amazing at finding what I am looking for, don't make the experience even poorer! Update Now, if I go away then back to the app, it doesn't show me the product I was looking at and when I find the product again, it's more expensive than it was seconds before!"
"Amazon is my best friend! I rarely have to go into a shopping mall. Talk about convenience, they are #1 hands down in my book both personally and professionally. If there is an issue they are fast to correct it. They even give replacements before you have to send the damaged or faulty products back. My experience with Amazon has been great!"
"Having a great experience shopping at Amazon !!! It's fast shipping, most of the items I had come was packed really well, I've had bad experience with the cleaning liquid, most of it has leaked out, hating to sending it back, I put up with the loss of the cleaning liquid, but overall it's been awesome waiting on my 📦...Thank you Amazon for making my shopping much easier and affordable!!!!"
"I appreciate the ease of shopping on Amazon when I do not feel like shopping till I drop, lol. I enjoy Amazon Prime and I really appreciate that whenever I have had issues, and sellers would not respond to my emails(only happened a few times) an Amazon rep would always step in and rectify the situation. Some items are definitely knock offs, when it comes to clothes and shoe shopping, but overall, I am pleased with my shopping experience."
"My recent experience using the app has been of an annoyance! I did a search on an item and 1/5th of the search results were sponsored unrelated (never did a search on any of those items) ad items! As for delivery of items, I've ordered enough to qualify for the free shipping, why would it take a few days to actually ship the items (order status shows items have not yet been shipped)? Because of this, I started doing most of my shopping on others sites like Ebay!"
Amazon can be great. I had a few bad experiences. Items didn't show up and they refused to refund my money. I have to say be on top of your orders and make sure you carry door ring app and make sure they take photo of drop area. Otherwise 60% my item amazing other disappointed. Amazon should do investigate on all providers that are using them. I go through Amazon and I expect the up most best. Money doesn't grow on trees.
"Worst buying experience, getting blocked again and again, for this reason losing reservation on items with low stock. Tried 3 different payments and none of them worked, called my bank and the issue was not on their side, payment had issues on Amazon side, contacted support twice and got bored after being unable to unlock the account. Big middle finger to amazon"
A Huge downfall for me is when they send me a product I order and it's not the one I ordered and it costs me money to send it back to them (whether it's gas or packaging) When it's their error! And you don't get credited or anything for their mistake! On top of that I pay for prime! And now I have to wait even longer for the product! The rest of my experience has been ok except when I've ordered expensive products and the delivery driver leaves it at the end of my driveway on the damn ground!
"Amazon is the absolute worst. Most recent experience, the delivery for items ordered was delayed, then the items were canceled after the rep stated they would be delivered next day. Cs was extremely rude when I contacted them again regarding this issue and said my refund was processing. I wanted the items, didn't ask for order to be canceled nor a refund. Do better Amazon. And I will NEVER make the mistake of shopping with you again."
"I was a loyal Prime member for years. I loathe using the Amazon app anymore. They constantly change the interface and move features around making it harder to use than it should be. I have several Kindles and managing the content is problematic with the constant updates and moving of features. In the end, between the app changes, steady increase in Prime membership and sloppy Amazon delivery, I am no longer a Prime member,nor do I allow my Amazon shopping app to auto update."
"Horrible experience! Had to cancel my order because Amazon kept ""suggesting"" 2 day shipping and split my order up into 2 different orders so, I'm paying for 2 day shipping twice. Upon canceling my order, the gift card I used transferred to my balance. I decided to try again and just pay for shipping (without adding my credit card information) and added an additional $16 to my balance to complete the purchase. Immediately after loading the money my account locked for ""suspicious activity"""
"Amazon has good Products, and the secure online shopping experience is the perfect way to find out what you need."
"The latest update, almost unusable. The app is slow laggy when ever a ""sponsored"" item with the larger video ad basically makes the app stop working. Defeats the purpose of the app, can't even browse the items without the app shuttering and I have to restart app and start my search over. I've uninstalledand reinstalled still horrible experience. Fix your app amazon."
The new interface good looking just missed the old layout it was easier to manage stuff this one just causes confusion as everyone button has been rearranged so it a tad of struggle looking for stuff wish it was reverted to the old layout but kept the new interface. Furthermore when you scroll down your long list of save for later wish it didn't go all the way to the beginning wish it would continue were you left off
"I mean who doesn't love Amazon. I think it's become apart of everyone's life. If you have never ordered from Amazon, then you must live under a rock. haha This Amazon shopping app just makes shopping with Amazon that much quicker and easier. Get your account info, payment info, purchase history and so much more all in one place. I've been using this Amazon shopping app for a long time and I've never experienced any problems of any kind with it. If you're not using this app, then you should."
"since update everyrhing on the interface has changed, did you think it would be funny to change the look and functionality of it backwards? Who asked you to switch it, did I? Certainly not! These things should be options not forced requirements. Also since you switched my interface from left top to bottom left the functionality of the options bar is so slow as to be virtually non functional.////No Thank You!!!/ Ps. Also no way to uninstall update Am not a fan!"
Easy enough to use but the most recent updates are AWFUL. The old interface looked nicer and was much easier to navigate. Also I don't know when they did it but they took away the ability to report sellers or listings which is absolutely ridiculous. I'm sure people abused the system but I'd rather them have to go through reports than for it to be impossible to find legitimate listings with real reviews. There are sooo many sketchy Chinese sellers and scammers taking over Amazon.
"I've been ordering off of Amazon for a few years now and I've got to say that it is an amazing experience. I honestly can't wait for the text message with the little photo of my package delivered, its honestly like a mini Christmas feeling, hahaha. I've had a few problems here and there and customer service was great; albeit it took some time, but none the less all problems solved."
"NEVER AGAIN, TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE I'm very disappointed with Amazon service as they took my payment for the order and put the order on hold after that due to their internal checks. So they're asking about my personal details, my cards, etc. All security checks should be done before payment, not after! And that's very weird to suspect a person just for a shopping. You should deliver goods and trust you consumers. If you dont want to serve me - just return my money and good bye!"
"always works, love the lists, Prime two day shipping essential, return policy makes for a happy experience. loads fast, page is usually easy to navigate. love the prpduct compairsons, when all the info is there. Need to use larger type font and never use gray for font, cant read it. I never buy online of anyone else, just not safe nor as easy."
"I love shopping and Amazon definitely makes it much easier. 98.5% of the time I find exactly what I'm looking for and shipping is also timely. I really appreciate that they have so many tools for you to ensure that the item you want is really what your looking for. My favorite part are the reviews, where buyers can express with honesty details about their experience with items quality, functionality, longevity etc. I spend hours searching and saving items for when I'm ready to buy. It's awesom"
"Review is based more on Amazon shopping experience then the app itself. After multiple items showing up not as described or packages being stolen, drivers inconsistent to where they deliver packages (unit door or lobby). I found the shopping experience terrible. I was a prime member and even priority shipping was delayed on multiple occasions. Why pay for prime? The app itself is hard to navigate, and deal alert notifications when clicked take you nowhere, why have them?"
"Not a pleasant shopping experience. The new layout in this App is really frustrating and riddled with Bugs. Hopefully the update will fix them, as for the layout, I will just have to live with it. Update: This App is still full of bugs and far from usable. I am forced to return to placing orders from a Browser. If the next update fails to amend the miskes in the code, I will be permanently deleting this App."
"Lacks essential features the web interface provides. Amazon's web site allows one to search all reviews of a product for specific words or phrases, such as searching for the words ""smell"" or ""odor"" or ""burning rubber"" when researching a product which might or might not set off my allergies. This app does not allow one to do these kinds of searches. It also appears to load Amazon product pages slower than Chrome."
"They moved the search bar to the bottom of the app & the top search results still appear top to bottom and it is so infuriating that it destroys the entire user experience for me. I am also not alone in this & every review I've seen since the update shares the same sentiment. I was told it was a test & would revert back in 48 hours, but several days later it remains the same. The only workaround I've figured out is to uninstall and reinstall the app & it reverts back to the top temporarily."
"Used to be great. Redesign appears to be an exercise in style over function. Slow, badly designed interface has broken the previous effective navigation. Not sure who tested this but they need another go. Oh and the new logo for notifications is too easy to miss when scrolling through a list."
"It's not bad, for a rich company could be more. Can't shop w/a migraine, *PLS* make Dark Mode, not invert. It'd be cool to search in all lists vs. 1 list. Wish you could leave comments. You could make it short + block a lot of words, or maybe auto responses like, ""Thank you"", ""I agree"", ""My experience was different"", ""I contacted & no one helped"", ""I contacted support & got help"", ""I was contacted wks later"", ""I was contacted mo later"" for quick overview. I like thanking ppl, encourage reviews."
"For my first thing I bought I was told that it arrived at August 14, checked and it wasn't there. I checked for about a week and it never arrived, told an expert and they said that it was scanned wrong and it would arrive in 1-2 business days, checked in every day for around a week again, wasn't there. Talked with a expert again, and they just gave me a refund and considered it lost. For my first product on Amazon I had a terrible experience. The only good thing about that were the experts."
"Giving 3 stars for current app glitches and shipping errors experienced in the last few weeks. App freezes constantly, Samsung Note10+ repeatedly prompts me to WAIT/CLOSE APP in after each 2 seconds of scrolling. Shipping errors & non-deliveries are occuring more often. I moved from the country to downtown city and suddenly my packages are being lost, never received, routed to other cities after arriving in my city's post office then sent elsewhere. I hold Amazon for this error."
"Ordering groceries is so confusing and annoying now. Earlier it was only Amazon Pantry. Now there is pantry, then fresh, then prime and then the normal amazon sellers. This is so confusing and annoying. None of these options can fulfill one's monthly grocery necessities. So one has to hop around these multiple options to buy groceries. This is ridiculous to do grocery shoping which is a mundane task! Can amazon please improve this experience and limit to one unified experience please???"
App used to always work well but recently it feels almost broken. Changing sizes of clothing garments practically freezes the app and the whole thing becomes unresponsive until the app seems to eventually catch up with one's inputs. A very unpleasant shopping experience and I had to uninstall for the first time ever.
"I think the user experience with this app is a downgrade from using my smartphone's browser. I hate that when I go to Amazon in my browser it forces me over to this app. I hate that in order to use Amazon support chat I have to install the app. Also I think the interface color is ugly. You might like it. It's almost turquoise, but not quite. And ugh! Unrequested notifications about products I ""might like"" Just no!"
"Previous version was flawless, never had any bugs, glitches or problems. Now with the latest update my god its terrible! The prime button is in an awkward position & after searching the app deosnt quite settle quick enough so when you tap search you end up tapping address, it just ruins shopping experience. The WORSE thing by far since this update is when your browsing multiple products & you press back to come out of one product it freezes unless you keep tapping back several times crashing"
"I don't buy through Amazon. I prefer a more personal ordering experience. And Amazon should not store all my credit cards and have a very difficult 'delete my account' link and Amazon told me they just follow me from bank to bank if I change banks. Plus, we're going to lose our country unless we stop importing. That will put a damper on Covid spread also. I buy US goods, services. You asked."
"Unable to see the stores I follow on my profile. I have tried on my phone & kindle apps plus my laptop with no luck. I follow people for a reason - so I don't have to constantly go searching for their store. Please correct this feature!! I also recently experienced a random $1.93 charge on my card that I did not make causing me to have to remove my card, have it cancelled and a new one issued. It seems this is a problem recently for a lot of people (having random charges they didn't make)."
"I've been a Prime member and app user for many years. Amazon simply gives the best consumer experience ever. They've raised the bar a mile above all competition. I love the product reviews. I love tracking a product leaving California one day and somehow getting delivered to me the next in Michigan. This company has completely spoiled us. And despite the bad ""big company"" box others love to put them in, they've done it on the smallest profit margins possible. They give the consumer pure value!"
"Terrible experience using this app. It freezes, doesn't let me scroll through my wishlist, and when I try to look at my orders all it does is flash so I can't see what's happening with my orders! If it doesn't get fixed soon I will not be shopping on Amazon anymore! Clearing cache or force stopping the app DOES NOT WORK!"
"Amazon repeatedly loses my packages and makes me wait at least 2 days past the supposed ""product delivered"" status before they will process any refund or replacement. Prime has been a complete waste of money and negative experience for me. I've spent hours on the phone trying to ensure my address is correct and they have the location updated, yet they show utter incompetence in their deliveries."
"Such a horrible app to operate. Bad interface and the app looks like it was made by a 10 year old. It also doesn't show all click and collect locations, and doesn't show all search results either. I always have to use the website to see all results, so it is pretty pointless having this app."
"Great easy shopping experience, something for everyone's price budget fast efficient delivery a win win 😀"
Make shopping easy as well as finding good deals. With prime free shipping or free shipping over a certain dollar amount. You can make different lists. Compare similar items how are you guys doing so you know which deal is the best. As well as the seller and their reputation. With my experience anytime there has been an issue it is been corrected and resolved in a timely fashion to my satisfaction. I highly recommend this app
"For the most part I've had good experiences with Amazon. Now & then I get something that's not as discribed. I miss the one day delivery, but maybe that shouldn't have been that way. I've read some negative ads about some parts of Amazon. I hope thing's get better in all of their locations."
"They make their user interface confusing in order to rip you off. It automatically selects a prime free trial everytime you try to purchase something and if you don't manually change that it will sign you up for prime and charge you the next month. Also, I went to return a $150 item and they conveniently hid that I needed to MANUALLY change my refund method to my card or it gives you a gift card. You don't know about these dumb systems until you've fallen for it once. Never using amazon again :)"
"Awful, I suspect the amazon purchasing has been hacked. In my past experience with Amazon I have purchased an item and they have automatically taken the money out of my account, now they are saying that they don't charge the account until the day that it is shipped. This is the second time this has happened to me and I have never experienced this when purchasing items before. It posted on my bank, now its dissapeared and im out X amount of money. Christmas is coming, now what am I going to do."
"An app which is infested with the usual anti-consumer policies of most major companies, making the whole experience an unpleasant chore. They have now introduced large, unstoppable video ads throughout the app. 'Sponsored' results infest every search. Sorting wishlists by 'price drops' has been removed also. All searches now ask you to 'load more' rather than just displaying results. I've now uninstalled it and will just use the desktop site adblocked."
"App is barely better than web experience, but it has good notifications. Only funny thing is that it was crashing due to web view, which is technically system software and it was then inviting one to remove updates to system software. That's kinda crazy to me Amazon. Guess you don't think that much about your customers and just fix your problems."
"transitioning from the Souq app has been the worst experience. Such a step down in quality. I've lost all my wish lists, filtering options are worse (can't specify exact price range, limited number of brands in the filter), and the overall interface not what I would have expected from Amazon. Very disappointing."
"No doubt, I love shopping with Amazon. Great products, some at ridiculously low prices, jewelry is a great example. Refunds are super easy, but usually refunds were something I failed to get right, clothes size.for example. My experience with delivery has always been that the packages arrived earlier than expected."
"Absolutely terrible experience as always with Amazon. Literally deleted my old card's, put my new one, tried to charge something to it. It went through. BUT IT DIDN'T SAY IT DIDN'T GO THROUGH ON MY WIFES CARD INSTEAD OF MINE AFTER DECLINING!! Have had issues with drivers that I've reported as well. Uninstall this app, I am after I get my package if it ever arrives. Edit: it also removes my card, and says it invalid. The card is a little over 2 months old and have used for plenty of other things"
"There is one issue that ruins the whole experience. When clicking on a Google search result that is an english Amazon Listing, the app automatically changes (updates) my language preference from German to English. I had to change it a few dozen times back to German. Also, I am getting these annoying emails when the language changes. Please let the user choose that it would stay that language and never update anything."
"Worst shopping app around, hands down. Unbelievably slow, terrible user interface compared to its competitors, terrible search algorithm and filter system, and full of sponsored garbage that clogs the screen. None of this is to mention how bad Amazon's prices have become in recent years. 99% of their stock can be purchased from ebay for much less money, or for a similar price with none of the headaches of navigating this garbage app. How can a multi-billion dollar company have the worst app?"
"It is a mess. It is way more complicated than the website. Because I was trying to figure out how it works the checkout, I lost a flash deal. It seems you have 15min to proceed with the checkout before the deal expires. My first time dealing with prime day, the app and the flash deals. Overall it was a horrible experience. Better buy from others instead from Amazon."
"Never will I ever shop or deal with amazon again. I try to login to my account and get some bogus message about a notification bc of ""security process"" it never sends the notification I call customer service to resolve the issue provide all my info and they still refuse to unlock my account bc I have to do it through that message. Their service is by far the worse I've ever experienced!!!!! Only reason they got 1 star from me is bc I had to select at least one to write this review!!"
"Very easy to shop and access menus. However, THE most annoying thing masks the experience. When scrolling, the app would register taps every time you lift your finger. You end up opening random items and having to back up every time."
"I upgraded to a fold 4 and the orders page is not good. On my Galaxy s22 ultra the orders page shows the next item being shipped on top all the time. The orders page for the note 4 is listed by date so if something takes 2 weeks to arrive I have to scroll through all my other orders that arrived in 1 or 2 days to find it. This makes the experience very tedious and I prefer not to feel this way when tracking an order. Please add a ""delivered"" filter, or duplicate the s22 orders page on the fold 4"
"Newest update 6th Apr 2021 awful. Just logged in to my amazon app and noticed you have moved the home, lists, cart and settings to the bottom of the screen. It's awful and a mess please change it back to how it was. What idiot has done this?? It's now near my back button etc. What's going on?? Seriously my experience which was great is now bad and in fact horrible.. Please change it back."
"UI change is just terrible. The search bar is now on the bottom, and each individual item in the search result takes up the entire screen. I do not understand why companies implement needless changes that make the app experience objectively worse. Why do this when filtering below a set price has not worked for the 7 years that I've bought stuff on Amazon? I wish I got paid 6 figures to sit in a board room and make terrible decisions."
"Although the service itself has proven to be great, the same cannot be said about the app, which is supposed to make it readily accessible. The app feels sluggish, looks outdated, and is in dire need of an overhaul. The perceived navigation is unresponsive and slow, as the interface regularly lags or even freezes. Menu items appear arbitrarily scattered in an unintuitive manner. Several half-baked options lack hinted UI elements, only adding to the overall frustrating customer experience."
My experience with amazon was great up until the past 6 months. I had canceled my prime membership which for some odd reason decided to renew and i didnt think much of it and canceled again. 2 months down the road it automatically renewed yet again without my consent and put my bank acc into the negatives. I canceled again and had it refunded. The final straw was when i figured out amazon music has been charging my account for over 6 months without my consent. I have since closed my amazon acc.
"This is the worst experience I have ever had. I've been a prime member for at least 15yrs. I ordered over $300 dollars in merchandise. half my order ($160) was sent back, because there weren't any empty lockers in the Amazon lockers. Instead of sending some kind of communication for me to pick it up instead. So now I have to wait 3 to 5 days for a refund just to reorder it. They could have gave me a credit so I could reorder instead of me waiting when they didn't have to wait for my payment."
Hate this app now as Search Bar is at the Bottom instead of the Top! Makes for an awkward app experience. Seriously does anyone working on this app even USE IT???!!! Clunky & search SUCKS. Promotes junk instead of the product I want to see. Very disappointed in this forced update. Change it back!!!! I will not be shopping in the app until it's changed.
Overall I love Amazon and the convenience of shopping and returns. I'd say 95% of the time customer service is extremely helpful. Over the years I've come across a few who either don't know their job (maybe new employee) or don't care about their job. I've only had 1 bad experience with customer service that made me question whether I'd continue the service. I've used Amazon shopping app to shop for the last few years and have never had trouble with it.
This app freezes constantly! Freezes my entire phone forcing me to restart phone constantly! I would do most of my shopping from Amazon if it wasn't so dang frustrating trying to use this app- I know it isn't my devices as I have the same issue regardless of device being used. Of the thousands of dollars I spend monthly this would be the primary source of my shopping if this app allowed for a smooth enjoyable experience. Hoping for change or a competitor to provide what Amazon promises!
"It got worse from bad. Now the text is all bunched up can not even read what i am buying properly. The user interface of the last update made the app less desirable and more cumbersome to use, also slower to react to button presses. I use the new app less now. I also buy less due to this downgrade of an update. I prefer the interface before this one as it was much more fluent and better to visualize and use. Please fix, it should be a win win for all."
Easy to search and find exactly what you have in mind.. It's easy to have bagged or wrapped for whatever occasion or holiday.. Various options for delivery.. All of these things are only some of the features included.. There is several more customizable features and alternative options you can choose to use and make your experience unique..
"I'm not exactly sure what I'm reviewing, but if it's Amazon in general, I can whole heartedly say that I am completely satisfied. The products, and customer service are exceptional. I always receive a prompt reply to questions or issues. I also appreciate the transparency with other customer reviews, even if they're not good. Overall, my experience with Amazon has been great!"
"last updates ruined all past positive experiences: 1. became much slower 2. only 15-20 items per page 3. (and the worst) after changing color/size of an item ""Done"" doesn't work, the only option is to ""go back"" to the list. 4. selecting only one option at a time in filters. seriously??"
"The drivers have failed to deliver my orders more than they have managed to deliver them properly, and I am honestly quite tired of having to seek customer service every single time I make an order. Very disappointing. When I actually recieve my packages, its usually always a great experience and fast shipping. I feel like they need more control in their amazon delivery drivers, and seek out these issues further because its very much a hassle and also concerning."
The most recent update appears to have screwed up functionality for a lot including myself. It was super slow and laggy. After a uninstall/reinstall it's back to being quick and amazing again. I would hope that people would try to reinstall the app before giving bad reviews but working in IT I know from experience people would rather complain than try to fix it lol. If you have these issues reinstall the app and reboot your phone.
"Amazon is great and all, well, that is if you don't consider the amount of junk you have to go through just to find a decent product, and if you can overlook the fact that the app (and website) looks like it's made to work exclusively with Windows 98, I'm guessing they like vintage, but at least make the interface usable for the common user. I mean, Zara's website is better than Amazon's. Do better, Jeff."
"ABSOLUTE WORST ONLINE SHOPPING EXPERIENCE IN MY LIFE. First, Amazon couldn't recognize the fact that payment went through and the app was asking me to update payment method endlessly. Then, support was useless and was unable to fix the issue in a timely manner or escalate to someone who could. And when I bought some more stuff, my account was locked and is still locked 24 hours after submitting billing details form. Oh, by the way the form won't allow to attach bank statement too. Great job 👍"
"IT'S BROKEN It refuses to even install on any of my devices now so way to go Amazon. Your shopping experience has been declining to now leaving a lot to be desired, but at least that won't be an issue for me anymore as access has now been cut right down from 4 mobile devices to having to fire up my PC. That's just too much like hard work. Here's an idea....just go back to selling ""just books"" you useless cvnts as you certainly can't do anything else right. Amazon?......... I'm done with you."
"Awful experience. Some of the worst navigation on an app. Normally you see the 'my account' icon and can easily check your delivery address, name, phone number, email etc very easily on any other app or website. This was atrocious. Want to check my order to make sure it went through."
Not really sure what the point of prime is if the company still picks and chooses when they want to ship your items and how long it's delayed. Even if it's something that should be delivered the next day. It's a miserable experience. And their streaming app doesn't make up for it. I'm really not sure if there are actually any perks at this point with prime. Not to mention I get more sponsored listings than anything else. It's just so off-putting.
"Frequently crashing . Recently attempted to purchase an item from my cart. At every step, received ""something went wrong"" message. While I love photos of dogs, it was a frustrating experience. Occurred even after I restarted my phone and cleaned the cashe. Had to place the order via the website on my computer."
"I've had few bad experiences where packages never got delivered and I was never refunded (maybe it was the company). Outside of that, I have had great experiences. what helps is investing in amazon prime, delivery has been great and quick. some delivery drivers delivered damaged packages, but products were in good condition. oh! also, amazon prime has other perks that are amazing. amazon shopping, with or without prime, is easy to figure out."
"The Amazon mobile App is no longer Amazing. I can understand shipping delays. Amazon prides itself on the online purchasing experience. The app has had a number of issues, The Oops Dog (Unable to find item) is one. Reviews for items showing a completely different item. The unending clocking at checkout which includes clocking when choosing another payment method, or free shipping that does not involve Amazon Prime, which is shoved down your throat at every opportunity. Ebay should thank Amazon!"
Until recently my experience was 5 stars Now maybe 3. I've subscribed since 2017 and always enjoyed the prime video. I've also enjoyed shopping and had no problems until recently. My payment method is not updating and therefore my subscription has been suspended and van get no further. Trying to resolve without canceling subscription but may have no other alternative.
"The newest version of the Amazon App doesn't require to download from an unknown source, which is why I uninstalled the older version. The new Amazon App has an easy to use user interface. I much prefer the new version. Love shopping on Amazon and being able to track package progress."
"*Edit:Amazon Smile - is now in settings* ... Finding specific settings to adjust is very difficult in general; there should be a site map or table of contents or something. Going through each sublink seems the only way to stumble upon new ways to personalize your account or experience. It would be nice to implement an advanced-search (of products) option as well, instead of going through each filter systematically."
Since they updated the app a few months ago the experience is so much worse. The app acts more like a really annoying mobile optimised website now. The back button does not take you back one page but rather takes you through previous searches you had. it is nearly impossible delete stuff out of the basket which is especially annoying when shopping for groceries and you realise some items are not available so you rather cancel the whole thing but you have to delete items one by one. etc.
"Easy ordering. Usually prompt delivery. There is one caviat. Make sure you check to see where your order is being shipped from. My daughter ordered a trampoline for my granddaughter's birthday. She ordered it a couple of months before, and it was never received it was shipped from China, and all the tracking information would say is either it was on its way or there was a delay in shipment. We finally did get a refund, but it was just a disappointing experience."
"Poor customer experience. Searches show sponsored items regardless of search string, sponsored items breaks the sorting feature, for example sorting items in order of price doesn't work at all. Returns are easy but contacting a seller has been made impossible so there is no way to get questions answered, you either love what you get or send it back, nothing in between is allowed via this app. Not made for the customer, not made for the sellers, made only for the sponsors. Would rather give 0/5"
"I prefer shopping online then in-store. Amazon makes this possible! They have a lot of products & if you're looking for something & can't find it in-stores, you can usually find it here. I am a loyal Amazon Prime member, & I believe the Prime membership is worth buying. My deliveries usually arrive fast, & the Prime Benefits are a plus. They also have great customer service! (which is extremely important to me) Amazon makes the shopping experience enjoyable for me & I hope they will for you!"
"this app has continued to decline over the years, despite the 'updates' and 'improvements'. regular interruptions of shopping experiences with errors that send us back to the home screen, attempts to access the cart to check out that send us back to a previously viewed item. the inability to properly synch carts across devices. from annual profits, prioritising a properly functioning shopping app should be common sense, right? a new feature has been added - repetitive crashing while shopping..."
My experience with Amazon have never been better. You get what you buy and no rip offs . Definitely recommend.
"I am satisfied and have been using amazon for years. Mostly credible good service. A downfall is interface with local delivery services. For. ex. I orderded a book and could see it was processed and shipped, but could not track it after that. I got a notification that it is on the way to delivery point, and will be notified when it arrives. From a refund notification I found out it made it to the collecting point but I never got any notification its there to be collected."
Worst ecommerce experience. Customer sevice are faking promises. Nothing on time and very rude. I tried both amazon UAE & Egypt.
"This app killed my Christmas shopping experience, I had placed an order on the 7th with express shipping. I monitored the item waiting for the shipped status to show. Not only did it not ship, it has been totally wiped from any type of existence in my history and orders placed. I wasnt charged at least. Now to put in extra time out on foot with time I didn't have in the fort place. Waste my time not once, but twice! All I'll say is support local business before considering this app pls!"
"My experience may help you. I use a well known VPN provider which I am always connected to 24/7. The app fails 80-90% of the time, with loads of uh-oh's & other issues. Turn ""Off"" the VPN, and in my case, the app performs flawlessly. So what to make of all this? This worried me at first, but I later realised that lots of non-vpn users use Amazon's fully encrypted secure payment system everyday and it works perfectly well, with or without a VPN, as it must. If you use a VPN - give it a try."
"This is a really good app, I have never used the website as I was a late adopter to the amazon club due to a really bad experience the first time I used it years before. But this app is fantastic, the only thing I would LOVE to see it the ability to manually mark products as received! Right at this moment I have 4 items that I have received, but still showing up as awaiting delivery. Which happens all the time."
"good integration into the shop; user experience, especially for using lists, could be improved"
"Every experience has turned out to be positive. Even when something had gone wrong customer service fixed the problem immediately! I love shopping on Amazon! Definitely one of my favorite shopping apps, if not the best!! Thank you Amazon workers for everything you guys do especially during this pandemic. Now we know nothing will ever slow you guys down!"
"The functionality of the app is terrible. There's no filtration system for what you looking for specifically, all the comparisons in the world but if you can't edit what comparisons you looking for don't feel too down what you're looking for it's kind of pointless. Not being able to filter your results when you search is terrible. And user interface being optionable to what you see as a user and what you like is user I mean 90% of the other apps that they have this function why doesn't you"
"I love this app, it's so easy to go down the rabbit hole here, so much to choose from.. The layout and navigation is awesome which makes it easy to search for a particular item. If you have a bad experience, they help to try to fix the issue. I didn't realize how many days had gone by and I hadn't received my product. Amazon sent me a message and drew my attention to it. Great app!"
"Great offer free delivery trial. I don't have enough experience with ordering to use app. Or others. Walmarts is difficult too. But my vehicle has been not drivable for 4 months now. These free delivery trials are very good, handy, a life saver. Thank you by the way...if made it more simple, more efficient trying to simply type what need and it do what asked for.. I tried to reach customer service 50 x's different pre suggested ways and found it some how. Needs redesigned from ""broad look"" """
"HATE this new app interface!!! Whoever thought this was a good decision should be fired. The new app is not user friendly like the old one, and is complete garbage. It is counter intuitive to fast easy shopping, and did I mention UGLY as sin? For whoever designed and approved this change, fire them and put this nonsense back to a user friendly interface that doesn't have the menu where the phone controls are (ever heard of ""ain't broke don't fix it"" ? Wasn't broke, didn't need ""fixing"")."
"A series of horrible experiences. I always order from Amazon and they always refund when there's an issue, but that's just no longer bearable. 1) 2 broken glass deodorant bottles on my doorstep with liquid leaking from the packaging and leaving permanent stains on the tiles. 2) when i order water, there's always a 20% chance that the item won't be delivered at all, even after I receive a notification that it got delivered 3) I just received the wrong item which I bought as a gift for my wife."
"Amazon prices have gone up a LOT this past year. Most things used to be cheaper on Amazon... check pricing before you buy!!! There are many other options now days as stores have set up pickup and delivery. Amazon's customer service is also not always great, I am sure it depends on who you get, but some of my experience has not been favorable."
"I love the Prime app. However, it has a language glitch. . The app and the website automatically changes my language preferences to Spanish when I open a shared link (cart items) from someone who uses the settings in Spanish and it takes a number of times to reset the language back to English permanently. Please fix it. I have use this app for many years an couldn't be happier. It offers every option to make easier your shopping experience."
"three stars may be a bit harsh but I'm doing this relative to just going on the browser which is an awesome user experience. but the app fall short along with a few other gripes, e.g.default address and cards my main ones are; Wish lists, why can't we search wish lists? Cats and dogs are not the same stop notifying me that you think i might be interested in cat food, I'm really not, I even set-up Amazon pet (in browser as it doesnt seem to exist in app) thinking that would clue you in but nope."
"The app is fairly easy to use; however, when you search for something what you want isn't always the first thing that pops up. Additionally, the customer service over chat sucks! Some of the worse customer service I have experienced. Also, items constantly arrive late. But this isn't the apps fault."
"Misleading, returns take forever to process, product quality is vary hit or miss, unreliable expensive and UNTRUSTWORTHY. Purchased a brand new console from here and it was busted out of the box and it lied to me about being new as the box had recycled product stickers on it. By far the worst shopping experience I've had with them and I still haven't gotten my return money from the expensive product."
"I already had a bad experience before with my order but I used it again since the thing I needed was available only on Amazon. Payment issues, they charged my card and suspended my account. Apparently it was a suspicious payment. If it is a suspicious payment, why did you get the money? You were supposed to cancel the order.Customer service is useless and waste of time. I submitted my bank details and ID to recover my account but no success. Thanks! I will raise a chargeback to get my money back"
"Mostly positive experience, but keep an eye on your order's delivery date. I have seldom had any issue with my packages, and when I do, customer service is usually very helpful. I have received some damaged or broken packages but was able to quickly receive a replacement. There was one time a package never arrived, it was during the holidays so with all the other packages I was receiving I did not notice in time, and I just had to eat the cost of the item. Pay attention to delivery dates!"
"Painfully slow. This is the first time using this app and to be honest, I will most likely uninstall it. Why has Amazon failed to ensure that this is a fully functional app? It kept flagging errors where there was no reason. In all the years that I have been an Amazon member, I have never experienced anything like this. It was uncomfortable to use and I have enough problems dealing with Amazon's Fresh deliveries without also complaining about their app."
"Most of the products are missing significant data in the descriptions. The weight/volume/sizing units are interspersed, using metric, imperial and US customary measurement systems making price comparison a complete nightmare! Many times I have simply stopped looking and gone to Ebay and other online stores. With simple standards in place, it would be so much easier to buy. I win, Amazon wins, the vendors/suppliers win. The more convoluted the shopping experience becomes, the faster I walk away."
"I use this app quite a lot and have mostly positive experiences, so I wouldn't feel right giving it less than 3 stars. HOWEVER can someone explain to me why it takes SO LONG for the pictures to load (if they ever do) to look at a product close up? It can be infuriating to want to read the text on a box front more clearly, but the dang pics never want to load. I am in grey loading ring hell 90% of the time"
"Never really used Amazon just Ebay but in my experience there customer service isn't as good as it used to , so saying that I started using Amazon and really happy with the speed of delivery, and having used there customer service's on two occasions and on both time's was delt quickly, yes price and quality is important but so is customer service, so on my experience over several months I give Amazon 6 stars. Keep it up Amazon. D Cross"
"I couldn't be any more pleased with my experience with Amazon, everything I have ordered has arrived in the designated time frame and it's just so much simpler to do, I save money, I save time and there is so many different verities in everything that you get the item you really want instead of having to settle with what the other store may have. I can truly say that I enjoy shopping now and there is no waiting lines, I haven't had to punch anyone in the face in months now. thanks to Amazon"
"Thanks Amazon. Using the Subscribe function they let me know the day it's supposed ship that they are out. I've been subscribed to these items for years. Shouldn't a company the size, scope, and experience of Amazon store items that are non perishable and and under subscription to their regular customers? Nope. Should I continue using Amazon and their app? Nope."
"Lots of selections to choose from. You can do all your shopping needs with Amazon. Name brand items some are way to expensive but some are better. I think everyone should try shopping with Amazon at least one time in there life to see just how good the experience is , I'm sure once you do you will be back with this app you can have it all I just love that this app is available for users to enjoy shopping."
"Horrible experience this past couple of months. I've used their ordering service for years with some hiccups, but never issues like this. The last 3 packages I've order say they are delivered yet I have never received them. And their customer support just runs you through circles without providing any true help other than ""online store credit for new products"". If this is the way you guys will operate going forward I can't use the service anymore and will cancel my prime membership"
Really bad experience so far Troubles logging in and out even though I enter the right info but keeps telling me there is a mistake. One of my orders has been cancelled because I used direct bank account payment but not a credit or debit card. + PayPal is not included in payment methos and that is a big shame for such a platform like Amazon and for that it deserves a rating below 0 but unfortunately there is no other options less than one star otherwise I would give it. Add PayPal please.
"The worst Amazon.de experience ever, I lost trust in them. I have ordered an item from them , that was in stock and 8 days passed already since the order, they still didn't ship the item. What pisses me off, is the lack of execution on the customer service side, i asked what's happening, all 3 customer service people assured me item is on its way, will arrive in 4-5 days, all 3 lied, all 3 used automatic messages instead of real problem solving. I lost trust in Amazon today."
"I've been an Amazon customer many years. This my first Amazon locker pick up. I couldn't open locker because the app thinks my location services is off. Google maps knows where I am, so location services is on. The human at customer service couldn't remotely open the locker. So my experience with the app and the locker have been a waste of time."
Terrible search engine! The whole shopping experience is massively marred by can only be explained as a 'lucky dip' search experience. Even if you search for the exact title of an item it will bring up something wildly unrelated and then after a good 5 minutes of looking I give up and go to ebay 2 minutes later I've already bought the things I need. I can't believe a company that is so forward looking has such a fundamentally terrible user experience! I only keep trying as I'm a subscriber!
I absolutely love Amazon!! Everything I have order has been free shipping and come within 2 day!! I have only had to return one item because my son no longer needed it. That experience was surprisingly easy also. I just took it to Kohl's and they packaged it and returned it free of charge. I highly recommend Amazon shopping to anyone who had never used it!!
"Amazon, both the company and its app, just gets worse and worse. The interface is cumbersome and becomes less and less user friendly. Cumbersome to use, improper loading etc. I have noticed a marked decline in its products, vendors, shipping, service etc over the past year."
Great app and experience overall - but one really annoying issue is the fact the the delivery driver can drive right past your home just because there are more stops left - I'm assuming this is software based and its a list but this should be altered and mixed in with proximity this will save both energy and make delivery for some users quicker.
"My experience with this app is quite unpleasant because it's overly complicated for such simple services. An incredibly thoughtful, considerate gesture but, sadly more inconvenient than it should be with that in mind. Thank you so much for trying to help families and individuals who do use SNAP EBT. However I got dizzy trying to grasp which foods were EBT eligible and what I could not purchase with it. You SHOULD link the Amazon Prime app with Wholefoods shopping lists making it easier."
"Good enough to sell stuff, I guess. Scrolling lists often does not work. List management over all could have a much improved user experience. Not sure about the new funcionality, where it throws all items in your lists together into one. Why do you think I sort stuff into different lists in the first place?"
"The lastest updated forced an Amazon Search option into the Android Copy-Paste menu, and forced Amazon Search to the top of the Android Share menu. This is an unacceptable hijacking of otherwise useful menus. Also the app in general is slow, unorganized, buggy, and a miserable user experience."
"I only purchase from Amazon as a last resort because it's such a pain. Amazon is the only retailer I've EVER purchased from that takes multiple days to process payment. Y'all, it is 2023. No one keeps a checkbook anymore. How hard is it to process payment at the time of purchase??? EVERY other retailer does. Also, your delivery drivers literally put my packages in the alley next to my trash can– who does that!? I have had an extremely poor experience using this app."
"The mammoth collection of products and services that can be ordered from Amazon are organized conveniently in this feature rich app. Options such as personal lists, surveys, try and buy, or gift finder complete a solid experience. Custom sorting of shopping list items which is existing in desktop version is missing though."
"They changed the layout of the app's interface. What for? So that the developer would have something to do? It has been working perfectly before and I prefer the search bar located at the top. You can barely post your review this time because that UGLY search bar covers the ""POST"" tab. Another thing, Bezos has become SUPER GREEDY his minions won't let you use your gift card balance to be credited to your Amazon store card balance. They'd like you to buy some more! THESE PEOPLE ARE CROOKS!"
"Bitter experience. Becareful when you use the app, make sure you keep your personal record or invoice of items/goods ordered because the app will not. So that when you want to complaint about undelivered item you will have a record to do so. This is my personal experience. List of items ordered wasn't correctly stored on the app. Unfortunately, one of the item that wasn't delivered is missing, therefore, making a formal complaint herculean expect reference to payment. 1 star"
"How's Amazon UK such a terrible app! It's very disorganised, no categories, no suggestions for new apps, just the same items on the home screen, honestly its a bore, they should try and look at apps like Amazon Dubai and work on their user interface suggestions and improve the app, otherwise it's terrible to say the least"
I've never really had a good experience shopping with Amazon their app wants so badly to be finicky and not get what anything is and or what your doing I've never had any problems with any of the other apps like this they either don't bring your stuff or it didn't actually go through or some problems always occur and its sad because they're the only place I've shopped with and actually get my stuff as is advertised if you've an abundance of money and patience this is better then most likewise
"Just realized how flawed online shopping is. Instead of getting my order, after much delay I Instead received someone's dirty shoes in an open box. Now for months I have an ongoing issue of trying to prove my innocence. Totally turned off from the online shopping experience. Will never buy shoes from Amazon again. Only small items where I don't have much to lose."
"So far I have never had a package come up missing after delivery or have I needed to return item over damages. Amazon is very convenient for a person like me. P.S. Always do the survey after delivery and click ""Above and Beond"" I guarantee you a better experience. And they will appreciate it in the long drive."
"Terrible delivery experience in the last month. Drivers don't even attempt to knock on the door. Just leave it on your doorstep in rain or snow to be damaged or stolen (even if you're in). It has gone to the high court and amazon has basically said ""f u"". Very sad because it's a useful app. Basically don't order anything expensive and pay more to order directly from the company and forget amazon. I've heard even if you get a police crime number reporting theft they will still not sometimes refun"
"Good experience on samsung phone, total trash on samsung tablet... Recently, the Amazon app totally stopped working on my galaxy tab s9 ultra and now I can only access it through a browser. It totally kills the experience so I just stopped using this idiotic app on my tablet."
"Horrible. First order they charged my card more than what was shown when finalising payment. Took 2 days of chatting and having to explain the issue to at least 6 different people then finally getting a credit when I was on the phone for 30min. Only given a credit, so no I have to buy more from Amazon to get the $ they overcharged. Horrid experience."
"BARELY usable app. What takes 30 seconds in browser will take 5 mins in app; that is if the app doesn't force close itself. You would think a company as wealthy as Amazon would have an app that is seamless or at least functional. Search will bring up 50% repeat dropshipped sponsored listings and 50% products that are actually worthwhile. It's no wonder folks flock to apps like Shein because at least they prioritize the user experience, not just ad revenue. Updates do nothing to fix the issues."
"Still a bloated or horrible ui experience; nothing has changed there. A tab should be for one thing; if I click cart, I want the cart. If I click the home page, I want my last search or the homepage on second click. This app now freezes as I scroll (laggy API calls?). Might uninstall and just use the mobile browser as I lost faith in the app; always found the mobile browser better across all apps. Hopefully you dont slam ""use the app, it is better"" around like the others."
"I normally love Amazon but recently the delivery drivers have been dropping the ball. If there is a delivery after 8pm it suddenly and magically becomes undeliverable because the delivery driver ""couldnt find"" my address. The most recent experience was a package with a delivery picture that looked NOTHING like my front door or my mail room. It looked like it was taken in someones livingroom. Very disappointed. If this keeps up ill be cancelling my membership because im quickly losing faith."
"My experience is so bad. I lost the number I used for my two step verification and I can't log into my account despite having tried everything, even before then they refused to send an otp to my number probably because I'm Nigerian, that's is so discriminatory and unfair. Their customer service is rubbish with this latest upgrade, you can't even contact them via email for a delayed book publishing."
my experience with shopping with Amazon has been good so far. I get what I paid for and learned to do research before buying the first thing you see. Unfortunately I am bias when it come to only shopping since Amazon is the only one I've ever used and trust. Overall when it comes to service and getting what you paid for securely delivered in my personal opinion no one does it better than Amazon.
"Horrible experience. Crashes, slow loading, and now the ap has a pop up that it is no longer supported for mobile. Disappointing I no longer have the convenience but using the website was always faster anyways."
I've had a great experience with Amazon shopping! It's so easy and returns are just as simple. If I have any problems customer service solves my problems with ease as well! I highly recommend it!
"Company Over Customer I find myself reaching for another device or simply searching a different retailer. The search feature limits your results if you choose anything but the featuted sort option. And the choice of brands for filtering is equally limiting. Simply put, a frustrating shopping experience that seems to favor quantity over quality."
The new layout is not intuitive at all. Very frustrating to use when you're in a rush and text size is oddly chosen for option menus. This has not made the user experience any better when no other app is structured this way. Please roll it back.
One thing amazon has that is good is the delivery. It shows when your order is near by. But when ordering it's really a 50/50 thing like all app. One thing I really dislike about Amazonis that when contacting the seller you never get a response or answer for your questions. So when something goes wrong with your order you might not get a solution. I experienced situation where their was no solution. $$ LOST.
"I've only had good experiences buying from Amazon. Everything you've sold me has either been perfect for my needs and at a fair-to-great price, or, you've let me return it with minimal hassle. Amazon is basically what Sears would've been if Eddie Lampert hadn't ran them into the ground. Just like Sears in their prime; Amazon today has the best customer service, best brands, a vast selection of pretty-much everything, and great shipping options. This app is an excellent way to shop Amazon. ★★★★★"
"New update is awful. It takes ages to launch, you just get a blank white screen for upwards of 20 seconds. When it finally does launch the new user interface is pretty rubbish. Hate the buttons being down the bottom and it looks like a child developed it or it's designed for a child to use. Not impressed."
Many times this people play with my money and time. You buy the item they tel you to upgrade your experience to prime and you pays even more and then couple of days later they put a message on your app item delivered on your door or porch but just one problem when you check it's not there. Then you claim and that's when the nightmare starts. They make you contact the seller and if he don't respond in two days then they start an investigation to decides if you get your money back. I hate this.
New 6/23 upgrade glitches Don't know why they keep messing with the app it has always been good. Now with the latest upgrade after about 25 secs it glitches (not my phone issue it only happens with this app and since the upgrade). The last 2 orders I made were made out of sure determined repeated attempts. I thought the idea was to allow for a smooth shopping experience and easy ordering. Hard to do either right now. AMAZON PLEASE FIX THE PROBLEM so I can shop again.
"Its been very frustrating to have live streams pop up on the home screen of the app. Pointless and its easy to accidentally select that or the ""this or that"" while you're scrolling. Its made it super annoying to use the app. Have started to just use the web version on a computer because the experience on mobile is just going downhill."
I love the convenience of shopping at home along with so many great prices.. Excellent customer service communication when needed and even if or when you are dissatisfied with any products Amazon always makes it right.. I just love the freedom of shopping with a great company I have grown to trust!!!! Amazon shopping Thank you for always being #1 and always a great at home shopping experience!!!!! You have thousands and thousands of choices of everything you may need or desire no matter what!!!!
"New app design is actually really good, minus you can't navigate to customer support without searching help or googling Amazon support in app and getting redirected to the app from the Google search. Seems like they did this on purpose which is super lame. also automated chat assistant is super bad. Suggests things and if it's wrong gives you no way to change the answer they suggest. Just seems like they want it all automated but it's done so in a worse experience"
"Can't find anything in a specified search. Results shown unhelpful. Large view photos won't load, just buffers endlessly. Poor organization, useless layout, pointless compartmentalizion. Massively glitchy, screen flickers constantly then force crashes itself. Immensely frustrating shopping experience. Harshly rated for all reasons stated."
"Aplication itself is garbage. Not user friendly experience. Can't find what I want fast enough. Missing accurate filters. Search sucks, it gives me completely different results. Can't contact to seller, it sends me to FAQ. Delivery aslo sucks. One time I got used thing, but in delivery it said ""new"". Can't recieve my things on time. Sometimes it takes 5 or more days for seller to send me my order"
"Had the app decide to start ordering for me costing currently $85 and counting in nsf/overdraft fees. According to customer service it is "" entirely impossible as the app doesn't work that way just return it and we will refund it"" and yet I'm being resent these same packages ... very poor relations will NEVER use Amazon again. Worst experience with any online shopping system."
"This app is so garbage now. I can't even use the live chat with customer service anymore without uninstalling and reinstalling the app, just so I can see what I'm typing because the interface won't adjust for my keyboard on my phone. They have also as a whole been a terrible company for the past 2 months! I've had nothing but trouble with deliveries from them in that time and no matter how much I report and complain, they do nothing to fix things and prefer to remain broken as hell."
The worest app and online experience i have ever had. I will not buy from them again. The items I purchaced from them 90% of them didnt arrive while they sending email to rate the item!! the other 5% is damaged. And for the exercise bike i bought was damaged. they replaced to me with another one had worse damage than the old one. and because it is cost over 200$ they just play with refund. they asked me to wait 2 weeks after the end of the period the ask for two weeks more.
Worst customer service experience of my life. Was tranfered back and forth from Canadian adviser to American side.. on hold for over 30 minutes at a time... my time is important too. All to update a credit card so I wouldn't lose my services even though I'm not due for renewal until Jan 2019. I had to update credit card or lose my services I already paid in advanced for??.. There are many more on line shopping sites. Offering deals just as good.. time to move on.
The app is probably one of the best shopping apps that you can find but of course that comes from years of experience and being the number one online shopping choice for the entire world. I almost want to take away one star because the new app icon is terrible
"Amazon has always had the best customer experience but things are changing. I ordered an item 40 days ago and it was shipped by ups. tracking info says item could be lost, when I first contacted amazon they said they'll refund me and still deliver the item as a token of apology. I followed up the second time they said they'll only refund me. third time they say they have to wait for the carrier to return the item. Fourth time I was asked to contact the carrier and that's how I lost my money"
"Amazon keeps making their app worse vs improving on a very aged and non-user friendly interface. Instead, they focus on all the ridiclous product live streams and irrelevant ads. Not to mention how the app is constantly making connection attempts to various Amazon servers that hosts ads and collects metrics from your device. I guess those things take precidence over their retail customers."
"Became horrible user experience! Reloads for several times randomly, functions poorly and the ln shows a very limited and short amount of products... Also expensive... Probably amazing service for people from USA but seems like it degraded here ):"
"The app is deceiving, it appears to function well and even gives the illusion that you are having the same experience you would have on the website. However if you pull up the website and compare you begin to notice some differences and realize that the website is far better. For one thing the website actually let's you know what the delays are if there are any, the app feels more like it's stuck in limbo the moment something goes wrong with your order. I'd say more but I have run out of space."
"Mention the Amazon search function among friends and expect eyerolls. It's 2021, folks are experienced with effective searching. Heck, I was trained to search for my career. Yet my Amazon result lists are frequently populated with extraneous products (not sponsored ads) through which I have to scroll and scroll (and scroll). We are Prime members because Amazon makes so many things easier. Please provide better search tools and improve your algorithms so searching Amazon is less of a time sink."
Customer service was awful. I have ordered three items. Two of the three items arrived within three days. The third item did not arrive. After 10 days and countless messages with the customer service it turned out they have been lying the whole time. After 10 days i still haven't even gotten the estimated delivery date and was repeatedly asked to wait additional 3 days. The item was sold by Amazon and was in stock. Worst experience ever. Cancelled ny order and bought from more expensive store.
my first bad experience with Amazon. I order a part for my work truck was a two day shipping and my order was shipped late and is coming a day later. I had a few other options for cheaper costing parts that would of came at the same time frame not very happy. customer service was no help. If it happens again it will be the last time I order thru Amazon
"I don't know what we would do without Amazon, lol. Great: 👍 The mighty-giant might track you to your grave, but it does provide awesome prices, awesome shopping 💸 & shipping 📦 experiences, and not to mention long-lasting orders history. 📝 😆 Bad: 👎My only concern is that the app takes a lot of space, just like Facebook. 😔 Suggestion:💡 'Amazon Lite' app would be awesome for data & storage savers."
"App is much better now. No problems as in past experiences. Only I believe there is a glitch in the app because I will get an offer of a coupon to save on an item and leave the page/app for a while and upon returning the offer is no longer there and the price is higher I clear my cache and go back to shopping and voila, it's back."
"They just dropped tablet support, so I can't even write a bad review for the app on that device. Having a bigger screen, and an interface that's designed for the screen, instead of a website, is key to having a usable service. Very hard to use new setup for older people."
"Please give an option to choose the new or the classic wish list interface. The new interface is completely unhelpful and only adds more clicks/taps to get to where I really want to be. Not to mention, for privacy reasons maybe one doesn't want *everything* appearing on the landing page."
"Still, after years, remains buggy. UI update is not good and, like others have said, counterintuitive. Now, when get to the page to change my delivery address, it just won't. I have to preemptively change the delivery address before I get to the cart now. For being one of the richest companies, it is pathetic how horrendous the app has become. A frustrating experience, but they know they can remain low effort because we still have to order items..."
"Great app but one problem always seems to persist and it can sometimes ruin an entire shopping experience and make you just go to a store: unrelated products appearing in search results.. Either completely irrelevant or wrong products/featured poor quality products that ship from China relentlessly flood your search results on anything you type in. Example: just bought some LED headlights but I searched ""halogen"". Overwhelming amount of ""LED"" products so I just gave in. Hopefully they're good!"
"The image scrolling is completely freezing, this is both on chrome and Android app. Please fix, ruins the experience of shopping. By images,I am referring to the 4-5 images that show up of the product I open. These images are are the top part of any product page"
Change the app back to the old settings please. This new interface is NOT user-friendly. Please change it to something else thats not on the bottom like that. Awful design. Please change it back. Ive been trying to use the app for two days now and its impossible. Nothing works except purchasing stuff. I cant look through my account or do the daily spin thing because your app is no longer able to be navigated. I am 25 and this app is designed by someone who has never used a phone
Lots of great value found within Amazon Canada shopping... tough to beat. Some items such as home improvement / hardware are still a bit pricey. Virtually everything's available within Canada except perishable groceries. Hopefully we'll see that in the future soon. The variety of overall choice is amazing. Amazon Prime benefits definitely add up to be worth it if you shop exclusively on Amazon. Customer service is the absolute epitome of professionalism. Highly recommended shopping experience.👍
"The Amazon app is becoming unusable. The app is always freezing while scrolling through the home page, or an item's details page. Changing an item's options like ""color"" or ""size"" has frequently caused the app to freeze for 10-30 seconds. This is a terrible customer experience."
"Not good at all. I have moved to Spain an amazon.es it's ether in Spanish or Portuguese. So in hopes to have at least my main interface in English and not rely on google to translate all site I have installed this app on my phone just to waist another 3h and find out I cannot set in preferences language. Yes, if you pick language English it's forcing you to pick other region which means you switching store all together. Have also tried to contact help desk about this issue ) but again language."
"Best online experience 👍 with best customer service ever, all my purchases through them, all issue being solved on spot and always satisfactory result"
"Only one (frustrating) irritation... More often that not, I have multiple items in my cart that I'm not ready to checkout. But there is one single item that I'm ready to checkout. This app won't allow me to selectively checkout just one item in my cart! There is a 'Deselect all items' if I'm on my desktop. Why doesn't the mobile app has that? It kills the entire shopping experience. Other than this issue, I've to say this App performs way better than all the big names shopping carts out there."
"(first off let me start by saying that I'm worst at returning the items, given the fact that my most recent purchase did not complete my outfit for the look I was trying to achieve. All of that was overshadowed by the mere fact that I was able to return the set items to my local Kohl's retail Department with absolutely no discrepancies. thank you for the convenience in this process. Amazon has me as a customer viewing my membership in much more of a user friendly online experience. thank you."
"Was good until recently when, while scrolling thru products when searching, they begin playing thumb nail videos of what you are trying to see as soon as it gets to the middle of the screen. Makes it impossible to scan through products quickly. The amount of wasted time and frustration isn't worth it. Horrible user experience."
"Lags, freezes, refuses to load. Completely terrible experience. I have to restart the app about every ten minutes each time I use it. (For reference, I'm using this app on my Android 10 operated cellphone) There are many listings that are misleading (lies about capacity, material/ingredients, size, etc). There are also plenty of poorly made knockoff/counterfeit products from China just like on Wish or Aliexpress. So you have to shop smart."
I am a prime member and couldn't be happier. I have dealt with amazon customer service a couple of time and they are easy and great to deal with. They also have a messenger option for their customer service which make handling questions much eaiser. The prime video and music are great additions to the service and when coupled with an Echo makes for an enjoyable experience. All and all I am very satisfied customer.
Fast! Returnable! Great customer service! Many options! Wonderful shopping experience! Amazon!!!
Couldn't give the new App NO STARS....I understand updating it to include the AmazonSmiles feature which I thought was great but to rework the home screen is a waste of man hours. You made it WAY WORSE. End-user experience in my opinion is horrible. I will be deleting the app and be forced to use Amazon in Chrome as a favorite & never close the page so I have access at the ready. I help design apps for other companies & betatest them and you didn't get your monies worth with this one. Sorry.
"For a better searching experience, look at random items until you find what you want. Look, if you're shopping on Amazon you should be using a browser, not just because the experience is vastly improved by any number of third party extensions (honey and fakespot are the ones I use most often) but also because you can sometimes find what you're looking for using advanced search features."
"Amazon is... Amazon. An absolute 'jungle' mess of random products with hopelessly inconsistent pricing, delivery timeframes and information. The soulless purchasing experience - devoid of any personal human contact - epitomises the classic modern approach to commercialism. Disappointing and frustrating to use. BUT, their customer service is great so credit where it's due particularly if something does go wrong."
"What is there not to like about Amazon? There interface system is easy to browse through. The filter selection is useful. I wish I could narrow furniture searches to $25 or under. But hey, most furniture is not this price as is. Jeffery Bezos is a mastermind of his own kind. He's also an original NM resident. I can't complain. Ranging from proructs to books Amazon has it all. They ensure their products and the sources. In addition, the shipping. Might I add, I love Alexa so... Dun dun dun"
"Lately the delivery quality has dropped a lot. In the past two months, two separate orders never arrived and at least 4 delivered significantly late even though all of them were Prime delivery (second day). So I'm canceling my prime subscription. I think there is a massive problem in the UK operations because I have been using Amazon for years in UAE and never experienced these kind of issues. I hope the management can take actions and fix the delivery before it's too late."
"Jut trying to help. You're losing lots of customers because of how user-unfriendly your website and app are. Compared to the competition, such as noon, or even normal electronics companies' websites, amazon's interface is a bit too complicated and not pleasing to the eye. Moreover, not putting the price under each product is also an issue."
"Terrible customer service and experience. Today, all the sudden, Amazon is not allowing me to get into the app neither use the website. Tried to reset my account but the link are sending to my phone is not able to load anything. Checking online the service 'has no issues'. No able to contact customer service if you are not logged."
"A poorly designed app : excessively complicated (frequently showing irrelevant things) and yet delivers limited functionality (eg. Cannot manage subscriptions through this app, have to use browser version). In addition to this there is Amazon shopping experience which has become really lazy and low quality recently. I don't buy things from this company and yet manage to find everything elsewhere at usually a better price and from a provider who I can query specifically. this app : A poor job"
"New App update is clumsy, unintutitive and user hostile. Instead of fixing the obvious problem of not being able to deselect all items in order to selectively purchase they gave it a hideous new icon and made the interface worse. The interface was obviously designed by someone who must not ever use it. Re: Not offhand remarks, I formerly owned a software development company until I sold it to a large nationwide company. This needs to be fixed or permit downgrading."
"Amazon!!! What's happened!!! I cannot get a full view on page anymore. We need to see larger product. It won't enlarge items!!! It's not compatible with my 9 inch Tablet (portrait). Even on (landscape) you have to scroll sidways. It's a horrible experience now. The screen looks bitty and jumbled. Not crisp, and keeps moving around and unstable. On my phone it's ok, you can still scroll down."
Amazon App is crashing constantly in Android 11 models and higher Android version too. In the app during Recycler view model time also problem is there. The scroll time we can't see new views. It is stuck and the app is forcefully stopped.Last week App was slow but still worked. Today it is crashing constantly. Thanksgiving break is coming soon and market will go high at this time. Please check for heavy load testing too. Because last year I experienced poor performance of the app during holiday
"Great shopping experience, wonderful customer service and use to be fast delivery before Covid-19. Its a shame to pay for membership for 2 day delivery and now its rare to get your items in 2 days anymore. This app won't even open or install since the last update!! Please fix it!!!! I noticed it was glitchy the past week or so but the update made it worse now i can't readily track my orders!"
"App is so slow, on my 3 devices. I have two phones and a tablet. Just getting to my orders takes forever and it's just not a user friendly experience. I've literally just started shopping elsewhere because I don't have the patience required to navigate in an app that moves at a glacial pace."
"The latest redesign is pretty bad for my own user experience. It is far less responsive (it now lags when I try to load my orders, never did that before) and less intuitive (placement of the menu button in the bottom right runs counter to what most apps have) than the previous setup."
I'm basically done with this. This app literally never cancels even with my order within that hour. I have better experiences with EBAY. I literally got a notification maybe 5 minutes after requesting a cancellation and it hasn't even shipped or been a day. Same thing every time.
"I wish I knew about Amazon allot sooner then I did because of all the great services they offer. I used wish all the time until now Amazon is my go to for shopping online. The app is easy to navigate, Amazon Prime offers 2 day quick shipping, unbeatable competitive prices, and its convenience! Their customer service is great in responding quickly and making their customers experience their top priority. One of my favorite features is the opportunity to subscribe to household items you need."
This app keeps freezing and gives a pop-up saying it's not responding and click on close app or wait. Funny whenever they get it working smoothly they then mess with it some more. Makes it a very frustrating shopping experience. This much frustration I may as well go back to ebay or aliexpress and save a few bucks. Very disappointed
Used to be awesome. Recent update changed it. It constantly flashes and stops working. I have uninstalled three times. My husband is having the same issue. I have spent so much with Amazon Prime. I really hope this is fixed soon so we can get back to the five star experience.
"Worse than the site. Handles all the Amazon links, and provides a worse interface than the site would. Admittedly, it does have useful delivery notifications, but then they add Prime and which cannot be skipped (""Continue shopping"" doesn't work) other than by killing the app. Given that I do have prime subscription, trying to upsell it by ruining the UX doesn't quite align with LP, but then who cares?"
"Amazon is no longer what it used to be. Prime is not what it used to be. The Amazon app is not what it used to be. I have to erase my browsing history in order to cut the ads, the videos and the ""suggested for you"" bull in half. I'm not going to renew my Prime account until they get their act together. Amazon is completely ruined. It's now an entirely different and annoying experience. Thanks Moronzon!"
"Fast shipping is a thing of the past. Has my subscription cancelled for a while. Gave it another shot and my first order is delayed. In fact, every order says ""sorry we're running late."" The tracking gives vague information on where my package is. Picked up by carrier. Delayed in transit. Really? That's all amazon can tell me? Once I get my items I'm cancelling my subscription. I been having a better experience on eBay."
"It's been pretty good, but the forced move away from the Whole Foods app was the biggest mistake ever. I liked the interface on the WF app. It was WAY better at helping you ""buy again"", and every time I'm shopping for WF now, and I enter something in the search bar, it searches ALL of Amazon. Not needed. Way to muck things up here people."
"Latest updates really have trashed the user experience. Scrolling through any item pics somehow manages to land me repeatedly into my account, and that's only if the item pics actually maximize (often just loads a blank screen). Dreadful user testing there Amazon. Please roll back until problems are fixed."
"My experience on this websites has so far have been minimal, but I keep learning and asking ""the questions that everyone else wants to but don't want to look dumb. I don't care if I look dumb, because I know that I'm only ignorant. The purchses we've made over the years are well loved and used. Sometimes for theis intented purpose other times repurposed. Being a Prime member get some tremendous discounts and the free shipping pays off the minimal fee for Amizon Prime quickly. Back to shoppin"
"With the app installed on my phone, I cannot open any Amazon links in Google search results. I get a gray banner across the top of the screen, and the rest of the app never paints. Anything I search for within the app is fine, but it seems silly for the app to ruin the experience for getting to your store from general searches."
Poor shopping experience! It was good at the beginning. The fares of international shipping was fair and there was an option of free international shipping over 50$. Now it's terrible. I can't find any worth item in this app. The prices are expensive plus international shipping costs (as the item cost) make it expensive and irrelevant. I don't recommend shipping Amazon.
"The mobile experience is really bad. I load my search and it takes 30 second to a minute to load any results, and that's if my search goes through at all. There is an area of opportunity for the app developers to make optimise or remove programming that is causing severe lag."
"Over the years my experience with Amazon and specifically their shipping has gotten worse. They almost never accurately predict the arrival of your package. When they ship their own products instead of UPS, USPS or FedEx (via Amazon van or truck) you're now almost guaranteed to not get your items in time. They try so hard to be independent and not have to pay other carriers. Look what happens when you cheap out.. unhappy customers and unhappy workers."
"I'd been using Amazon Prime for a couple years, but when I moved and the Amazon Flex drivers became suddenly incompetent to follow my very clear, very precise delivery instructions, I went to customer service. I've had more interactions with customer service due to terribly delivery way more times than I am comfortable with in a very brief time. Twice I was offered a credit to maintain customer loyalty for these bad experiences. Both times I was then told they couldn't honor their promise."
"Opened and closed immediately. I hate the menu on the bottom, I thought it was just going to be the apple difference when I saw it on my husband's phone and now it's completely flipped. Ugh! It's a small stupid thing but man it can really impact the use experience."
"Just horrible. I have had nothing but bad experiences trying to order things from you people, I don't receive them. I don't get it what is your deal?! Amazon is the worst to shop as far as I'm concerned and your webpage is way too confusing when trying to contact customer service or find your problem I get taken in circles....Amazon is just a mess that's how I felt, and I will never try shopping through Amazon again. Ever."
"Simply horrible. It used to work at least decently. But over the last few months it keeps resetting every time I carry out a search. All this even though I didn't change anything in the setting of my cell. Maybe Amazon is too big to fail, but it certainly seems too big to care about its users' experience."
"Amazon, what on earth have you done to the app! The latest update is just plain cheap you clearly have stripped down to a Web based interface. I hate it, and I'm sure many will agree once they get round to using it. 1 Star for clearly cutting costs and making the experience feel cheap"
"This app made it even harder for me to track my packages ever since the update. It was not like this yesterday, I thought it was good as it was until it won't let me sign in just to track on my package or to ""enable cookies in defult browser"" which I do not understand what defult browser it is talking about. I tried my email and phone number and it still gives me the same result, very disapointed at this update, bring back the old interface and stop asking people to enable cookies."
"Amazon app is a horrible experience at times. It freezes and takes forever to load any product and all its sizes and colors. Every action there is lag and freezing. Very frustrating. I can normally get most of my Amazon shopping done still. And the app is still better than using the mobile website, which freezes worse."
"It's a mixed experience. I buy things that are inexpensive items and they work great and operate correctly. Then you can buy something expensive and it doesn't work brand new out of the box because they didn't want to give you all or the best parts. I'm amazed, surprised, and appreciative, of inexpensive items. It's a mixed experience. Their refund policy saves the buyer from a nightmare. However."
My experience as of late with this app has been very glitchy. One minute I'm reviewing a product description and then out of nowhere I get bounced back to my home screen. It doesn't even go back to search results. Then I have to restart my search all over again. Stuff like this makes me shop elsewhere.
Slow and cumbersome. Used to be better at loading. Subscribe and save items get cancelled by Amazon with very little explanation and the suggested alternatives are nothing like the original product. It's the same with their back up products. Amazon used to be an enjoyable shopping experience but now it's getting harder.
"Why offer up your data for Amazon in exchange for a worse interface than just using Firefox... It blocks my password app so I have to enter it manually every time, every time requires an email, and now they've added security so that when you click over to approve the login you can't reopen the app... This security is over the top and makes this app unusable, uninstalling.."
"I use it because don't have another option. I live abroad. Customer service is terrible, always there is at least one item late, not working or that doesn't even arrive. And they don't care. Have had so many bad experiences and customer service is so bad handling them that i have already assumed that something will go wrong every time i buy that i np longer complain."
"The site is choppy and unbalanced. Does not work well for shopping descriptions or options. Doesn't load completely or timely on android or pc. Not a very good shopping experience when you cant get options or descriptions on items. Items not labeled properly, if you could have a flea market shopping site this would be it. Like ebay but worse descriptions and information. Probably the same sellers though."
"I stay in shopping wit Amazon. It's really the only way to shop, it's got the lowest prices, and quickest deliverys and the description and photos of the items are spot on. I've only had 1 bad experience wit making a purchase thur Amazon and it ended up not being a big deal but the only issue was that I had ordered a new headlight light bulb and when I got it the box was literally smashed and looked like it had been thur a stampede of horses but by sum miracle my headlight was still good."
"Absolute worst experience ever. Used to love this and now it's cost me over $1000 on an $80 order. 21 overcharges on 7 items. I was charged 21 times for 7 items pushing what little was on my card into overdraft because your ""refunds rake 3-5 days"" while you pumbled me for charges and kept changing the amounts over and over again. Your customer support is completely useless and ""supervisors"" have the same power as someone who just put on their first headset. Worthless app buyer beware!!!!!!!"
"Overall, this app IS TERRIBLE. Yeah, sure you can buy stuff. But the whole interface looks like it's from ANDROID KEY LIME PIE or something. And when I want to add something to a list..hit the button once, twice, 5 times for the damned list screen to appear...all Amazon cares about is your money apparently."
"Couldn't filter price range, the interface is poor, complicated in a bad way for users. Sellers not listing as before on Souq. This is the worst experience and longest transition period ever feom two apps. Choices are limited and not clear as before, prices increased as well. Emails and questions, support team takes a month to be answered if ever answered. Contacted them on the 3rd of April, got a reply yesterday with an apology for being late, I won't buy from here anymore and don't recommend it"
"I've always had a good experience with amazon and i really enjoyed shopping on it. But just recently i've had the worst online shopping experience on it. I can't begin to describe how bad their customer service is. I emailed them about my issue and i received about 10 emails from them which all contradicted the other. No one understood my issue, or to be more precise, no one took the time to read my emails and to understand my issue so he can resolve it. I will never shop on amazon again."
"This is NOT user friendly, it is horrible! If anything the website should have been given a change because the app was great before. The color\option choice is all over the place now and now we can't even zoom in which was a very useful feature. Makes the online shopping experience annoying. Change it back, please!"
"It's impossible to narrow a search and filtering is next to useless. The user interface is confusing, especially payment methods. But, with Prime, it's a convenient way to buy. Some items are overpriced, so check elsewhere too."
Amazon is a big company that makes is money from this app and it's site. So if there where any issues making the app difficult to use or hard to read then they'll be fixed promptly. In my experience they prod a little to pay for Amazon Prime and if you have a little extra cash then it makes the experience better with a few other perks. The only problem is scammers can also sell you Prime so be careful on where you could find a deal on it. Happy shopping.
"overall shopping experience is great, broad selection and fast accurate shipping. I actually have very little problems considering the amount of items I've ordered. I have 4/5 stars only because of outsourced customer service. the language barrier is sometimes a pain in the a**"
"These past 3-4months have been a terrible experience on the app. Super buggy. Whenever I try to open a product photo it crashes, videos don't load, very slow app in general. Definitely makes me use it less ans therefore I buy less from here and look elsewhere. You're a huge company with so many resources, FIX THIS."
"I loved the separation between amazon prime now for groceries and the ""Amazon Shopping"" app for everything else..... They've decided to merge the two and what a miserable grocery shopping experience. Wal Mart managed to merge their apps but even within the merged app there is a separation between groceries and normal shopping which is appreciated."
The app is super stupid and annoying it is like the people who made it or trying so hard to not make the experience enjoyable for the customers which is very very very annoying. My problem with the app is I'm trying to secure my Amazon password but every time I try to keep shooting me down which is very annoying each time I keep trying more than over I've tried over 20 times and if you don't want to accept my password it keeps telling me to retry over and over it doesn't even deserve one star 😡
"2 Bugs and a Suggestion/Request Using Samsung Galaxy S10 (Snapdragon) Bugs: •I'm expirencing an issue with the application remembering the previously used ""Wish List"" to display in the bottom tray. •The app has also duplicated items from one wish list into other lists at seemingly random times. Request: •Please add a dark mode. It would enable a more cohesive experience when using with the S10's native dark mode."
"Amazon offer the best shopping experience! Amazon deserve not less than 5 stars! I see a lot of fake reviews of 1 star from competitors sellers. It's sad the way how they interact. Not appropriate at all. However, I use Amazon for more than 4 years always satisfied! Very good customer service. And if you are not satisfied with your shopping, Amazon always find a solution to makes you happy. Nothing less than 5 stars! Thank you!"
"Very poor experience. I would suggest a more minimalistic style on the app. The app constantly crashes despite the recent update and takes longer to load than eBay, unfortunate as I rely on Amazon but might have to switch overall. Very disappointing for a multi-billion dollar company."
"Unwanted algorithmic recommendations are right in your face on app homepage. Search is good if you know what you want, but basic browsing by category is now buried in the footer: click on the three bars, then scroll down until you see Shop by Department. Amazon is pushing algorithmic suggestions over customer usability, resulting in a highly negative shopping experience."
"Wow! So as many people have commented, there's been a major bug with the app affecting the view you see when you perform a search making it impossible to really navigate. I sent an email to the office of Jeff Bezos and within a day... It's been fixed. That shows that amazon does care, but they don't always have their eyes where they might find this kind of forum of feedback. Anyway, amazon support has always been great for me and of course the shopping experience has always been unrivaled!"
"New interface is harder to use and unfriendly to the hopping between items I used to enjoy. Can't go between check out and cart anymore, forces users to use the ""Back"" button a million times to get back to the cart from the preview checkout page. As a picky person, this is the pits. Hope they change it back!"
"Amazon Sucks!!! I ordered 4 items, less than 2 hours later realized it was going to my old address. I called to have it changed and was advised that Amazon cant change their own shipping standards for THEIR own carriers, but can request changes from UPS. Stupid. Then, the half English speaking reps cancelled my order even though I asked them not to. Never got my gift card refund or CC. They screwed that up as well, and just totally ruined my experience with them. I will NEVER shop Amazon again."
"Like the app, just had to deal with returns. Returns are a pain in the @** now. Our local option is UPS which has terrible hours! We can pay to do some sort of drop box deal. Kohls was 1000% better experience to return it. My family will be be shopping around now vs buying an item we are unsure of."
"I HATE shopping Prime Now items on the new interface they are trying to switch people too. I usually use prime now app and it Just shows Fresh and Whole Foods. you can't even shop between them (or SEARCH for a specific fresh/wf only item).., If they retire Prime Now I'm going to switch to shopping at Harris teeter. this was incredibly hard to shop for things you want delivered during a time window. it needs to filter do you can choose fresh and whole foods as two filters for your search."
"The app consistently crash. I attempted to order a few things and was charged 4x for 1 purchase. I've never had this issue in the past but for the past week I've had the worse experience. I updated the app, I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, and I updated my phone. This is a shame because I rest enjoyed the convince of shopping. I guess I'm on to a new shopping app."
"Whatever they did in their update has completely ruined my shopping experience with Amazon. If I want movies, I will go to the movie app for amazon. If I want books, I will go to the kindle books app for Amazon. When I want to shop for items, I will go to the shop app for amazon.....but the problem is I am not able to conveniently shop for anything anymore but instead am left browsing through movies and books and other things i would otherwise go to a different app for. It does not make sense."
"Really like the availability of selected US goods, and the prices. Sometimes you can get really good deals, delivery is prompt, interface is uncluttered.Do need to check out and compare multiple offers to pick the right ones. Only got disappointed with one dishonest seller during Covid that didn't deliver my heavy cast iron saucepan from US (free delivery listed by unable to fulfill)."
"It seems as if Amazon doesn't worry about the online shopping experience for customers because they have few competitors. App is messed up since update, search engine is worthless...I have items that don't show up in search results that I sometimes find by accident. The paid results are so so so annoying. Just let me shop."
"The app is a smoother experience than a mobile browser can offer, and being able to add to wishlists easier is great. However, the app seems to flip flop between allowing you to filter by set price ranges to pre-set ranges. I would like to CONSISTENTLY be able to filter by my own custom ranges."
"Frustrating experience. Filter screens don't appear to have back button facility. This necessitates use of the phone back button which clears the search. Latest version, I don't recall this being an issue before. Downgrading from 3 to 2.a truly unpleasant experience."
"I payed to try the one day delivere on (amazon prime) and it was the worst experience ever. I place an order and it was delivered on the wrong adress. Later I re-oder my item and the delivery truck couldnt enter to deliver the package ""due to missing imformation"" which was provided before hand. I talk to customer service like four times and they said that I was going to receive the package later the same day and it wasn't true. I never got my package! so is not worth paying for prime."
Worst experience I have ever had with any kind of shopping application. I have ordered and paid by card with extra amount for same day delivery but after 2 days the are still tracking my item. And recieved a mail from customer service that they might get to different address because of that it wasn't delivered. Never expected this kinda service from such a reputable org.. finally I am so frustrated that I don't even want my money back and will uninstall Amazon all services including prime..
"One sentence? Here you go: Annoying shopping experience! - insufficient and very cumbersome filtering - CHAOS on search results page - too little searched products, too much all other information; very messy, eyesore - 80% of products I search for, cannot be delivered from Germany to Switzerland - why even bothering showing those? To annoy me even more? So currently I use Amazon Shop as ""ideas mine"" - and then I go to other shops.I've just searched for specific messenger bag and it was a pain..."
I'm very happy with my experience in your Amazon shopping app anytime I've had a discrepancy or had to return something they've always been extremely helpful and the returns have always been easy I'm very happy to keep using this app to continue to buy my products I don't think you can go wrong especially if you are over 65 and have what it takes to get to $6.95 per month it's a great benefit especially if you only need one or two items that are just a few dollars well worth it
"Sadly, I have had nothing but bad experiences with Amazon delivery and have deleted the app. Deliveries NEVER show up at my correct address. They can't seem to correct this mistake even after hours on the phone with an Amazon rep. Their delivery drivers are awful. After repeated attempts to use the company have failed, i will no longer waste my time or money. AMAZON has been the Worst experience."
"Love Amazon, and have always had great experiences and great customer support. Until recently, a purchase i made some months back for a tablet that didn't work. Contacted support after seller and was told it would be handled and yet it's been well over a month and morning?? Living Life and being a single dad, i stay pretty busy!! And i didn't think with Amazon I'd have to stay on top of you to fix this problem. But now I've reached out and I'm getting no assistance."
Amazon took a order for a item I placed that only has one in stocks. Half way through they turned around and said that they canceled my order. Stating my payment method was not going though. Although it went through when I bought it . . . And I can not even recover the money back which is 50 dollars. This is the worst experience I've had with a app.
"Loved my old menu setup. New update placed the menu on the bottom, much preferred it on the top left. This new setup is garbage! Seems like a silly thing to complain about but the ""flow"" of an app can really make or break the experience."
"Really bad experience. The products are so random, sold by random shops, and you dont even k ow the rating for the shop unless you go through a heap of clicks to reach the page with their rating. Most of them are really bad ratings, too."
Very bad experience. I made an order for books ..the transaction is doubled (not the bank( but because the shipping fees tripled without any reason ..then tried to cancel it ..not accept cancellation ..dont know why...it was just few minutes later of course not shipped yet or even assembled. Now i have to pay about 3 times the price of the book for no reason
"This app is clunky, frustrating, and slow. Whether it's between info not displaying correctly, to crashes (on my Pixel 4XL), to just how slow and confusing it is to browse product listings, reviews, and essentially everything you need for a good shopping experience. Many times I just swap to my computer after failing with the app."
"Everyone knows how convenient, fast, and great user experience is on Amazon but here are two huge problems. 1. The sheer amount of waste. Heard from reputable sources that returns are all thrown away (you know they hand those out like candy, which i love and hate), plus the ridiculous amount of ill-sized packaging! 2. Reputability of reviews and products. Even good products from real brands somehow send shittier stuff through Amazon somehow!"
UH-OH something went wrong on our end. Had this for months everytime I click on a listing. The other parts of the app work fine but if I can't look at a listing then the app is useless...terrible app experience and wouldn't reccomend to anyone until they fix the issue.
"It has to be said, Amazon have become many people's ""go to"" shopping experience. There are occasional issues, but I have always found that with an email or two they are always resolved to the customers satisfaction. 30 years ago it was Argos that led the way with their enormous catologue range giving people a huge choice of quality and costs , unfortunately they failed to move with the times and have become a shadow of their former potential . Amazon , the encylapedia of shopping !"
What in L did you do to this app?. Completely broke a perfectly good interface so things are now harder to find. WHY? WHY? WHY? change it back. This sux. Search? Good luck. They now have an autocorrect feature that won't allow me to search for a vendor named FUGEN because it automatically changes it to DUGAN. Thanks amazon for frustrating your customers.
"I was pestered with adding X amount of money to get FREE delivery. 1st day there were no available deliveries, nor on the 2nd day. On the 3rd there were a FEW ""windows"" (deliveries) available, for which I had to pay because two items were no longer available, and I had to add another X amount for free delivery. I tripled an item and went to checkout (20 secs) and there were no ""windows"" available. If you are a chronic gambler, try this Whole Foods shopping experience; you might enjoy it."
"Awful new interface. How did this get released as an improvement over the previous version? I placed an order using the recently updated interface and whenever I go back to my basket, it says ""processing payment"" even though I'm not going through checkout. I'll stop using the app now and just use the web interface. Sad that they've taken something familiar, which worked well and screwed it up."
"Really confusing user interface. I had to look up how to access Messages so that I could follow up an order. Also, status of orders should be shown on one page rather than having to click into each order to see their statuses. Amazon's UI team could take a page out of eBay's UI team's interface."
"It's inconvenient to use. I can't understand in the local language of the country I live in, why I can't use another interface language even for the application system settings. Even English is not supported. At the first order, it was written that the delivery for the first order is free, but when paying, it automatically subscribes to the prime tariff, which implies paying extra money. Given that the system works in the local language, the terms of use remain unclear."
"The app has been helpful for Convenience of shopping, quick delivery and easy returns. I do experience issue with glitches and resistance when scrolling through my wish list sometimes, I hope that gets fixed because it only started about 2 months ago or that's when I noticed it. overall, amazing app."
"The new UI is terrible and it kills the user experience. I'm contemplating giving up my prime because of how awful it is to use now. The app itself is also extremely buggy, giving errors on the most mundane uses. I've seen the pretty dog saying something went wrong far too often in the last few days. This is definitely not Amazon's best work, but the old app wasn't broken - so it obviously needed to be replaced."
My experience with Amazon is really frustrating. I have already given a reason and I was cut short on the app. Why do Amazon delivery people say they attempted delivery when they have not. Total liars cracks me up. Dontnknow why I bother with Amazon. They should get their act together and sort out a better way of telling them customers problems. Also are they having a laugh with their ratings. My order was attempted yesterday at 6. 30 to my p/office its shut @ 5. 30 tried today but failed 🙄
"Amazon has really gone down hill, I have been a prime member for years, but my recent experience with them has been just awful. I order an prime product on Dec 20th, and it took them 2 weeks to just ship, I ordered another product that is prime and they won't deliver it until the 10th, that Amazon prime two day shipping for you. Honestly you can buy a product thats not prime and get it before the prime shipping and at cheaper cost, and without the $15 monthly fee. I canceled my prime membership."
The newest update has ruined the shopping experience for me on the app. I don't understand the point of moving the search bar to the bottom of the screen. Maybe I should be happy because the new UI is so off putting I find myself spending less time on the app and shopping less. 🤷
Amazon has the slowest return policy I have ever experienced! If you get a bad product they are just as bad in their part. They provide the label but then nothing is tracked on their end. Mine shows they already have in their possession with ups but they show nothing no shipping return update just sits nonupdated and when contact them you get nowhere!
"WTH has happened? Update on 28Oct2019 has slowed the experience way down, app hangs reguarly, taken back to home page often in middle of searching / shopping. Looking for older version in my backups. If I experienced this when started using Amazon, I never would have stuck with it. Garbage!"
"Since the new design with tabs at the bottom was implemented, the app has been noticeably slower than before. The disappearing side menu on the left would make the experience much snappier... and was just fine, you didn't really have to change it..."
Rogers has installed its version of this app over the original app I had installed and now it doesn't work properly. Can't delete it and install the proper app as rogers has locked out this app leaving me with the only option to disable. Thank you rogers for running another app experience.
"Worst experience with an app I've ever had I have always had my password memorized and username memorized in my phone after installing this app it keeps warning me that I was in some other part of the country which would change quite often I deleted the app and everything went back to normal again, the app gets lost at best and can't remember anything including passwords it repeatedly sent me emails telling me to change my password, as in every single time I logged in so annoying that I deleted"
"it has the worst shopping experience ever, it keeps coming up with about 50 different stupid recommendations as sub categories on a certain category instead of just one full category and then it rarely ever has the option of being able to filter prices or filter it in anyway I want. don't get me wrong it has a large variety of shopping available just the experience is absolutely terrible."
"Updated version sucks (5/17/21) All they managed to do was take up screen space at bottom and top now. Please allow option to hide ridiculous features, and banner bars (hole foods, fresh, in-store code, Alex lists, Prime, video, music, really!?) let's call your new look crapple and the old version Android. Apple interface is so dumbed down. Why would I need to know where it's being shipped to while searching, that's handled during checkout."
"Excellent online shopping experience. Simply the best online shopping apps with outstanding services & delivery. Unfortunately after latest updates, the apps seems not compitable with my Pocophone F1. uninstalled the apps, then after trying to reinstall the apps it had failed to do so until this moment. What a disappointment"
I generally have a very positive experience with the app except in the last two days I can no longer buy books for my Kindle. I keep getting some kind of an error message saying that Google is not allowing people to buy books from the app. You have to create a playlist and then go to your computer desktop and somehow transfer them to your phone from the desktop I don't see how that works. This is a bad and backward situation. What is the point of having an app on your phone if you can't use it
I love this app. I buy many products from Amazon. I can compare prices from home. I have no problem loading my pages. To have a great shopping experience with the Amazon app. people need a good update computer or tablet. If your device it's old it will be slow loading the app. and you are going to be disappointed.
Its the best shopping experience on earth. The only that can make it better are options to increase the number of items per page and advanced filtering options/features becuase there are a whole lot of options available for everything.
Love Amazon !!!! They have a new icon..inspire. we can look at video shorts of real reviews from since really great products people actually use. I love it !!! Only problem I've experienced is not being able to see where my delivery is. Unless it's literally on it's way. Other than that THANK YOU AMAZON 😀
No like. I prefer Web page experience the app is too guided
"What an horrible experience with German amazon, the team giving false promise to solved the problems in 2 days and keep delayed for more and more 2 days, been wasting whole week for no reason! It's kinda funny, indeed that i made an order that is high value in first time, so they must make sure i'm legit pay for it. But the 30€ order????? They can't even make it too? Just how horrible is this services is? The support team is useless."
This is the wort experience I ever had with an app in my life. Dark theme is all messed up and unusable. Everything is so hard to find and if you communicate with a sellers and have many communications at the same time there is no way you can see what product you are talking about. Not a problem if you ask a question to one seller but if you looking for something special and ask a lot of sellers the same question when you get replays you will not know what product exactly it is.
"I've been a loyal Amazon Prime member for years, paying monthly for the promise of fast, reliable deliveries. However, my recent experiences have been nothing short of frustrating. Despite pre-ordering items, my shipments have been consistently delayed. It seems Amazon no longer understands the concept of ""pre-order"" - a promise to deliver a product on its release day. I've come to feel as though my Prime Membership, which I pay for each month, is purposefully neglected. Rectify the issue Jeff"
"Dark mode not supported. The largest retailer on Earth can't get their developers to implement a feature that almost every other app supports. That's just a poor customer experience. Worse still, if we force dark mode with developer settings, the text boxes are unreadable."
I liked how stores on here have great selections on items for good prices. I like how this app recommends me items for things I want. The only issue is ordering because it is hard to pay on this app. Shipment is quicker than a lot of other apps. There are different catagories to see what stuff is in style for the season. There is a simple interface for looking for items and it is modern. It is awesome for looking for new clothing or accessories! The best part is discounts on useful daily items..
"Since I can't find any feedback option in the app (what a surprise, worlds shittest company won't accept feedback), I'll put it here. What is the point of storing payment methods when if you want to switch between them you have to verify the whole card number AGAIN? Isn't the point of a password and security on your account to protect against the kind of abuse you're attempting to prevent by making customers confirm their card number? Terrible user experience = amazon"
"Worst app ever. Absolutely no care about user experience. It such a pitty that in 2022 having such possibilities you don't care doing anything better. Such a complicated app with nested menus, submenus whatever...it takes tones of time and effort to find what you want and do what you want. Try for instance signing out. Takes some time till you give up trying."
"Ever since they brought buying books for comixology here, it's a much much MUCH smaller selection of comics and much harder to find. The filters still initially try to make you buy the paperback version first as well. Hope they figure this out soon as several months have gone by and it's completely ruined the comic experience."
I just updated my application on Aug.26 2020 and I hated this update !!! It's not compatible with my cellphone screen at all !! I have to scroll right and left to bw able to see one single listing and listings appear side by side not a single listing per row as it was before !!! Please bring back the previous interface
"Horrible Experience. Lost access to thr phone on file and the password, ended up calling customer service and they said my account is dormant and can no longer access the account, to top it all off gift cards were put on account upwards to $50 and they won't credit me for my money or help me out in any way. Again, horrible experience"
"What an awesome service, I've been purchasing variety of items. Each time amazon has met with my expectations, amazon is genuinely care about customer satisfaction and will provide you an instant assistance if you face any problems. I truly recommend amazon for every individual who wants to experience an quick delivery. I got an instant replace order, after my package has been lost. I did not need wait more than 5 minutes to communicate with an agent. Great experience with amazon so far."
"The interface color change and getting rid of lightning deals is somewhat annoying. I enjoyed the randomness of it. Now it feels much more search oriented. Which I suppose is good for most. Dispite those minor annoyences, it's still the best place to shop online for everything!"
"Worst experience I've ever encountered!! I got an echo show 10 a couple of months ago as a gift from my son, well having had an echo 8 in which I really loved I thought the echo show 10 would be great but it wasn't! It had problems from the beginning. Well, after 3 phone calls and lots of frustration they sent me a refurbished one in a different color instead of a new one!! It even had a white powdery substance embedded in the speaker(flour) unacceptable! They said to buy another one !"
Timing is everything. On time and items delivered with care always in my experience.
"Life long Amazon Customer and user of their Prime Membership because shipping to Hawaii can be so much more costly than the low price they charge annually since everything is flown via Air Mail (charged by weight) unlike the Continental US where it is all driven by large transportation trucks. I've been buying from Amazon since its online inception and my experience w/ this app is my life line to the very best products, information of products and allows an easy comparison of said products for the lowest possible costs. I would recommend this app as it is exactly the same as their website yet so much simpler to use!"
"My experience is getting worse. I used to trust Amazon but now they're flooded with shady sellers and product that ship from random places. Import duties, extra taxes and other stuff is not properly calculated and sometimes you will be asked to pay extra ludicrous amounts in the most cumbersome and insecure ways. Even AliExpress has this figured out already, I thought Amazon was more trustworthy but it isn't the case"
"Newest update: WHY is the search bar on the bottom?! Please - stop with the constant changes to the User Interface. Updates are fine when streamlining, but this isn't one of those necessary changes. Latest update no longer shows the seller's customer service rating when you click/select seller's name in ”SOLD BY” section of product. I'd like to know what consumer's experienced with the product's seller. Knowing the seller's rating is important before I make any purchase."
"Clicking on an amazon link from google/chrome doesn't display the product because the app isn't open in the background. So I have to manually open the app, go back to google/chrome and then re-clicl the product link. This part of the user experience is worse than if I didn't have the app at all. For that, 1 star."
"APP POOR QUALITY & GLITCHES Product pictures & options >100s to load. Random blank areas/links on product pages: header, title, link to brand/store, product options, cost & color. Used product page doesn't load all options. Time is $ AMZ. I go to grocery, department & brand stores in apps/online more than AMZ now for better shopping experiences & better products, so I don't waste time or $. AMZ got too big too fast. Now you can't keep up with quality or standards. AMZ you've jumped the shark."
I have been an Amazon customer for 17 years. I started by buying books in college. Over the last six month I have noticed that they have started to treat everyone poorly. The merchants their employees and even their customers. They have changed their policy to having to return most items that have arrived damaged or even if you order something and it doesn't show and have them replace it. If the item still shows you are responsible for returning the item or you get charged for both. I had a horrible experience today with customer service and trying to get a shipping label. UPS has to bring one to my door in order for me to return it. I currently have a house full of people with COVID and choose to have it picked up from my house to avoid human contact and yet I still have to talk to someone to receive a label I could normally print off at home because my package arrived with the products inside not packaged correctly and broken. The customer service person was not helpful and didn't really listen to what I was saying and kept repeating herself without actually answering the question. I am so frustrated I want to cancel my Prime membership. I feel like the company should be more cooperative and there should be a way for us to prove something is damaged without having to return a broken product to the warehouse. I get that they want to resell a bunch of their returns. But honestly is it worth putting UPS and USPS through all that when they are only the middle men? It seems such a waste of resources. Guess Amazon won't be winning any sustainability awards anytime soon!!!
"the video playing while shopping for things kept getting in the way of finding what I wanted to buy. Otherwise fine, but I can block that autoplay nuisance in the browser, so that experience is better for finding what I need."
"This app is terrible now. Doesn't allow for sharing wishlists anymore, poor user interface, glitches, freezing up everything I open the app, on top of that Amazon as a company has really gone down hill and their prime membership doesn't even offer 2 day shipping anymore!! so whats the point!!!?? So disappointed in their product selection, shipping, customer service and their shady pricing!! Its all a big scam!!"
"could be better. The choice to remove search by category in the mobile app is really frustrating. I have to revert to use the desktop website to be able to browse the categories I am interested in. Also, the red App Badge shows ""1"" notification, but there seems to be nothing in the app, and I can't make it go away. Using the website is a much better experience, would be good to have a good experience on the go too, but the mobile app is just meh."
Worst experience with Amazon grocery shopping. Driver doesn't even have the courtesy to call and look for address. Ordered twice and same experience. Groceries were never delivered. Never trust Amazon grocery to deliver ur grocery items on time. Will never ever use it again. Walmart and instacart are much better than this.
"Good app, but worst ever update to it's app icon. While the experience has been improving its been offset by few issues. The return policy is not what it used to be and the returns been becoming difficult with every passing year. Have also hit service delays with absurd explanations from customer service."
"been an Amazon prime customer for years, but with recent updates and changes to the app and shopping experience overall, that may soon change. I rarely utilize the prime video feature so with the shopping becoming a bigger hassle (click next page after only viewing 18 items?!) I might as well save my money."
I had a worst ever experience with Amazon. I was compelled to pay for a product returned but misplaced by Amazon pick up guy due to flaws n Amazon app. For no verification required the picture of product being picked up doesn't show. Three products were returned but for one product till date after 3 months there was no resolution and Amazon went on raising investigation tickets and finally said they trust their pick up boys and not the prime customer who has been a prime customer for 10+ years.
"Don't believe the reviews!! I've written several truthful reviews when I've received poor products, but Amazon just screens them out and deletes them. If something doesn't arrive, you're expected to chase the courier yourself. Could you imagine if you went to a high street shop, something broke during the warranty, and then had to contact the manufacturer directly. There's much more focus on tax free profit than high quality, safe products and costumer experience."
"I enjoy browsing and discovering new things I never knew existed, but I love to shop, and have found everything I've ever searched for on Amazon. There's nothing that Amazon doesn't offer, and at very competitive but affordable prices, as well as prompt customer service and delivery. Amazon does a great job anticipating the needs of shoppers, along with offering an abundance of options to provide their customers with the best shopping experience possible."
I don't trust as I had a bad experience with Amazon after I ordered 3 boxes of hand vinyl gloves. Now after 8 weeks my orders were not available and even orders were not returned for refund. I cancelled my account with Amazon and gave a bad review as well. They were delaying the delivery and not responding. I will not recommend this to anyone until I get a refund or return.
"Excellent shopping experience, you could probably purchase anything you are looking for, variety of quality to choose from, and the delivery is always super fast, on top of that the return is unquestionably easy and free if the item you received is not as good as described or something wrong with it, try Amazon, you will love it."
"Too many problems, I normally get the 6 code in my phone number text, but they didn't give it to me this time, because of this I had to waste 40 minutes in customers service,and had to switch 3 operators to tell me how else I get the code. The app is too wordy for a bilingual, and too confusing to work with. This also ruined my first experience of using Amazon prime."
"I've started using this over the website through my laptop. Bought various bits and pieces through here, and haven't had a single problem so far. No bugs, no glitches. Overall content with the experience and would recommend it for fast and convenient shopping 3/5 🌟"
"Terrible experience after the latest update. Now is way more difficult to navigate and pretty much the app is now focused on showing you articles you are not looking for. Additionally the menus for the settings are way less intuitive. Please, come back to the web base experience, way much better than this app"
"They wrecked their filter options, can't look at just what's a current deal or on sale or filter by price or stars etc. Very unhelpful! Where is dark mode? Have only ever experienced minor tech issues, search bar makes you delete and type each time. But really the filter options disappearing is a big hit."
"Ridiculously amateurish, I find it hard to believe that this is the official app of the world's leading e-commerce company. When you try to filter for results, you cannot choose multiple criteria at once, but rather have to go back over and over again to add a new filter. And this is one of the many things that add to a poor user experience."
"Dear Amazon, if I am part of some A/B trial for a new interface, please allow me to vote NO and go back to the old design. The new one has no logic. There is no discernable difference between the account sub menu (person icon) or the settings menu (hamburger). You seem to realise this as you duplicate much of the same content on both. And departments are listed with the settings, rather than shop front? Madness I tell you! A sad step back in usability."
It is ridiculous that the world's largest company cannot get a freaking out right. No matter how many times I try to see my previous orders it just refresh is over and over and over again without ever populating the field so that I can see my orders. Everything that is about this app is way more difficult then it needs to be. The most horrible experience I have had on a app in a while
Never really had problems or a hard time using the app till recently. App has not been working right anymore its acting buggy and on multiple devices so i know something is wrong with the app. Deffinently needs and update focused on a more functional user interface. Please fix this! This is my main source of shopping.
"When it does not work smoothly, the Amazon experience is horrendous. I received several dates when the item did not come, only to subsequently find out the item is ""unavailable"". I sought and received six email addresses to directly file a customer complaint. None accepted the email; Amazon has no mechanism to receive a complaint in writing; the system is designed to disallow every effort. In light of the excruciating aggravation, Amazon gave me a $5.00 credit for this horror."
Horrible UI. The search bar on the bottom is the worst thing I have ever experienced in an app. It interfere with phone keyboards and the menu. The fact that the Amazon app team refuses to acknowledge the mistake makes it worse.
Move the search bar back up to the top... Nobody asked for it to be on the bottom. Or give users the choice. The Fresh part of the app is slow and buggy when going through a long list of items in the cart - very poor experience.
"Still prefer browser based Amazon website. Apps steel your liberty through EULA and control your user experience. There are areas on an items page I want to zoom in on and the app prevents this. Also, I find better deals through my browser search & can't seem to find the exact same items offered in the app without directly searching by ASIN. Had to erase the PRO's of using the app as its too invasive."
Ever since i ordered my first product every thing is going well at the beginning but once its dispatched after few days its automatically getting return not even mentioning the reason the products are returned and money is refunded. Our neighbors are receiving products via flipcart. Have ordered almost 10 times. Not even 1 delivered. Very bad experience
"I use Amazon for purchases daily, and having next page option has ruined the experience and made it more time consuming to scroll and wait for the next page to load! extremely fristrating! I'm a prime member as well and have been using the app for years without problems until now. Fix it! I will shop elsewhere if it is not fixed. Im in a household of five so that will also be a lot of business lost!"
"Terrible experience. App works well, however amazons tracking information didn't work with the companies website, and email support is unavailable for an unknown reason. No way to find out if I'm getting my packages or if I'm getting scammed. Terrible customer support, will recommend paying a couple dollars extra to local business, as they actually care"
"huge fan of Amazon and this service(not a huge fan of what they have done to my home town of Issaquah, WA with them making it impossible to live here with increasing the cost of living to make me move) but I'm very upset with them making me switch apps. the previous app was way more smooth, easy to use and looked nicer, it seems like I'm taking a huge step back with this new app. I'll be looking elsewhere until the user experience is improved."
"Worst shopping experience ever. They make you chat with a robot. My order was supposed to be delivered on 22 November but never came and was postponed to 4 December then 5 December,and when I contacted the courier company they said they never received it. they insisted I write an incident report and they'll refund it even after I told them several times I don't want a refund I just need the product. I even suggested they use a different courier or something . A whole month of my life wasted!"
Better ways to shop. The amount of unrelated junk that shows up in your search is almost as bad as Ali Express. My last experience with Amazon was a bad one. They sent the wrong item so there's clearly no quality control. Will be removing this and never spending money with Amazon again.
"Used to like the app. She I can't buy digital content/ books here anymore ""to comply with Google play guidelines). As I use Amazon for Kindle content mainlyakes it pointless for me. Also, the interface changed a while back, it's more of a pain to navigate than it used to be I find personally."
"I give this only 2 stars, not totally because the app itself, but for Amazon, they rarely have good deals, that is if you compare prices on Amazon to ebay, I shop ebay and get things I want way cheeper, also this app needs to be improved, it's slow and freezes alot, user interface and navigation is poor, Amazon plz improve your self and your company, I love you Amazon but for the love of pet, plz expand your buying choices for us, and plz fix and improve your app,"
"The new interface is unintuitive and stupid. Why move the search bar to the bottom? Finding certain setting now takes double the effort. The app was good enough before, but the development team had nothing valuable to add so they decided to change what was already working."
"App should use device's language. Amazon Prime should make it clear that Amazon Photos are not included outside the USA. Amazon Prime should make it clear that Amazon Videos is a scam that will still ask for more money for every other film or later series' seasons even though you already pay monthly. Free shipping is worthless if you can find domestic platforms that are cheaper WITH shipping. Usability is good. Interface is pleasant. Need dark mode, though"
"New format is junk. It appears to be moving the browsing experience towards an advertising platform as opposed to a product search platform. another step in the same direction I'll just uninstall the damn thing and browse on the web instead. Maybe the pagination was added for performance reasons, but it feels trashy and geared towards ad serving. I haven't used it that much yet, but they were also a bunch of products I didn't have anything to do with what I was actually searching for."
"Amazon is a smooth shopping experience for me, and has had excellent customer service any of the times that I have had any kind of an issue, whether it was an item ordered, food order, or electronic order(shows or channel subscriptions on prime video), they have always given my concern prompt attention, and resolved the issue to my liking before making sure there was not anything else I needed! I also appreciate the fact that because I get SNAP, they give me a discount on prime membership!"
The app has been good but ever since the last update it kind of leaves the app almost completely broken. You can search for items but other than that most of the user experience is no longer working and the practical tools to simply look at your list or track an order is no longer working.
"Amazon as a site is just generally flawed. From frequent 'issues' that make you unable to cancel items, forcing you to wait 'a few minutes' that then turn into a few hours and a few days until suddenly the item is at your door and you need to pay for it, to an annoying and awkward interface that makes you delve through several different tabs just to find what you're looking for. It's a mid at best online shopper, and barely a step up from Ebay."
only rarely had a problem with delivery drivers not following instructions. but I'm 90% please with my experience.
"The app is just fine, all the same accessibility as on full desktop site. However the updated user interface is oversimplified and feels chunky, massive deadspace between the main tabs and for whatever reason the font is gigantic in the search tab and the side menu's"
"Amazon has created one of the worst shopping experiences on any app. Their newest update now auto plays videos as you preview merchandise, causing not only an annoying experience but also an app that consumes data like crazy and for any people experiencing visual based disorders like epilepsy this app is now unusable. Quite simply this app should have an option to turn off ad videos and preview videos until then i hope everyone will boycott the app and rate it accordingly with a one star."
"The app is gradually getting worse with each update, but the service itself is even worse. When I select a more expensive product just because its delivery is advertised as next day, or ""tomorrow before 1pm"", then you shouldn't be changing this after the purchase has been made. And it's not an isolated incident, as I experienced that with nearly all of my orders I made in recent weeks. Any other company would face a backlash from customers if they were changing the terms of contacts such way."
New interface is a downgrade from the old design. It is unintuitive and difficult to navigate for no good reason. Another issue is prompts to sign up for prime during checkout or prime shipping being highlighted instead of standard shipping.
"First of all, adding an amazon shopping search in my android interface for my word selection is ludicrous. Second, trying to uninstall the app you guys hid the option and I had to go all the way into the android settings. If you're being this intrusive I'm removing the app."
"Terrible ergonomy. It's surprising how terribly designed this is. They force their prime option down your throat constantly, without allowing you to select a classic shipping option afterward. I canceled an order, yet the site still tells me I already ordered it once when I tried to order it again. Peak bad user experience, I don't recommend."
"Not as happy as I was with the Amazon of 10 years ago, but it's still the best online shopping experience out there EDIT: new upgrade, the inner that moved the home and cart business to the bottom of the screen seems to have made the app sluggish where it used to easily load, and unable to even get to my cart at times."
"I love shopping at Amazon. Never (fingers crossed!) have had a bad experience, and I have bought many different items from Amazon. I have been able to find many items and/or accessories that were no longer available or were no longer stocked in the local stores where I live. Buying used books has saved me a ton of $$$! All purchases have been as described and arrived when promised. I am extremely satisfied with Amazon. I would give 10 stars if I could! 😊"
I usually have good experiences with Amazon I've never really had any big trouble. Until this last time when I needed a refund on something and when I had a refund before as soon as they as soon as I dropped off the item they issued refund. This time they got the item 5 days ago and are now telling me it could be up to two weeks before I can get a refund. I told them I didn't even care if it was as credit I just the refund
"The last 2 updates have all but ruined my shopping experience. The lagging and freezing up, not to mention that half of the things I look at won't totally load or let me look at the choices of colors or products is getting to be riddiculous. It's becoming a hassle to even try to shop."
"Horrible user experience and countless bugs. It hurts to use this app when I need to. Let alone the poor UX, now we have ads in the app. I must say this is not a brilliant idea. And lastly, the search engine and filters don't work properly. This app has one of the worst e-commerce feelings I have ever seen."
"Absolutely awful app. There user interface is at times so frustrating i throw away my phone to use my PC instead. Plus it's so awful that the app freezes for next to no reason, unlike other apps. I recommend avoiding the app and just going on a laptop when possible, it's probably more time effective than to struggle with this garbage"
"Upon entering logging into the app foe the first time, it offers a choice to activate amazon prime. The interface is set up in such a way as to make you accidentally click on activate prime. There is no way to cancel the activation. This is legal, of course, but not much different from fraud."
"Overall, wonderful experience. Very pleased with team's ability to always meet or beat (usually beat) estimated delivery times. Only wish one improvement could be made with app: often get new notification banners from AZ right on my home screen right next to the icon, but when opening the app, no further banners or directions are given as to where go next to see the nature of the notification. Is it Your Orders? Is it Your Lists? Is it Your Account? Just seems like a glitch🤷🏽‍♂️☹️"
"byzantine experience. first Amazon enforces no contact delivery, now on most items contact is mandatory. After you purchase through the app, Amazon holds your package hostage using the app to enforce additional steps before releasing it. You must speak personally to the driver on high dollar items (250 dollars ain't high dollar) long story short, the app makes shopping more complex. Delete the app save thousands."
"They have millions of products. They have millions of vendors. They con you in by claiming, ""free 2-day delivery"" on prime eligible items. But in my experience, I have never received an item in less than 7 days. I have always kicked myself because e-bay usually has the same thing a little bit cheaper. Or Walmart. Com . It doesn't make me feel like giving them 5 stars. Funny thing is this isn't Christmas season. It's technically slow season here in March......"
"Hey, rather than screw up the app, try fixing all of your problems with fake reviews, search results manipulation, fraudulent listings, and illegitimate companies plaguing your marketplace. Why is there is no way to turn off the Inspire tab in the Amazon app? I would really like a tweak that can permanently disable it. I keep accidentally hitting it when checking orders or account settings. My experience is worse after the updates."
"I am overwhelmed by the number of wrong orders i had to return since souq has become amazon The number of times that I ordered something and turned out something different from what the title or description said or the photo is daunting. The user experience especially the filter is barely useable. I remember writing about ""souq is now amazon"" on a well known online blog and how i was excited about it, but now ai regret it. I'm switching to noon and jumia."
"I used to be a die hard amazon fan because they were so far ahead in terms of customer experience. Since Bezos stepped down it's slowly just got worse and worse. I also can't believe that they still have no Google pay or PayPal integration. I'm slowly buying more elsewhere, I've cancelled prime and I'm almost ready to uninstall."
"Not sure what happened. But, I pay for Amazon Prime and would get the next delivery. I love it. Not, sure what happened along the road. Now, when I order I do not get that sam experience. I love all the other benefits it has like Amazon Prime Video. Now, when I order I do not get my packages until later. For example, I order something and yes it was for Amazon Prime delivery. Order it Friday, will not be here until next week Thursday almost a week later. Not happy."
ordered an iPhone 12 mini Friday and a few other things on amazon. It was under amazon renewed. This was my first time ordering from amazon and i will say my experience has been awful. i will never again buy anything from them. Customer service is awful i recieved no help after contacting. After getting my order confirmation email i was told my account was locked. I cant even see when my orders are coming. I got 1 package but what about the rest. Idk. Were the others canceled they wont tell me.
"Laughable experience,after 1+month with no delivery on 2 orders and 2 chats with Amazon regarding the issue(and 2 x prompts to...wait until the delivery period expires for both orders) i find myself amazed by the disappearance of the chat option from my account,the only option left to me now is to pay extra and buy an international package for my mobile in order to call to UK and request the refunds...""world's most customer friendly"" lol, great experience having to call abroad ,won't you agree?"
"The review is specifically for app, worst app now. The moment you switch windows for OTP the app screen get reset and went back to home. The order automatically come as placed with no option to revise payment. Amazon shopping is great but the app interface is worst."
Always some wack update that changes the interface. Especially irritated with the recent bottom search bar location moved from top. No app needs to be changed periodically like this. Can't stand it.
"Awful experience. Was prompted to download and purchase through the app to receive a 20$ off coupon code that would be ""automatically applied"". This coupon was never applied. I was lied to. Customer service then told me there was no such promotion or coupon. This was a BAIT AND SWITCH. Ugly on you amazon."
"Given the size and value of Amazon, I can only guess that the second rate interface and controls (e.g. filters, sorting etc) are deliberate. No doubt people buy more stuff this way. 🤷🏻‍♂️"
"Frequently crashing, almost always slow to load. Constantly changing the interface to the point that the app is finicky and a pain in the butt to use. Wouldn't bother saying it if it weren't driving me up the wall."
"As far as I'm concerned, Amazon app is essential for to all aspects of your daily living. Amazon, don't leave home without it. It's everything at your fingertips. The interface and functionality is easy. Customer service is accommodating and aim to resolve problems. I used the Amazon app for everything, even at critical points in my life and they delivered. Sometimes on the same day or within hours. They've sought every problem I had and compensated for mistakes made."
"app has a lot of glitches and for them upping the membership fees I feel like the experience should be better, but I just always have issues. I'm really at the point where I want to cancel and just drive myself to the store or order from another site."
I a having the worst experience with trying to place an order. this app is not allowing me to go back to my shopping cart and add something that was left out of my order. I want to order from my mainframe and not the cell. please allow a customer to buy on other systems and not just from cells.
I downloaded it three days ago and literally have not been able to use it. It keeps saying 'oops page not found'. I have uninstalled and reinstalled it. I have connected to wifi. I have full bars. Nothing is working. Horrible experience
"I don't know what happened but now I can't even see the Next button. I search for anything and I'm stuck with only one page of results because the interface is huge and cuts off everything. I can't scroll to where the ""next"" button at the bottom should be. I've uninstalled and reinstalled many times. I'm at a loss."
I've been an Amazon customer since they were known for selling books. My last experience with them was horrendous and insulting. I ordered a book a week and a half before I needed it for a training program and got a package on Friday. There was nothing inside. I contacted customer support and explained that I needed the materials by that Wednesday and that it was important. A few days later I got 2/3 books. They gave me two months free membership. Can't cancel because I'd lose access to media.
Highly recommend the Amazon Shopping app based upon my positive shopping experiences which have included accurate order processes and reliable services. It's very helpful with providing details about products that you're searching for and making them available. The app is simple to navigate and convenient to use.
The new update is to difficult to use search bar at the bottom of the screen gets is the way of viewing products only two of my icons work home an cart can't viewing my orders can't track my orders all in all my experience with the new update sucks so until you change it back or fix all the issues I'm shopping with ebay.
I can't say I've ever had a positive experience with this app. Abysmal loading times. The serch engine is NEVER accurate and the app itself is constantly crashing. There's always at least two loading errors whenever i want to use the app. I only use this app because its my only option.
"Haven't ordered from Amazon on quite some time, and decided to install the app for a purchase. The experience of searching for the item was fine, but when it came to put my info in for the purchase, it was horrendously slow and difficult. It took 14+ minutes to get my new card and address info in. I know it was at least 14 minutes because I put a small pizza in the oven for 14 minutes. I'd write more, but I'm limited to 500 characters, whis is about as limited as my patience with this app."
"User interface- The old interface was great! Why change it? The new one it's really bad for pretty much everything! Navigation, user experience, interface, logo, you name it!"
"Does not work on Samsung S10+. Have used until very recently on Sony and HTC phones with a reasonably good experience. On the Samsung, when you try to look at item details, it gives a blank screen with header and footer. Has lost Amazon over £500 in sales this weekend."
"Zero stars. Recent update has absolutely ruined my positive experience. Where is my drag and drop wish list? Where is endless scrolling we loved so much? It was great as it was, what was the point of removing such a great and unique features? l speak for myself but I think you may loose loads of customers due to making shopping with you difficult and unpleasant."
"Ok, this is really getting ridiculous... It takes way longer to add things to my lists than ever before. Yes, cleared cache, uninstalled/reinstalled, yadda, yadda, yadda. The shopping experience is worsening exponentially. Please fix it!"
"2 week deliveries -30 day returns (even when using Amazon Gift card),Clueless customer service, inaccurate pricing, software issues charging >electronic< insurance for sleeping bag!? The worst experience I've EVER had in my life is getting Amazon to fix a problem. I've actually had better service after I dropped my PRIME membership. Be ready to spend at least an hour on chat/phone,No matter what the issue."
"Just had the worse online shopping experience to date. Made an order which was met with an email saying suspicious account activity. Which is fine but there was no links in the email to fix the problem and when I went to the app I was on loop of putting in my password and solving a bot task probably did it over 20 times. Really disappointed for what is suppose to be a good reputable business. Now I've just wasted the last 45mins just trying to buy one thing, absolute joke"
Recent updates have caused images to disappear when scrolling through deals/lightning deals sections. As you scroll further they then appear for a few more rows before disappearing again. It really makes for a horrible experience whilst browsing.
"I've never used Amazon before ever in my life. And then Covid-19 hit so now all the stuff I had to get would be online, but now I use Amazon and it proves to be one of the most reliable and fast ways to get something you want! I just think that the user interface should be a bit easier to use on mobile. Totally reccomend 9/10"
I order some items using amazon gift card and it is only 25 Euros and for no reason at all amazon administration decided to lock my account and but my items on hold. I have reached the costumers service and let me tell you it is the worst experience I have ever had. They just keep talking with zero action or even explanation to why they do that to my account. I will never ever use this app again.
"Awful. No surprise. What is with these multi billion dollar corporations and their terrible apps? I wanna smash my phone every time I open this thing. It lags like crazy, freezes, randomly clicks on stuff while I'm scrolling. Also, cheap Chinese items DOMINATE the search results. Awful experience. Zero stars. Unacceptable."
"new user interface looks good. always loved the app, makes it a little too easy to spend your paycheck. I still like to support small local business but some things are a no brainer to just get on Amazon"
Being a prime member you aren't getting items delivered the same day Amazon should shut down their service. Amazon doesn't do whats been guaranteed that rather than other services. Awfull experience on most of the orders when it comes to refunds delay on it they just forgets to refund the money even though items are returned a 4vweks back
"Its hard to review something that doesn't work. The summation of my experience: Crashes. That is pretty much all I ever got from the app. It would briefly open, then show me a consolation picture of a cute dog, and crash with the ""Uh Oh! Looks like something went wrong...."" message. ""Home"" uh oh! ""Account"".. Uh Oh!.... ""Search""...Uh Oh!."
Amazon is becoming completely autocratic..no way to contact support.. irresponsible delivery agents who bar incoming calls and cancel return pickups. Delivery agents who order customer to search and fetch orders..no door step delivery.. selling faulty products at lower prices with no option of refund.. etc ...I am writing all this so that the customer support gets back to me... experience is very poor..sellers are fraudulent..taking advantage of the covid situation scamming people of their money
"Services take forever, i ordered an HDMI cable and got a power cable instead, so naturally I issued a refund, and after one month I got the money in my account but I wasn't refunded the full price, paid 41 got 29 back, if it was my mistake when buying the product yes I got no problem, but i shouldn't be charged for delivery and such if the mistake isn't from my side, weird and unprofessional experience."
I normally have a really good experience. They have great products. The cheaply made products are ok. But overpriced on somethings. I've been a prime member for years now. During quarantine I started reviewing products I ordered from them. They removed all my reviews. I emailed 3 times and called customer service 2. They gave BS answers and emailed me a list of rules. I ask which one they just send me the rules again. I dont understand how giving 5 star review broke the rules.
Update as of 2/21/23: this app remains at one stars because i have just found out from the Amazon fb page that when you had a new cc it locks your account and you have to verify it manually. I tried asking CS and they said nothing as changed from usually but it wasn't just one person but several with the same issue. Has anyone else experienced this? I'm worried when my cc comes up for updating if ill locked out and I really don't want to send documents to strangers to prove its my card!
Like everyone else during lockdown I have been ordering from amazon lots of different things including Christmas and birthday cards and gifts to sent to my grandchildren who I couldn't see. I have never once had a problem or had to return anything. It's my experience that things couldn't have been better
No permission to have voice typing but it could be worst anyway my good experience shopping usually is smooth. and my suggestion on the cart experience is (to tap the cart iconvthat's what works every time for me.
"Used to love but now I just like. Why did you change to having to click ""next page"" to see more products? It's really annoying and slows down my shopping experience. I liked it better when I could just scroll and scroll and scroll. I don't want to click next and it makes me not want to use the app. Continuous scrolling is superior."
I found at Amazon some of the most challenging things to find such as some unique books by certain authors and so forth on topics but they seem to come across very good I'm just now checking out some of these audiobooks pretty unique experience I'm enjoying it a lot but yeah been a good place for those hard to find things Amazon's been good
"I'm a prime member and use amazon regulary however the new ui just plainly suck. All I have is ads for amazon video and all I have on the home page are book and other stuff that I wont buy. Before, there was the daily deal page which was a way better experience. Now I just cannot find anything interesting by just looking at one place."
"the new update of amazon.sa is horrible , isn't costumer friendly at all , with only few options of products to show, with no filters to facilitate finding it , u can't costumize which colour , shape , size or price range u want . I had the worst experience ever when I ordered a toy for my kid , they promised to deliver it in a week , & after 11 days , they just cancelled it , I'm totally disappointed ."
"Merchandises sold in Amazon are more expensive than sold in other retailers plus you have to pay for another hefty annual subscription fee. Unfortunately even you have benefits with prime, most ppl don't use it. Also the credit card provided by Amazon is not good and I had bad experience with it."
I do a NOT pay $140 a year for you to STILL force STUPID ADS on me EVERY TIME I OPEN YOUR APP! I could not care less about your dumb Lord of the Rings show and the fact that you feel that it's necessary to force me to watch the SAME AD for it over and over every single time i open the app with NO option to opt out?!?! What am I giving you all this money for if it's not to have an ad-free experience?! This is the stupidest thing your marketing team has ever done. Your users do NOT want this.
"I HATE the new update on Android because it's incredibly backwards and annoying. Amazon is supposed to be an easy shopping experience, but this ""new"" update is regressive and confusing to your consumers. I've LOVE 99% of all the prior Amazon updates, such as ""the will it fit"" option on home items, ie desks, appliances, etc. Can I opt out of this update because it makes me want to shop less on the app - and isn't that counterproductive to ANY ""update""/company? I love Amazon but do better!"
"I was FORCED to update. I have been using an old release ON PURPOSE...as any newer version I have tried just SUCKED. But now they decided I HAD TO update for a ""better experience"". Well, that's bull. Big load of it. It's just getting worse with every ""better"" version. Not at all fit for my usage. I am majorly annoyed. And I would REALLY appreciate if I could decide MYSELF which version to use...and which version fits MY usage for a BETTER experience."
"My card had worked for over a year. They update their interface and now the same card that worked dozens of times is sending the wrong expiration date to my bank. Clueless overseas tech support says ""just get a new card"". The card works everywhere else and had previously worked on your site. I'm not getting a new one just because of your technical issues."
"Good to find most items, but a little annoying that the app brings you to the very top of the interface every time you get out linked and then go back, rather than bring you to where you were on the page before you click"
My recently bad experience is that in the tracking information it has mentioned that I received and signed for the parcel but it's simply not true! I didn't receive anything! Same thing happened with my friend yesterday. Also when the costumer service chat ends you can not see what that told you or see the chat anymore. Now I'm left clueless while my Christmas present is lost somewhere
"I've been bought in with Amazon for ever...but I will say this, every time I order groceries from Fresh to be delivered on a Sunday there is always some serious stress about when/if it'll be delivered. The foods do show up but there is a different experience in Sundays than any other day."
"This app is awful! No idea where messages go. No indication of a queue time when you try to request help. This is the worst interface for an app I have ever seen. Don't bother downloading. Devs, come on, do better."
Shopping at Amazon has been the most horrible ridiculous upsetting and stressful experience I've ever had shopping online. I've been trying to get one cat tree for over a month. I've had two refunds both which were credited to my Amazon account so therefore all I can do is order from Amazon again. horrible one cat tree they are incapable of delivering. my first and last time to shop Amazon
"Awful experience. I wanted my account deactivated which took getting mad at the customer service representative to do, he kept insisting I keep the account even though I politely asked to close it. Too many cheap products that aren't truthful in the description, drivers leaving packages out in the open for people to steal, drivers not coming at all, drivers calling me at 4a because they can't find the address.... Awful experience and I'll never ever use Amazon again."
"Ugh. Everytime I searched for a device Of course, they only sold the kindle tablets. I searched for iPads and iphones it only showed cases. This stuff can be very expensive as well. As far as my experience and opinion, I don't suggest/ recommend amazon."
Reduced to 1 star. Keeps getting slower with each update. Horribly slow since they changed the whole interface. Scrolling in my cart doesn't load hidden items anymore. Just annoying to use overall now.
Up until today I could add things to my cart. I've had great experience until today. Now I cannot add things to my cart. Until that is fixed I have to give it one star. I am on a Galaxy S9. I have been using Samsung products for over 10 years and have never had a problem until today. We are 11 September today. Perhaps it's the date.
Amazon is my primary buying source. Very rarely have I been disappointed and their service is outstanding. Great selection and inventory. Hard to beat the shopping experience and value.
"I can honestlly say Ive had nothing but positive experiences within the apps customer service. If I ever have an issue, they are always polite and quick to fix it, alot of times going above and beyond. Its a rare find these days. The people I speak with need a raise because customer service jobs are NOT easy, it takes a special breed to do those jobs, any service jobs for that matter. Much respect and appreciation."
"They make a damn intuitive app! Sure, they evaluate, influence & manipulate every click. They decide what we want/need and when we'll buy it. But at least they've made mind control a convenient & pleasant shopping experience."
"Was informed that I needed to update my app. I did so and now I have problems accessing. Keeps telling me I need to ""update app""...I will be uninstalling this. Totally worthless now. I once again updated on 10/21/18 and it still wants me to update every time I try to go to site. Extremely, extremely aggravated. Thanks for ruining my experience. Update: keeps asking to UPDATE APP. Absolutely ridiculous---ANOTHER UPDATE: keeps telling me to UPDATE(last available update was mid-Dec 2018 which i did)"
"I'm relatively new to placing orders on here. My first one was a great experience. The problem I am running into is that when I search for specific items, the app shows me everything else EXCEPT what I entered in the search column. I even try filters but it seems to do whatever it wants... like I said, I'm new to THIS shopping app but not others. So life it's me, please feel free to let me know what I'm doing wrong or give me helpful tips and advice. Thank you. AB."
"It's really a worst experience I have ever had on online shopping. To change my address I will have to cancel my order ""if applicable"" and reorder them back!! Also I have put my new address but I came as a billing address ?!! I really don't know what it does really mean and what is the difference.also the customer service agent ""feda'a are really useless"" no solutions to be given at all although she has kept me on hold for a 15 mins!!!!"
"Most of the time, I don't have an issue with Amazon. Today, I had the worst experience getting a package delivered. I ordered a mattress, supposed to be delivered on Tuesday. It arrived 4 days early with no notice. Told me the delivery couldn't be completed. I called UPS and a robot told me the package was delivered on the 13th. I made this order after the 13th. My partner called Amazon. Was on hold for 30 minutes, was told they couldn't find my account, put on hold for another 15, then dropped"
Now why oh why does Amazon want me to rate an app just solely tinted for shopping yes I have a wonderful experience shopping yes my stuff is delivered to my house on time but I have questions about if I'm paying for 2-day shipping why is it most of the items ordered recently I received three and four days later? So if you could address that particular situation this app is a 100% fine but just because I'm paying for one thing and I'm not getting it I rate this app of four. And it seems to be tha
"The user interface update is horrible. Why have what anyone who purchases from Amazon buried at the bottom i.e. cart, orders... or far off to the side where you have to scroll for it i.e. Whole foods 8n store code. I would expect a lot more from Amazon but these days when they miss nearly every ship date, sell used as new, etc... but Jeff has his rocket..."
"Amazon's entire customer service experience is poor, at best. Sure, they make ordering easy, but do you want to return something? Better hope Amazon doesn't decide to close your account for ""violating terms and conditions"". Want to speak to a real person that will help you? Yeah, that's not how Amazon works. Go to a brick and mortar or your local shop. Stop giving Bozo your money."
Integration w Whole Foods and email was a terrible user interface. Phone # to call on arrival on my email did not link...then when I called directly the customer service did NOT ever answer! FINALLY saw where the check in was on the Amazon app(not whole Foods app) and was able to check in. I AM a tech person and had a horrible frustration with the whole thing!
New interface sucks!!!!! Why did you mess with a great app? New interface is difficult to find things that were once in a nice one-stop shop area. Go back to the old interface.
Good deals and selection is pretty good. Some product quality is less than what was expected but overall good experience. Most clothing is not name brands I recognise or sizes are limited.
"1. Unable to change country/ region since the new update. 2. App is no longer designed to be mobile & customer friendly. Instead, now Amazon re-directs the customer to the product THEY want you to buy. Good luck with finding the product that YOU need. 3. Fake reviews and shady sellers. No action taken on Amazon's path to combat this. 4. Too many ads that completely ruin the customer experience on mobile. Conclusion: 1. Delete the app 2. Use the desktop version instead"
"My shopping experience with amazon is good. It's the rude customer service agents I have a problem with. I informed an agent that my order was delivered to the wrong address. He was very rude and insisted it was delivered to my right address even after I gave him the correct address. Because of his attitude, I will steer clear of amazon as best as I can."
"Amazon so far to me is #1,my purchases always comes on time,ive never lost anything that ive purchased from them ,unlike ebay I have lots of purchases that never came ,so That's y im giving Amazon's 5 stars, because of my experiences from their awesome customer service.,Thanks Amazon ,pls keep being the best !!! ......😀😊👈👍"
"I shop on Amazon quite a bit. Never really had a bad experience, just don't like how when an order qualifies for free shipping, Amazon automatically selects paid shipping and I have to go change it to free."
"Why can't I use the app in English. I live in Poland and it forces me to use polish. I prefer using the UI is English. Regional shopping and right to chose the language need to be different. The experience of using it in India, UK and Australia was great. Why am I being forced to use it in polish? Please make the language option different from the region the user is in. The user experience for the last year and a half has been horrible but like the language options just bugged me out. Fix it"
"I've never such an awful experience, I had a problem with the validation of my card and I've been trying to clear it for a week. The people I talk to in the costumer service don't even care to try and help solve the problem. The app is good but the people are not."
Terrible Amazon Household / Family experience. Amazon makes sharing with your children/household and payment methods so much more difficult than it needs to be. Your child gets a gift card but it doesn't cover the full amount of their order. Can they use it and have parent card cover the rest? NO. Tells you to buy more gift card. You do that and then it still charges the full amount to your credit card and leaves the full gift card balance alone. 1+ hours with tech support and nothing.
Before covid 19 the amazon app was amazing and so was the employees. Now everything is delayed they send almost 50% of my items to the wrong address thank god they send pictures and I know where it is. The whole company from my experience lately has went down. I have been a prime member for a very long time now and this is just unacceptable. I will say I still like amazon way more than ebay. But something has happened for the worse here lately. Just giving you an honest review on how I feel...
It works and they get a lot of my money. I would like to see them redesign the interface or at least allow custom shortcuts that are easily (one tap) accessed.
"App works very well, but have had a few bad products that I have wanted to leave warnings for potential buyers for, but have been blocked from leaving reviews. I waited to see if this was just a temporary issue, but apparently its permanent. Who wants to purchase items without being able to give any feedback about the experiences."
The scrolling needs to be corrected. The category and location panels at the top of the screen cause the scrolling to not match the screen input. This creates a jarring and distracted experience.
I only have one experience . I am new at on line shopping. I previously ordered some motorcycle parts and received them faster than they said. All the parts in perfect condition very good job with the packaging I would recommend this app to anyone that shops on line
Of course Amazon's app is pretty amazing algorithm wise.There is a lot of room for upgrade regarding your user interface. Bring some round edges and more gradient to your app. And at last make a version for Greece's market as well. Thanks for reading
"Very bad experience from Amazon.. being a prime customer the experience i received was so bad. If everything goes well then fine.. but if there is a problem then the real attitude of the sellers and even amazon customer representativea comes out. Items which are being paid are cancelled with out our consent and refund is promised in 2-3 days , but womt be receiving in after a week. Other options like flipkart is much better."
"When i was using souq app the user experience was very good but now since using amazon app really bad experience. When ever you want to search some mobile, only their cover and protectors are shown. Souq app was best app and i dont know why amazon change whole system, they need to change name only"
If you live outside the us this app isn't a good fit. I would expect a similar experience through the app as I would with the website. Im in Canada so naturally I should be connected through a .ca agent same as the websit. Everything gives me canadian prices and sellers etc. NOPE! How can a multi million dollar company mess this up so bad ffs.
"Poor interface. When you're browsing the app and you hit 'view as website/desktop' once, there is no way to make it go back to an app interface which makes scrolling and searching much, much harder."
There is hidden delivery charges which is not mentioned in product. As per the seller it is delivery free. But just before the final confirmation I am levied with huge delivery charges. Customer support is arrogant and narrow minded. Don't take the effort to understand and agent disconnected the chat when I was communicating also it took hours for them to check information and still it was not resolved. Pathetic experience. PLEASE BEWARE OF HIDDEN DELIVERY CHARGES BEFORE FINAL CONFIRMATION.
"Worst experience with Amazon gift card. Hopeless customer service. Seems like a scam is going on in Amazon. We got four gift cards on my son's birthday as a gift, loaded them into the account worth $135.00. Same day when we were about to use them, we don't see any balance in there. It's zero. No transaction history is shown and money just wiped out. Contacted customer care multiple times but all worthless. Please beware with this kind of scam. A real fraud is happening."
"Top notch customer service is unfortunately not matched by a top notch app experience. Really broken flow for payment - you don't even find out what you are going to be paying till almost the last step. REALLY broken customer service flow, you just keep going back and forth to figure out where you can contact customer service. Not sure what is broken here (operations?), but one day I am receiving my parcel, next day it's being returned to seller, a day later, I am receiving it again. No thanks!"
Recently something broke in the app. The product page flickers and the page becomes blank. Not able to select different options. Very frustrating experience. Please fix the issues.
"Freezing and needs to reopen all the time! I have a fold phone, it worked fine till today. It kept freezing and i had to reopen it. Its horrble experience that i am using the browser instead."
"Too much/many negative experiences!!. Spend too much time calling in to rectify. Prime was not honored in deliveries. Always excuses. I am rid of Amazon Prime who gypped me for two years in their online shopping promising me 5%. Every supervisor told me differently how to access the Prime discount for shopping Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh. They themselves aren""t versed in how to get it OR they lead you on like they did me and don't lose profits. Tired of not receiving items as promised at Prime"
"Terrible loading times, ugly colors, rude merchants not directly associated with Amazon make the app experience worse, stalker level notifications, evil subscription service that does everything to make you feel like you should continue using it when in reality there is no upside to prime because their shipping times are a joke just like the rest of the industry."
"Dreadfully, dreadfully slow. Website wrapper apps are usually pretty garbage, but this is in a tier of its own. You'd think the richest person on the planet could afford a better-designed app. I've had better user experiences with free apps designed by unpaid college students in their free time. I would literally rather order something over a phone call than use this app, and I'm Gen Z so that should tell you all you need to know."
I've had a great experience with this app over the years. It's pretty fast and accurate with searches of so many different products. I've been a Prime member for many years and this app just makes ordering and tracking orders quite simple.
"Love Amazon! I've only had good experiences so far. Anytime I've had a problem with a order they take care of it no problems! Not to mention, it's also super convenient to have anything I need delivered to my front door!"
"Latest update has ruined it. They've changed the interface for the worse, and the app its self is now mostly unresponsive even after uninstalling and reinstalling it. This really needs fixing and quick."
"I Love shopping with Amazon, for me it's a one stop shopping experience and there is nothing so far that they don't have in stock, amazingly fast shipping and customer service are really there to help, they go above and beyond to insure that you are satisfied!"
"Latest patch made it horribly slow to load, and new menu interface is annoying and was reposition completely unnecessarily. 2 22 2022 update still very slow to load menus even after new uodates. 9 2022 now they force video advert at startup of application... last straw, closing account."
"Lame UI update. Never realized moving search to the bottom of the screen would make the experience so irritating. Guess some ""smart"" people decided on this and now we are stuck with this ridiculousness. Huh."
"Don't like the new interface, hard to find what your looking for when browsing. Have to spend extra time just to figure out what button allows you to search through categories."
It was better when the navigation/menu items where at the top. This breaks modern user experience that you've had for years. Don't fix it if it isn't broken!!!!
The app runs very slowly on my Pixel 3 and gets hung up when try to progress through the shopping experience. The chat feature is useless. Did not answer my problem and no way to redirect it.
"I had an amazing experience for the longest time until my account was hacked and when I called the help line ended up getting more hackers who took more of my money. It has good product and I like the company but when even customer service isn't safe, I can't trust it. Run while you can."
Not optimized for font scaling. Increasing the font size of your phone causes the bottom of text to clip. Also dislike search functionalty. Limiting searches to 10 per page diminishes the shopping experience.
App is very unresponsive. Doesnt losd properly and lags on my note9. Ended up using the web interface through chrome to browse items instead. Please focus on the performace and usability of the app.
"My package was early enough to be sent out early but a big issue, its been late 2 times and don't know where it has been. Prime just makes it worst as it becomes late when ordering something. I had friends having this issue too as I never experienced til now. Amazon, please help me with this issue or link me to somewhere that I can read off of what I can do if my package is being late. Thank you."
"I ordered an Apollo Twin USB Heritage Edition audio interface for my music studio and Amazon shipped a wrapped ""Face Mask"" in a big box to me on the 31st Jan 2023. This item is worth over $1300 and I'm still yet to get a refund because Amazon has to ship the empty box + ""face mask"" back to them (US) before retuning my $1300+. I've been told I'll get a refund this week and I'm patiently waiting. 'I'll update this review if things change'. I regret using this app."
"3 years ago, hands down the best shopping experience. NOW it takes too long to get purchased items after they charge $120 annually. 7 to 30 delivery days on common items is not a ""PRIME"" worth experience. Seeing what else is out there."
"I love Amazon, shop on here all the time. If I find something at a store I want but don't like the price, I know Amazon will most likely have it cheaper. Delivery is fast as well. I have had nothing but great experiences each and every time I order from Amazon."
"The most disgusting customer service experience I've had in my life. Nothing but automated emails after they've blocked my account for changing my address to a different country because I moved. After 5 emails where they asked for all sorts of address verification and billing statements, they decided to simply reply that they have deleted my account and will not be sending or replying to any other emails from my address. Oh, and the money for what I have ordered is of course not back yet!"
"I literally cannot get the app to load anymore, it stopped working for me in the past few days. There have always been a host of other issues to contend with, but I was willing to put up with them. I guess the billions of dollars we shovel into the pockets of Bezos don't necessarily give us a better shopping experience, lmao. I feel like the least we could get is a working app."
"I often times can't use this app without a picture of a sad looking dog popping up with the phrase ""Uh oh, something went wrong on our end"" FORCING you to go to Amazon ""Home"". This is NOT the kind of shopping experience ANY retailer wants for their customers and its hard for me to understand why this isn't getting addressed given the millions of people who shop Amazon and Amazon's millions/billions of dollars net worth."
"Some frustrating behaviours. Android version has some quirky hiccups that I don't experience when I'm using the app on my iPhone. However, it's largely usable, so I will keep it for those times I can't access my iPhone."
"just downloaded it to see if they sorted when you search for something you scroll down so many then have to go to the next page which makes a horrible experience when searching for something, that's why I cancelled my prime membership and started using eBay much better experience"
"The app works great, but the newest update has moved the search bar to the bottom. This makes for a clunky UX experience. This was not the way to make the app better."
Horrible UPDATE the app takes forever to load and search for items. Horrible experience trying to find what I need. Buttons non responsive. White page after hitting a search selection.
Put the search bar back at the top. The bottom location makes a miserable experience to use. Usually i feel a 5 star level of an experience with the app. That change make a 2 generous
App hangs now after update... Interface changed with previous update that made it harder to use. Let's not get started on how the two day delivery seems to constantly turn into 3 or 4 day delivery or longer.
I am very disapointed in my recent shopping experience. I received the wrong item and when I reported it nothing was done about it. Amazon really dropped the ball. Well it is 4:00 on Christmas eve and I checked the mail again and there was the package. What a relief. Thanks Amazon!
Great app & service! Amazon makes shopping easy with their user-friendly interface and you can always count on their efficient service. Things always arrive on time and well packaged.
"Great shopping experience. Integrated Alexa is utterly untrustworthy. The Alexa feature on a Kindle Fire (bought and returned) consumed data even when denied all permissions. There is no reason to believe other installations / versions of Alexa are any more trustworthy. Shop Amazon on your browser, just don't trust the app."
I have never had great experiences with any online shopping. when I came across amazon I always had my packages on time and was able to track if needed. I always will choose amazon as my #1 go to for online shopping!!!
"What I have experienced in making orders from this app is that a lot of the products are very deceptive, they promote a lot of junk from China, they need to be more transparent about where the products are from. Sell more American made items..."
Can't really fault Amazon. my experience has been pretty good. Everything from Audiobooks through to buying white goods on the app. The customer service is much better and faster now than it has ever been.
great experience shopping here. it's quick easy to just about anything. having a prime membership only makes a already great experience even better. easy returns easy order cancelations but rarely necessary.
"I've been using this app for long. Very good shopping experience, my wish list, the drug and drop function and everything, indeed a very efficient app, until you guys did, I don't know what! But you are not improving it"
Frustrated. This app rarely works for more than 5 minutes. Constantly saying something went wrong. Easier to use the Wed interface. If you have to have it then gooluck to you.
"Was fine, now I cannot find my lists, change any settings, nor navigate intelligently. How dare Amazon kick themselves in the teeth by sabotaging their loyal patrons experience. Have they forgotten the first rules of business .. keep the customers happy and make a profit. Forcably altering the shopping app and imposing a global unnessary change to limit the shoppers experience is not working in their favor and is a raw rejection. This has become a sorry app for picture driven kindengardeners."
"Amazon's graphic user interface has become laden with useless garbage. Unless one know the exact product number for what one wants, Amazon is a lousy way to try to find a product."
"The more updates the less user friendly it becomes. There was nothing wrong with the previous interface. Now I have select this, scroll down here, click this. Keep it simple to navigate for price customer reviews and so on."
"I hate it when the app said ""Delivered"" when I haven't even received the package. It gets me anxious as to where is my package. And it's really hard to contact seller. Amazon keeps getting me to help support but no ""human"" costumer service. Bad user interface."
"I don't have words to describe my experience with Amazon UAE.If I was able to rate it with 0 stars I was doing it. When you have a big order expect a lot of problems like : your items are just dropped at the door on 40° even you didn't request that either you are home or not,they lost the packages in UAE for 1 week(wrong courier) and they send back your items after you waited almost 1 month ,they inform you that your order will be delivered in that day but they don't.So many...i m done!"
"for so long i had a good experience with Amazon, but recently i had an issue and the three instructors couldn't solve it for me, also today the delivery guy left my order on the door without even calling me, even tho i informed the customer service that i should receive a call because it's not convenient to leave the order at the door. the customer service should be willing to really help in a professional way"
"Great Shopping Application in general. Great addition to your Amazon suite of services. Very useful, simple and intuitive. The interface is very well developed. Many features that make shopping a accessible and enjoyable experience."
"My experience with Amazon in general and the app have always been easy and simple. Never had any technical issues and if I wanted to return items for a particular reason, it was always done without a problem by following the guidelines from Amazon."
In my own personal experience buying most dear items from Amazon when it comes to quality and excellent products remained unmatched and unchallenged. Durability and satisfaction on products with longer timeline of use than expected outweighs any pricing you can only wish still possible to be reduced than what was already done.
"The best shopping experience in my life. The customer support and the team of this amazing platform is purely legendary for its kindness and understanding. These guys will always solve their users problems no matter what. The best proof of being a human is right here in this platform. I recommend using it from the bottom of my heart. Amazon was, is and will always be one of the best shopping experience. Thank you guys !"
"I love my Amazon, I didn't think I would ever love shopping until I got my prime Amazon prime is the best shopping experience and I've never ever been disappointed with anything I've ever ordered my only problem now is I can't stop ordering stuff I think you guys should give points to people when they order stuff so they can collect them and get free stuff or gift cards. I also love my prime TV there's not one movie I can't find I would never have cable, I just get internet & I Love it 💕"
"Terrible experience, After making multiple orders and paying for them online, they have closed my account without providing any details And they didn't deliver the orders, and also not returning the money back, aka 100% scammers. Ensure to not pay online and to check your order when you receive it, to avoid getting scammed by them. Amazon Egypt = some thieves."
"Absolutely horrible experience. I paid for 1 day shipping at $10.00. Your driver marked my package as delivered and said it was in the mail room. It was not. When I called, they said that it was an error and it was not delivered and that all they would do was return my shipping fees. Now, a day later and I have no idea where my package is or when I'll get it. I called again 24 hours later, and they still couldn't give me an answer besides wait until tomorrow. Absolutely absurd!"
"I've been an Amazing customer since the mid 1990s back when they mostly only sold books. Amazon continues to offer ""extreme excellence"" in customer service while catering to customer preferences, needs and wants. Anazon goes above & beyond to give customers awesome value, experience & service!!! Thank You Amazon Team & Jeff Bezos for continuing to be my #1 online company."
"Worst experience I've ever had! I bought a unit, and someone at Amazon DIDN'T DO THEIR JOB! I received the unit in non working order! They refuse to do anything about it! Mind you, they took my money within an hour of placing the order! But I can't get refunded until they have product in hand, and 3-5 business days AFTER THAT? Customer service is very rude! As soon as I get my refund? I'm cancelling my subscription, and WILL NEVER USE THEM AGAIN!"
Search bar keeps getting moved to the bottom. This makes it a very unpleasant experience. The experience is so bad that I have been shopping on Walmart and Ebay apps instead.
"I think due to my experience with Amazon is that I will never try to do business with ever again. I'll explain WHY??? I placed an order in the middle of Dec 2020. I watched the price as well as the taxes be take from my debit card. With that I was told that my purchase would be delivered with in the next 7 to 10 bussiness days. So I patiently waited, then the a lotted time had passed by about 5 days. I call to check on order and they have no record of my purchase. So they screwed me out of my $"
"Everything is good about the Amazon app: shopping experience, delivery, return policies. On a side note, it seems like someone in the marketing department called a meeting and said ""I am thinking of changing the app Icon. People are too familiar with the clean whit and blue shopping cart theme. I know, lets make it ugly. How can we do that?"" And the came up with an ugly blob with a smile to look kind of like a side of a cardboard box. A vote was taken and it was decided. Hense the new ugly a"
Everything seems to be goid.. this is for the customer service.. I had issue of returning an item to a 3rd party seller.. agents not only are unable to help but one agent just hung up on me when asked for the supervisor... Amazon also blocked me from writing reviews for no reason... horrible horrible experience this time.. DONOT buy anything if the seller is a 3rd party....
"This is an excellent app to access a great service (and when you pay it's even better service because they take care of the people that are helping them). It seems that this company cares about the 'little people' and make sure that they are taken care of even if they can't take care of themself let alone anyone else. Tʜɪs ᴀᴘᴘ ɪs ᴀs ᴄᴜsᴛᴏᴍɪᴢᴀʙʟᴇ ᴀs ᴛʜᴇ ᴡᴇʙ sɪᴛᴇ! Basically meaning that, if you spend enough time customizing, this app is for EVERYBODY and anybody can have a good experience. TY"
"Bug Summary: Grocery Search is broken, results shown only include Amazon, not Fresh or Whole Foods results. Hardware/Software: I have a Samsung Fold 3 running the latest app version and latest Android on Verizon. Steps to replicate: 1. Go to the home. 2. Click on Groceries. 3. Click on ""Shop Now"" on Fresh or Whole Foods. 4. Type anything in the search bar, e.g., ""organic bananas"". 5. Even if I click on ""organic bananas in Amazon Fresh"" suggestion, the search results are all Amazon and no Fresh or Whole Foods items. Expected behavior: search results limited to the grocery experience I am in, e.g., Fresh or Whole Foods."
Search became tiresome with the latest update. Amazon is my favorite e-commerce website. But the latest update screwing my experience. It's so annoying to keep pressing NEXT to see more products in the same criteria and going back is even worse. Need to press BACK many times to be able to see last visited category. Please correct this soon.
I pay for prime and yet it constantly tried to deselect same day delivery to the point where I had to cancel an order because it selected its own delivery speed. Horrible user interface. The app has a lot of bizarre and confusing features.
What a god awful experience using this app and trying to pickup from a drop box. WOW! I honestly think this killed Amazon for me. Such a painful and long process. Yeah I'm done ready for whatever Amazon 2.0 is because this is horrible. There is not enough space here to express how long and painful using this app. Honestly could have gotten everything done I needed to EASIER is I wrote Letters to the sellers. Just wow. Who ever is in charge of this app and it's development needs to fired.
"Worst experience in my life. Seriously, the absolute worst customer service I've ever dealt with and I'm in Cybersecurity myself so I've dealt with really bad services before. If I could upload the screenshots of the customer service I would! Customer service representative straight lied to my face on multiple occasions about multiple things for 1 problem(moving my delivery date from Saturday to Wednesday). $10 maximum for any mess ups(TOTAL) 5 day difference only $10 credited for $125 spent."
"I had such a horrible experience using this service and this app I don't ever buy anything from amazon, ever."
"I have never once regretted installing the Amazon Shopping App. My experience shopping on there had been positive. I found great prices and returning weren't difficult to the point I'd rather avoid it, they took good care. Especially if not having to pay for return fee. It's been great to me so far."
Amazon shopping is the retail therapy for me. I think Amazon has to be the #1 in the nation for excellent service and even more excellent customer service. I can confidentially tell you that anyone who hasn't shopped online should start with Amazon. Amazon is definitely the most worry free place to order anything from. They have absolutely everything you can think of and they back everything they sell with a 30 day return policy. From my experience returns are 100% hassle free and friendly!!
"Terrible experience from start to finish. I wanted Amazon to be my store/source for getting most of my purchases. Due to lack of information on their website, off-shore style customer ""service"" call centre and the inability to even apologize for their own problems- i gladly ended my trial membership with Amazon. What they refuse to tell you on their website's payment options is the fact that Amazon doesn't accept their own gift cards for huge amounts of items they sell. They choose not to it."
"Very poor and hard to use user interface, Everything is so cramped up and messy that you can't tell the difference between a button and another, and some buttons and settings are impossible to find even with the help of a video."
Now there is an annoying floaty button for Alexa on this app. Why does Amazon keep nagging and trying to get people to use Alexa? Probably to steal personal data or something. Either way some of us dont like talking to our phones and prefer to just tap. So stop trying to get people to use it. If people want to use it fine. But why the obnoxious button that is not in line with the rest of the interface?
I always enjoy my shopping experience on the Amazon app. it is easy to navigate and has clear concise photos and descriptions of products. They also offer a hige variety of products and wonderful costumer service as well.
"Thanks to the latest update, the app now takes almost a full minute to launch. Yet another example of developers trying to justify their salaries with overly complicated ""updates"" that just muck things up by layering in options and interfaces no one asked for. Very frustrating."
Very bad experience at first attempt. I had orderd and payed for a material and the amout was creditted from my account. again they said they did not het the payment. so I cancellwd the payment and asked them to refund my money. they said they will do it within 3_4 working days. and now it is more than 3 weeks and I did 't get the money back. Really cheating
i brought an iteam which was faulty through a third party seller but i had to pay and arrange return postage even after sending pictures. everytime I called customer service they would insist the return was sorted and on 2 occasions sent an email to say i cancelled return which i never. After a month of still not sorted.   The entire experience which is on-going has ensured this is the first and only time I shall be trying to purchase anything via Amazon. From now on it’s eBay all the way.
It is by far the worst app experience I had. No videos or photos from reviews can be seen without slowing downs. Nothing about this is designed and optimized well. For IOS it works fine but my phone with sd 855 works with 5-10 fps.
"I hate how icons for items are now videos... I'm scrolling, trying to look for a product I want, and I can't even tell what products look like because it's a teeny tiny video of people moving around. The whole experience is distracting and unpleasant."
"Amazon changed the layout of the app, now I cannot find where I can log out, change country or any other setting. The app is trying my patience every time I want to use it. It's interface sucks and difficult to navigate. Is Amazon try to experiment on torturing customers? Because using the app feels like torture."
"The app is not intuitive & in need of a user experience team's review, that said, it's not as bad as the website. I wasn't able to add my husband to my prime account & after spending ages working out how to contact Amazon I was simply told it is not available in Australia!? OK selection of products but when you search you have to scroll down past all the sponsored stuff to get your results. Also you need to watch the delivery, there is a manual option to select if it ships from Aus but it resets"
Nearly always a flawless experience when using Amazon products and services. I've always been happy with my deliveries and to the best of my knowledge I have thankfully never had reason to complain. Good app and I love the new icon.
"I have never been disappointed with my orders ( and I order a lot for my business) from Amazon. In the unfortunate event of a damaged item or receipt of a incorrect item, return and/or replacement is so easy. Thank you for making my shopping experiences so pleasant."
"Rubbish new interface with last update. Menu buttons are now at bottom of screen clashing with android home button and controls. If you manage to select correct menu without accidently exiting the app, the view is oversized, messy and cumbersome."
The app sux much like Amazon my whole Amazon experience. I was toyed with all week with the arrival dates and times constantly changing and me having to rearrange my schedule. Today I waited all day only to get a message at the last minute that my order has been pushed to the next day. I will never order ish from Amazon ever again!!!!
"The app is not adapted to tablet, like a lot of other online shopping apps, it does have another separated app for tablet though. It's such a hasle, and visually it is not appealing. The functionalities are there so it gets the job done, but you need to think about the customer's experience more."
"I'm not crazy about the new interface. The previous one was much easier to use 😣 Don't bother calling Amazon, because nobody there uses the app. They use a computer. Having said that, I love Amazon. Please give us back the previous one!"
"Awful Update. Awful User Experience Now! I don't know what you've done, but the app is now unusable!? If I click on an image, I can't go back? The new multiple filters along the top are awful. I could go on, but I can't be bothered. Terrible update."
"Purchased a few items from Amazon and have had a very positive experience. Recieved 14 days free prime membership which was useful for the the little things that I purchased, everything was shipped quickly and recieved sooner than expected. The app works fine for me, not a problem."
"I give this horrible review due to a trick Amazon played with an online app of theirs that let's you win a samsung s10 but then tells you to go to the app and download just for it to state that it's not available in your country.... F-U-2. Not funny. Out of all the horrible experiences with Amazon and the merchandise not working, banged up during delivery, missing accessories, not honoring replacement merchandise, not returning merchandise to the correct address never got it back, sending the w"
"Amazon is an exceptional experience. I love it, especially the access to buying lower priced items (maybe the box had a dent). So what? The item is still perfect."
"Amazon doesn't want to follow your delivery instructions. I really don't know what to do because I keep asking for my packages to be hidden but they leave them out in the open. Then when the app asked me how my experience was, it won't allow me to say anything about the delivery . I'm almost ready to just stop using Amazon all together. It's not like I use it very often anyways."
"Alexa button can't be removed (luckily it's not there (yet) when using the Canadian store, but is there in the US store. Also pops up little notifications to suggest using Alexa while I'm scrolling through, _right_where_I_scroll_from_. Amazingly annoying, horrible experience. I can see myself using the app, and therefore shopping, less if this becomes unavoidable in the Canadian store too. Which is ultimately a good thing I guess. Side note: 500 characters is not enough to write a detailed revie"
"The Amazon Shopping app is easy to use, convenient, and simple. Good interface and I've never really had any problems using it. As far as shopping apps are concerned, there isn't much for me to criticize. Good job, Amazon app devs. 5/5."
"I Always have a good experience with Amazon and their app. I've since subscribed to Amazon Prime.. the bonuses are endless!! If you use Amazon more than 7/8+ items a year, it's worth having just to cover delivery costs.. never mind all the added extras that comes with prime!!! 👍"
The best online shopping app hands down. The interface is easy to use/navigate. The products pop up w/ no issues no matter if you're on Wifi or a mobile network. The Amazon app is my favorite shopping app hands down.
All but one experience excellent. The one bad experience involved an independent shipper who couldn't locate my order for at least three weeks. The item was huge and the shipper was very uncooperative despite my numerous chats via Amazon.
Main Screen. None of the pics work when you click on them. Like none of them. What did you do?! Terrible update and interface. I can't click on a single product in my main Screen anymore. Kinda hard to find the item now
"I ordered something, got 1 day shipping and paid for it. They then sent me an email saying it would be delayed and that I wouldn't be paying for shipping. Then I received another email saying it's been shipped and that I will be receive it today. After another hour they sent another email saying I will not be receiving my package until like 2 or 3 days. I looked in my bank account and I was charged for the shipping. I have amazon prime. This is a horrible experience."
"Amazing company. Basically I don't like these kind of monopoly companies. However this one is handling customer very fairly. One of the best customer experience in India. I had issue with fabber dishwasher, with in a month. Fabber customer service simply ignored my issue and said this is how the product is designed and ignored to fix them. I reached out to Amazon. Though the return policy is 14 days, Amazon helped me to get complete refund even after the date is over."
They actually had the Size that I needed which was a relief for the pain that I experience every day.
"My experience isn't good I really don't like how I was treated with buying stuff. It's like I'm getting punished for buying stuff and it's ""suspicious"" and y'all locked me out of my account for buying stuff. customer service wasn't no help and I found the thing I wanted on another website. And I still got my money because they cancelled the order over all not a great first impression on a new account and I don't like the rules on the app one little move and your toast and I think that's to harsh"
"Account put on hold for some unknown reason while placing an order for less than $50. Never had to experience this while shopping Amazon before, and this has occurred with a relative of mines recently as well. Cannot make purchases. There are better alternatives to Amazon, so Amazon account users, be careful. Keep your information safe and monitor ALL transactions if you shop with Amazon."
"Had a bad experience with what seems to be Amazon's new approach to returns. Everything now goes through a chat bot, which told me incorrect information and sent me to dead links and was generally not very helpful when a package marked as delivered never arrived. When I asked the chat bot about this, it told me to wait some more days to see if it turned up. The parcels still don't come. Now I have to wait 5-7 business days to get a refund to reorder my stuff, all of which is currently available."
"Honestly the shopping experience is fine but I left a one star because everytime I use a gift card on Amazon it cancels my order and temporary locks my accounts. They said to put in the information, which I did and send a document. I didnt know what they meant so I just sent them a picture of the gift card. Now I'm permanently locked out of my account. This happened on 3 separate times, 2 with Amazon gift card and 1 visa gift card. Please let me just buy off of your site!"
Laura at your Concord NH location runs a very nice customer service oriented group of people. All the girls there know me by name and that is very important in excellent customer service. Being a former big box retail manager I know and appreciate employees that remember who I am and go out of their way to do everything possible to make transactions there an enjoyable experience. And this crew is the best! I've been going to this bank since it was Concord Savings Bank. Thank You! Kevin Robie
"I have had a great experience with them . They have followed my delivery instructions. I've only had to return one order & great options they have on how wish you refund to be. Give it a shot, that's all you can do . :) HAPPY SHOPPING."
"A great service, but seller reviews would be a good addition. Sellers should have a reputation like on eBay. On both platforms (eBay and Amazon) anyone can sell anything. But choosing who you buy from should go beyond what price they are selling an item at. I realize there are product reviews however they may not include the buyer's experience. Though If I was able to simply click on a sellers profile and see that they have a good track record, I'd feel a fair bit better about buying on Amazon"
"my experience with Amazon shopping has always been a negative one. Their deliveries are never on time, their customer service I'll be kind with words does not reinsure anything, they don't stand by their guarantees, they don't stand by their shipments, it is absolutely the worst company I've ever worked with in my life and I actually pay for it monthly. As of today I'm canceling my membership because my dissatisfaction has been sold multiple I no longer can take it. They literally ruined xmas"
"So far, I have been pleased with my Amazon experience. I had ordered a bathing suit and put it aside until I went on vacation. On vacation, I tried to put it on and couldn't get it much past my knees.It is a size XR. I needed and ordered a 2X. I have no idea how to return for either a credit or exchange. Help with this problem is needed. Thank you for your help."
"I used to use this app before and it was good. I ordered a ring light on January. When I ordered it said delivery in 2 days. Later it said next month. February 6 was the date, they said its delayed, after one week they said my package is lost. I didn't get a refund and my product. My money is lost. Worst experience ever"
Fairly easy to use but there's some options on Web not available in mobile . There is however some weird glitching when I view the orders page. E.g the text will continously jump and it gets worse as a I scroll and stop. Overall experience is good
Not a smooth experience.. Great shopping site but for a long while on the app now there is a very annoying glitch. When you thumb up to scroll items it mostly doesn't scroll and sometimes goes downwards. Like walking in deep mud almost every 3rd or 4th scroll. Not my phone settings btw.... Any one else have this problem ?
"I can barely even shop on the Amazon app now with my upgraded new LG k51 phone. It's like 3 quarters bigger than my other phone and so anyways, the app interface when I click it, shows the products and desktop* version of Amazon all zoomed in even though I'm on the app until I can't barely see anything.Uninstalled and reinstalled the app and restarted my phone and still same. I hope it gets fixed soon since it's really putting a damper on my shopping and I'm sure a whole bunch of people like me"
"Worst experience ever. For being the first time using the platform, I had a terrible (horrible) time trying to purchase a computer, because you decided to suspend my account, due to unusual activity, when ironically that was the very first time I purchase something through your website. Had to prove through a billing statement that the payment method I was trying to use was indeed mine. I proceeded to cancel all my orders. Maybe I'll try your platform to purchase small items."
"Sluggish performance. Not sure why, but even the website on my Android is sluggish. Many times I have the stop or wait dialog box pop up because the app is hanging. This is NOT an enjoyable shopping experience."
"I had had an alright experience with amazon up until today. I looked in my bank account to find that I had been charged for amazon prime. I was shocked, as amazon had offered me a free trial of amazon prime yesterday, but they had neglected to inform me that the trial would end today. Edit: I got a refund. the customer service was great, but I wish I didn't have this issue in the first place."
"Terrible shopping experience, I'd save time and money by visiting Walmart, or shopping from Ali express since most items on Amazon take a month to get delivered with no option to filter them out, also price sorting is useless even price range filter is absent, confusion at every corner made to make you spend more, even the shipping for prime members is handled by default by the horrible canada post, payment issues, terrible design..."
"They keep changing the interface, always new ways to find your orders. But it's in a good direction. Just be careful with the biased rating's. Free returns are always nice."
"Who doesn't have this app for shopping; is missing alot. Just like my husband who doesn't like using his phone for anything online but prefer his computer 🙃 🙄 🙂 😅 I love love Amazon app and I have had the best experience 💓 💗 💕 💖 ❤ ☺ You get notifications when you order is delivered, you can chat to rectify your problems with the incredible customer service, there is more when you have it."
"Perfect, make me search for my account or lists! Do your developers actually buy anything from Amazon? Omg, I finally clicked on the bottom right in a blank space and the menu button appeared. Most companies engage in uat, or even beta testing to avoid this experience for their users. Get it together Amazon."
"I am an Amazon lover! I buy all my products almost exclusively from Amazon. I am very picky with my clothing and I usually go to the stores and shop for them, but now I've tried their clothes. If I don't like something I just send it back, no questions asked. Although, I've had a great experience with clothing on the website. Try it!!! You'll be impressed with products and service. Then you'll be a Amazon lover too!!"
"Amazon Prime is the Best way to Shop! I used to be So afraid to Shop ONLINE😳. Worrying if I would get the right item or just get ripped off in some way or another..But I buy the pre-paid Amazon card and load it on my phone within seconds and I'm ready to Shop!! I have nothing but good things to say because there is ""literally"" nothing negative about my experience!! I Love it!😁"
Best shopping experience ever! I use this at least 3 to 4 times a week if not more! Even have groceries delivered from Fresh without the upcharge that other sites have. Absolutely love it and recommend it to anyone that looks for convenience!
"When you scroll the images disappear on lightning deals etc. Tried the online chat, spoke to about 5 different reps about it, basically got no where. Not a very good shopping experience as you have to click on every description to see what the product is!"
"Not available in English for customers living in the Netherlands!? Unable to pay with iDeal in app. Unable to redeem voucher in app Even the app icon is, now was, the most boring thing on my phone. I removed the app. Browser experience is just so much better."
"I'm done and going to Target. The sponsored listings were always annoying since we pay for Prime but now they're every fourth listing and the rest is off-brand garbage. For how much Prime costs, we should be getting an ad-free experience!"
"Seems like they did a new update. Old app used to load super fast and was in a list format when you search for items. Now the app is deathly slow and my searches get grouped by company.. then similar items.. then other recommendations. Do not like new interface for search, do not like new update, if you want something to update. Update your review system. I left a GREAT review and it got denied for posting Change. It. Back. Not a happy Amazon customer. So hard to use the app! App is slow now."
"Good UI and search. One complaint is the recent addition of the Alexa button on the top right next to the search icon. I keep accidentally hitting it because it looks so much like the search magnifying glass icon. ( I do not wish to use voice search) -- Sep 2020: please make the whole foods shopping experience better. Tough to search for items specific to whole goods. Keeps mixing in Amazon Fresh and regular Prime items. Some items are visible in the ""aisles"" mode but not when you search."
"Installed because the website said it allowed contact with customer service. It doesn't, just like the website does not - every mislabelled option and endless loop of automated misunderstanding is just repeated in text form. Interface is slightly worse than the website, which is saying something"
"Love Amazon hate the new updates. No longer user friendly. can't find open orders that have long ship times. To many extra presses to get to orders. And everything is all over the place. Whom ever thought these interface updates were a good idea should be fired, from a Canon, into a brick wall."
"Good quality products, hassle free shopping. Great customer service. Shipping is always on schedule and a lot of times my deliveries come early. Always a great shopping experience. I love the new products that are introduced everyday."
"It's my go-to site to double check pricing, I usually end up buying on Amazon....😂. Shipping is fast and reliable. Customer service reps friendly and helpful, had to return a product that malfunctioned within the 30 day purchase. Got a new replacement next day of notifying the CSR. A very painless process! A+++ online shopping experience"
"I don't know if it's just a version in my country or something, but I had the most impossible experience, when searching for the things I've wanted, no option to see all departments / all catgeroies in a department, how am I suppose to filter? Very disappointed."
"I love doing business with Amazon everything is always perfect exactly what I ordered and shipping is amazing fastest ever, prices are unbeatable, anything you can think of I'm pretty sure you'll find it in Amazon, they're the best online shopping experience I'd recommend."
"I've been a member just a short time, since last October. I order on a very regular basis. If you live in the Champaign Illinois delivery area the drivers either can't read it won't read the delivery instructions, and then lie about it. 4 times they have said they handed the package directly to me, but I was at work! Then if you call, the logistics department will say they are going to take care of it, but they don't either. Not a very good experience with Amazon."
"I also hate the new UI. I can't access my orders quickly like before. Amazon banned me from leaving reviews.I have always kept it professional. It just looks better to keep it professional, but some of the merchandise sold on Amazon are counterfeit or are poor quality. Not to mention the price gouging on many essentials. I had to be honest with my experience with the products I buy. I am still trying to overturn their decision. Just be warned. They will banned you for honest leaving reviews."
"eBay new app interface is a big step up, I love it. Amazon new app interface is a big letdown; they switch everything around making it difficult and confusing to navigate."
"The worse experience ever, I ordered a mobile and I paid extra amount to get it fast by next day, later I kept on following up for three days and didn't arrive at all, the customer service they are all lying about the order. The surprise is after 4 days of follow up they canceled my order. Not recommended at all"
I am a prime member. This is the only shopping platform that provides the best customer service in the world. I have had lot of previous bad experience with places like asos bohooman wish etc. No wonder why amazon is the richest company in the world currently.
"I don't know if you noticed that, but since 3 days the app keep crashing just when i start it: it shows the home interface then restart again and again and again.....i deleted it twice, updated it, but still.... i can't use it.."
"Best shopping experience. Costumer service, variaty of options. The level of customer satisfaction is above & beyond. If you get prime membership your life will become easier & full of entertainment. I cannot imagine life without it. I hope i never do."
"Loathe the new interface. The previous UI was near perfect. I spend too much time now looking where things are. Complete mess ! As others have said ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"""
I think it is an awsome app however there should be an offline mode when people are out and about and want to buy something and dont want to forget it in the next couple of days but over all best shopping app in my experience.
"Worst flow ever! App doesn't support currency for Denmark, can't find out where to drop off a package, from geo location and forgets anything you were doing almost constantly... Generally a poor experience browsing."
"This is the sixth time that your driver delivered to the wrong address. I always leave clear instructions on the app and they drove right pass me and left my package at an unoccupied building where it could have been stolen. It's like the drivers don't bother to read directions nor follow them. The Amazon app experience itself is fine, but the incompetent drivers ruin the experience of being a prime member in the first place. Quit hiring drivers who lie when and where they deliver their packages"
"Terribly frustrating experience, for months with this app. Just tried again after an update, but no. Still can't shop with app, still can't log into my account with the app. Any other uses for the ting, before I send it to uninstall heaven?"
This app lags so freakin badly. Takes forever to move or delete stuff on my lists. I don't experience this problem on the website when using my laptop. Until amazon truly fixes this app I can't use it anymore. It pisses me off too badly.
"The latest update is a pain in the butt, and totally unusable... I switch markets constantly and this interface is making it impossible for me to do it. Also that annoying emerging tab is disgusting and intrusive AF. GO BACK TO A NORMAL APP!"
"This app used to work properly, not so much anymore. Both the app and website are clunky & full of unnecessary nonsense making the user experience poor. All that junk also causes the interface to be glitchy and extremely slow"
"Worst shopping experience ever,my order was canceled after a week without any prior notice then after complaining to the customer service, I made another order and they told me that they will review my complain and feedback me and nothing happened, for the second order, I didn't receive this item which I ordered any I received another item instead and couldn't reach customer service again"
Would be great if they had other ways other than a phone number to verify for log in. I changed my number and now can't even get into my account because I'm unable to receive notification to get logged in. It's super disappointing considering I have great shopping experience with them and am disheartened that I'm gonna have to make a new account just because my phone number is no longer valid. 😐
"Lacking basic functionality like filtering for custom prize range. Interface for filtering and sorting confusing and frankly ugly. With so many different and very similar products, this functionality and its ux should be at the heart of the app."
Very easy to use app. Intuitive and self explanatory. Been Amazon shopper for a while. They improved the app over the years and continue to do so. The online shopping experience is on another level.
Horrible experience there was a discount on the cooler master mm711 and when I bought it it said that the order got cancelled and to buy it u have to pay more?????? Thus was so disrespectful 😒 and the app is so bad especially the filter the only good thing is that it has alot of thing rather than that it was so bad I would never EVER going to buy anything fix ur app
"Never disappointed with product quality or delivery My order concerns are addressed with professionalism. I haven't been disappointed with Customer Service, not even once. This is an amazing feat for any business in retail. They immediately address inquiries. The Customer Service's result is always unexpected, for me, because I have never experienced the old adage ""The Customer is Always Right"" until now. Customer Service Techs are always polite, professional and they listen. Thank You so much!"
"It's my primary interface with Amazon, but it requires me to log in via Web browser to manage subscriptions. It happily lets you subscribe though, so it's clearly inconvenient by design."
"This company makes 1.2 billion dollars a day. You can easily Google that. However, they outsource their customer service to the Philippines, just to save a little bit of money. Customer service representatives in the Philippines regularly lie to customers from my recent experience. Also, there policies change by the day apparently. As one of the largest, most well-known companies in the world, you would rather give absolutely horrendous customer service as opposed to spending a little more."
"Will not only fail regularly, they will blame you for it and make you jump through hoops to get your money back for products they never delivered. Don't buy anything on here you aren't willing to go without. I saved a good bit of money on this app before they clawed all of it back and more by being intentionally obtuse with their customer service department. This is from someone with 20 years of customer service experience. I'm easy to deal with until you cross the line into stealing my money."
First experience I have ever had with a nap. Why the hell I loaded this damn thing I don't know. I was wanting to purchase some stuff but you can't purchase nothing. Something always happens on your end and it crashes. Don't waste your time loading this app. Amazon sucks
"I love Amazon as far as my shopping experience but this review is for the boomerang subscription. I paid $4.99 to watch boomerang mostly bc of looney tunes bc they are my fave cartoons but it's sad to say all of the bugs bunny, duck dodgers, and looney toons shows on here are newer and not the original cartoons I was very upset to find that there's no way to watch the classic looney tunes therefore this was a rip off and do not recommend. The new shows are garbage compared to what it used to be."
"What happened? Amazon now sucks. I cannot even think of a better word to describe my experience this past year. It seems they cannot handle customer service at any level. Charging for things they shouldn't be charging for , I'm all about diversity but MY FIRST LANGUAGE IS ENGLISH is it possibly to cater to that? (if I can't understand you, it's not personal) I've waited for call backs that never came, struggled illegible coversations for nothing good & paid prime for a year-I DONT HAVE PRIME."
"App extremely slow just to load anything now. Stars are more hidden in search results by shelf only one ⭐, with ""4.3"" next to it. Amazon customer experience getting worse too, the way they hide options to talk to a human. Too many scammy foreign vendors. ADS TOO INTRUSIVE"
"I have two issues with your shopping experience,  1. Not able to install Amazon App for KSA as already have Amazon India app installed on my smart phone.  2. KSA account preferred language is English, even though I'm receiving SMS and emails all in Arabic language.  Please resolve these issues so that I can maximize the shopping through Amazon."
"So far the experience is trash, I've bought like 2 things while the other two sellers never sent me any sort of confirmation"
I've been shopping on Amazon for many years now and the experience has been great. when returns need to be made and the vendor doesn't respond or has very poor customer service. I have always been taken care of by Amazon.
"if there is a half star I will give for the service, it's been almost a week since I've done my order and didn't receive it yet, and when I call the customer service I'm getting stupid answers like because we are changed from Souq to Amazon we are late, and other will tell me about the carrier as I've done the order through carrier not Amazon, and forget to speak to any manager because there is non available on the floor to hear the client issue... the worst experience ever ""First and last time"""
"This so no longer works on tablets like my Samsung Galaxy Tab S7. Shopping is a much more pleasant experience on a tablet as compared to a much smaller phone, yet Amazon supports phones and not tablets. Very frustrating and disappointing."
"Amazon Shopping offers a vast online marketplace with an extensive selection of products. From electronics to fashion, home essentials to books, Amazon provides diverse items. The user-friendly interface, customer reviews, and recommendations make shopping efficient. Fast and reliable delivery options, including Amazon Prime, ensure prompt receipt. Hassle-free return policies and excellent customer service add to the positive experience. Amazon Shopping is the go-to platform."
"I think..the browsing is spot on..much better than all other major shopping chains ,such as Walmart,target etc... Amazon has a simple but elegant online shopping experience..if only they could expand their wish list to include specific members in a House hold such as grandparents,kids .toddlers etc..pass the idea on .. perhaps one day I too will work for Amazon..haha"
"This app is so half baked. It crashes all the time, lists are slow to scroll, touch boxes on everything are super small, and just finicky all around. Trying to use it during prime day was the worst app experience I've ever had."
"Terrible service, even when I pay for Prime, my deliveries are constantly/repeatedly rescheduled days later. They've even been completely lost because the deliverers didnt follow my instructions! Experienced various problems with Amazon.."
"Bad experience. The box was damaged, and i took it anyway, ended up missing items, went on the app, upsss, not eligible for return or refund. I guess people where right, delivery drivers CAN do whatever they want at this company."
"The app doesn't work now? There are no pictures, text or anything aside from menu stuff, but you can't even open up settings. What a weird new shopping experience."
"Great shopping experience however, recently I just received an order and the tracking information has become very slow because it's still saying I have to wait for it; and some of my packages that I'm waiting for don't allow me to view the tracking information."
"Good shopping experience. Downside for me, I have to tap the search icon twice to bring my keyboard. After the first tap it only shows recent search queries. Update: Now works as expected. Thanks"
Get a issue with app nit8ce trying to pick up items at locker. First experience. Untrustworthy. If I can't get these they get returned amd refunded. I am not happy about Amazon's issue. It is creating issues for me!
"Sould come with a warning to it's new members! Something like.. WARNING! THE BENIFITS INCLUDED IN THIS MEMBERSHIP CAN BECOME VERY ADDICTIVE! $12.99 a month and I get an unbelievable shopping experience with amazing options on practically anything and it's delivered quickly to my front door for free! That plus Prime Video make this membership a unmatched, unbeatable, unbelievable benifet to anyone and their family. That's only bragging on 2 of the many behifets included with Amazon's membership!"
"Very bad experience with no commitment for delivery times, and had to finally cancel my order for not able to delivery and useless customer service phone call, and finally waiting for my money to be return !!!! Does not worth wasting time and effort !!!!"
App is overall easy to use but lately has become unresponsive and shuts down constantly and does not make an easy or pleasant shopping experience.I have reported numerous times .Will never join prime because of this issue and will only shop on rare occasions.
"The interface and the arrangement of the products are very very poor in Egypt!! Very few products and very random, it's like walking to a thrift store with everything on top of each other, this is the most unattractive application I've ever seen"
"Can't set currency. App force closes when choosing ZAR. Making it a difficult experience to purchase. No support. I would think twice before opening up shop in SA If you can't fix simple UX issues, you'll get eaten alive."
"This website needs an overhaul to update its options, prices, user interface(access), and efficiency. Had I not known better I may shop here, but eBay, or even Google search, offers a more desired result. I mean, it could be worse, but this is 2019, right?"
"Hi amazon. This is my first time using this app and my experience is very unfortunate for me. During sign in, I forgot my password thus I clicked the ""forgot password"". After I recieved OTP number and enter it, it stated my last 4 digit card number, but that number is NOT SAME with my credit card last 4 digit number. Now I still unable to sign in to my amazon account. PLEASE, HELP ME. PLEASE!"
"I got an email my package was delivered. I immediately go to retrieve it but it's not there. Customer service can't help until 7pm the next day. Meanwhile, the item I ordered sold out. Very disappointing experience and I won't be using Amazon any longer"
"Everything I ordered was on time and ordely; once in a while through all my shopping experiences, there have. Been mistakes, but mostly due to my inexperienced in placing my order."
Shopping experience is starting to degrade when you search for a specific product and brand but amazon shoves 3 pages worth of sponsored product. I should not have to scroll through 3 pages to find my item. Disappointing.
"Amazon no matter what people may say has always been a great experience. I've purchased anything/everything I've ever needed when looking for great prices & quality. Never a problem returning an item. Always a positive resolution. Much more to say, but in the end, Thank you Amazon & it's amazing staff!!!"
The app is slow and has limited features. Changing a shipment address is nearly impossible to do from mobile. The user interface is sometimes unresponsive.
Amazon I think most people know to Amazon isn't I don't think most people have good experiences as I do and I'm not it's a great app again has most things I want but I'd beware just because you use Amazon does not mean they have the lowest price always always always always always shop around to make sure you're getting the good deal thank you
THE USER INTERFACE WAS JUST CHANGED AND THE MENU BAR MOVED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN. THIS IS OPPOSITE OF WHAT IT WAS AND IS NOW DIFFERENT THAN THE MENU BAR LOCATION ON THE WEB APP. WHO MAKES THESE DECISIONS?: VERY BAD AND AWKWARD NOW. IT JUST HAPPENED AGAIN. WHY PUT THE THREE LINE MENU ICON ON THE LOWER PART OF THE SCREEN DIFFERENT THAN ALL OTHER ANDROID APPS.
"Usually a good experience, and decent prices if you shop around for prices."
"Used to be legit... Amazon is nothing but lies these days. The item says, ""arrives TOMORROW, if you buy right now""... I bought 2 different things yesterday that said those very words! Today they haven't even shipped! I ordered them BECAUSE it said arrives tomorrow and that's when I needed them. Chat with customer service and all I get is ""sorry"" for the experience...""I understand why you feel that way""! I don't need sorry, or understanding. I need the items you said you could deliver!"
"So far it's the same ole shopping experience that I used to have. However, every time I go into the app it pops up to download the new version or dismiss. I've already downloaded it! Why does it not acknowledge it. That is very annoying! Please fix this"
"Great products always in time or delivered before they are expected. I have never been disappointed with Amazon! You get what you order exactly! Overall the best shopping and shipping off produts I have ever had, the best experience ever! Thank you Amazon and employees everyone is awesome."
"They lie. They're customer service is a useless joke! You'll wait 20 minutes for a response, only to be told there's nothing they can do! They're allowed to lie to you. They'll make you think, that they've solved the issue... Then; when you complain about it, they say sorry. But that's all they do! Their product's listings are typically lies! Worst experience ever!!!!!! As a prime member for over a decade, I'm leaving Amazon super disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"I have to say that during lockdown, Amazon shopping has (on many occasions) saved my sanity lol. I love to make various things and often need materials for my crafts so it has been amazing to be able to 'click and buy' a plethora of things from fabrics to screws at reasonable prices. Additionally, many of us have experienced lock-down birthdays and certain other celebratory occasions so being able to find gifts and send them directly to said parties, has been conveniently wonderful."
Idk what happened. But today the app isn't working.. won't open. Just shows a white window.. then back to my background. Very strange. I'm on the pixel 4a 5g. Which I got a couple weeks ago. But today's the first issue I've experienced with amazon.
"Why is the app so laggy, I don't like the new interface at all!!! I'm trying to find items, my orders, taking forever to load one image... why fix what wasn't broken.. get rid of this stupid update, waste of resources and customers aren't happy, I'm very close to not ordering anything through this app at the moment. 🙄😒"
"Use to love the app, but now it is sluggish, it flashes white randomly and puts me back at the home page while I'm looking at items. It's just an unpleasant experience in it's current state. Will update if things improve."
"It's an extreme painful and slow experience not most times, all the time. Hugely privacy invading, even if having never opened the app. Use the website instead, on a desktop."
It is a very good app. The only thing that you must receive your items personally. I had a bitter experience with Amazon. I have ordered 2 plastic chairs and I was not in the house when they come to deliver. They given the item to my neighbor as my adviced. But they delivered only one plastic chair instead of two.
"Prime membership is a trap, watch out! I have cancelled it twice and it keeps activating itself without my consent. Customer service could not solve it as my kids streamed prime videos accidentally. Really bad experience, I thought Amazon is more professional than trying to trick it's customers this way!"
"Amazon is the worst online portal ever. It's has such a rigid and non user friendly interface and the delivery network is the worst. I ordered a product which took one week to ship and by the time of delivery, the delivery guy rescheduled the delivery himself and then I got mail that I canceled the order and returned the product which I didn't and on checking with the customer support they told the product got damaged and hence cannot be delivered and so the money will be refunded."
"Our family shops amazon through both, the Amazon app, or through our browser. Amazon Fresh and Amazon Prime shopping experience is the best!! We use Amazon for everything... Pet supplies and pharmacy delivery. But look all, the truffle cakes and peach pie on Amazon Fresh are delicious 🤤 Im eating chocolate truffles cake now 🤣! Had a slice peach pie warmed with butter earlier yummy! And they wrap their eggs, desserts and frozen stuff really good. Oh oh they just dropped off our dog food🐕"
Shame on you amazon for ruining my UI experience. You forcefully inserted amazon option when I select any text to copy or paste and did it sneakingly. Also how can Google allow this to just sneak through? Deleting the app now as it is now intrusive in basic functions of my phone.
Terrible experience so far. got an amazon gift card and i put money on my balance and i tried to buy a DIGITAL CODE and i get an error and it removed from my cart and then asked to set my default address when i already have one added. i've tried everything and nothing has changed.
Very Bad experience and no refund for the products or a new products. I had put a review for the seller but they didn't approve it bcoz there was Amazon's bad review too. So beware when you purchase an expensive item from Amazon. Bcoz after the products comes to your hand The Seller and The Amazon company won't help you at all.
When you shop with ebt you have to look all ova the place for items. The food shopping experience is terrible. It needs to be more organized and stream lined as if you were shopping in a grocery store. Also how come I cant have my groceries delivered to my home? I have prime. I am an older individual. This is not acceptable to the american people who spent money with your corporation.
TERRIBLE app. Since the last update the whole interface is not user friendly. None of my previous orders are available to view. Why did you change the app Amazon? Look at all the poor reviews and take note!
Amazon is a great resource that provides a ton of wonderfully priced items at the click of a button. I have had nothing but great experiences with purchasing items & will continuously do so.
"A very bad application, slow and not secure with information. I greatly regret this experience and wasted my money on this nonsense. It is really a bad application and does not deserve one star. I do not advise anyone to download it or deal with that company because it is completely unreliable. It does not even deserve one star. It is truly unfortunate."
Very bad experience with amazon. They are using local things. In the picture they will show nice things but when you will get totally different. Very very bad experience with amazon.
"Updated to 4 star. Except some delivery restrictions from amazon in Ireland (no grocery, no power banks, lithium batteries...) , this app itself has good user interface and easy access to actually live customer service chat."
"The app keeps freezing my entire phone. With as much money as we give Amazon, they can certainly afford to provide us with a better app experience."
Recent updates to the app have caused frequent freezes and crashes. I have a S23 ultra 512gb and this app should not be this slow and buggy. Highly frustrating user experience.
"Idk what they did to this app, but it keeps freezing and crashing as I'm trying to scroll through products. It's an awful experience and it hasn't done this ever until recently."
"Payment interface is too bad , success rates has drastically reduced. Lot of failures or pending status seen these days. Needs quick fix from Amazon for such important issues"
"Worst supermarket delivery experience. They put food products, cleaning products and cosmetics within the same package. I've complained 100 times, nothing happened and still suffering from this issue!!"
I used to be a big time fan of Amazon until I recently had the unpleasant experience of having a package stolen because a hairbrain driver left the package down by the road on our recycling bins! Now I am inconvenienced by a signature required to deliver !?!. ..what a put off.
Horrible shopping experience - item inventory on the app is not accurate. Purchases do not arrive on time even with priority delivery. Poor customer service.
"They make Unsubscribing prime membership very very difficult. I was charged for prime when I was purchasing some items, I have called them and subscription was made my mistake and they confirmed they will give the money refunded buy until now it is not refunded. It is a worst experience"
My shopping experiences with Amazon have been great. I'm always treated as a valuable client and have received excellent service and quick resolutions for the few times I have had problems with a product or merchant.
If you have two accounts and you're on the one with your name you can't switch the other one and it keeps showing that you have no Amazon Prime when I do and it keeps charging me $14 every two weeks for Amazon Prime which I already get for free through my phone company he won't answer it don't return any emails is a crappy company that does not have very good customer service at least for my experience they are charging me with no authorization and I have free Prime which I don't need to pay for
"Horrible experience with Amazon. Placed a big order with them took 30 minutes for Amazon to take my money almost $600. Then they closed my account for 24 hours. After, reinstating my account finally they cancelled all my order but I still have pending purchase from Amazon on my bank which now I can't place my kids Christmas and have to wait 7-10 business days to get my refund on my account (need I remind you they took my money from account literally 30 mins after I placed my order) this is BS."
"Horrible customer service. This is easily the 20th product I've had a late arrival on and they are doing nothing about it. Even had something ""guarenteed"" for christmas and it showed up 2 days AFTER. Customer service was unapologetic, and did not right any wrongs. Canceling my service and I will have others do the same. Horrible experience."
"I used to love this service. But now it is almost impossible to communicate with customer support. Absolutely awful online shopping experience now, if something goes wrong. And things DO go wrong once in a while if you shop enough. I realize that's the nature of the business, but please fix your customer ""support"" department. Right now?: Zero stars if I could. I'm done with Amazon for now."
"look up the item you require, order it, get it. Best shopping experience ever"
"Amazing shopping experience, although Aramex lost my package once but I still got a full refund from Amazon"
"The worst shopping app We bought a tv (hisense) after 3 months it get frezz on a black screen We called them to fix or return it They told us we gonna get a call to make an appointment after 12 days max. But it's been 17 days there's no call.as well they just sent a email to say: turn the TV off, delet the data ..etc Really? After 17 days u just giving us that stupid solution Of course this not the only bad experience there's many. You guys Ruining a reputation of ur company litterly. 0 /10"
"Very bad user experience, will take the whole day to open a single page"
Great experience but to easy to hit the buy button
My experience with this application was very exciting I enjoyed the conversation questions and the answer them to the best of
"Horrible and lazy customer service I ever experienced, been having my account under investigation for the past 5 years. I love amazon and everything. I had also made new accounts with new emails I made during the 5 year period, each one get cancel and under Investigation due to having some personal information as my first account and saying it's fraud. But no one in amazon is helping me at all."
"Access popular pages quickly with our new shortcuts. Tap and hold the Amazon app icon to access your Orders, Daily Deals, Shopping Cart, and Search. AmazonSmile customers can now generate donations for their favourite charity. Just open Settings from the menu and tap AmazonSmile. Enjoy our latest update where we have fixed some bugs and improved our app to provide you a seamless shopping experience."
"How can a company as big as Amazon allow an application to be published with such poorly developed interface, with so many glitches and an incredible lack of features/search filters, if we compare it to applications like ""ebay"" for example, it should even embarrass the person in charge of supervising and approving the development of this Amazon's application."
"Nightmarish experience. Ordered soap, when it was delivered there was only 1 bar when it should've been 6. So a replacement was supposedly sent but when it came it was a ripped, empty package. So got ahold of support again and they never helped me to resolve this issue in fact they did even not to help, so I never got the soap. Very rude and combative customer service. I will probably end up closing my account. If I could give a -0,I would"
"Passable. The overall app experience has moments which feel similar to dealing with an absent or inattentive waiter at a restaurant; by that, I mean server requests that never go through, infinite loading times, and lots of refreshing/relaunching the app."
"Made it extremely difficult to request refunds, I spent approx 300$ and nothing arrived, Correct address, neighbors didn't get it, Just nothing, and I've only managed to get TWELVE dollars back, It's genuinely been my worst experience with online shopping, I'll never be using Amazon again unless this issue was somehow fixed"
"They sent me a trailer hitch and all the install hardware was missing. They refuse to give me a refund or send me new hardware. Now I'm out $140 plus 40 for shipping. Now they won't let me leave a review so i can't let others know of my horrible experience. BUYER BEWARE, DO NOT BUY FROM THESE SCAM ARTISTS!"
Not as rich an environment as the standard web site experience. For any serious shopping I use the web browser. I typically just use the app to check on existing orders. It's a decent enough app but I just prefer the web site overall
My very first experience with Amazon was a failure and I will never use them again. I tried purchasing a laptop and the order just kept on delaying. I contacted Amazon customer service and they could not help me. After speaking with 4 different helpline officials on 4 different occasions they finally decide to refund me. But they could never refund me the time they waisted if I would have known my package will never show up. I am disappointed and will never use Amazon again.
Update: This app is still borderline useless. It takes FOREVER to load. How is your development team making the user experience worse with each update?! Stop with the counter intuitive updates. This most recent update causes the app the freeze while scrolling. Are you all testing before releasing these updates?!
"The constant pop-up ads when launching the app have broken click-through from the notification bar. Consider using banner ads instead; otherwise, only the web interface is useable."
My experience with Amazon shopping app as been pretty messed up to be honest with you. Because of your improperly conducted customer service team. Very inexperienced support members and poor communication and technical support. Have a nice day.
Last major update solved my impulse shopping habit by rendering the experience so slow that I have plenty of time to rethink purchases! Not sure that's the smartest business model though... 10 out 10! Would not check out again!
"Just love shopping on Amazon, ebooks are one second away from my kindle reading, orders of items are easy, and prime membership gives so much avantages all around. The best shopping experience you can have out there !"
Very bad experience. Never pay for any product untill it is delivered. Always pay by cash or else the product will reach you in their sweet time. Since three days the product is showing that it is on its way but not reaching me . And the customer service is so bad that they hear the problem for the first time and then they forget it . If called again line busy
"Amazon closed my account for ""Our records show that we previously closed an account of yours for violating the terms of our Conditions of Use agreement"", I don't have any other accounts. I had to uninstall the app after trying to contact Amazon by email & phone to know the reason and they gave me no reason. Thank you Amazon for bad experience."
"The new Amazon app interface is now cloud based. And badly designed. A horrible upgrade. If you want the old one back. Just uninstall this junk app, go search for old version apks, and install version 20.15.0.100. Fixed."
App even more annoying than the Amazon website: constantly pushing prime and with a confusing interface to try ans get you accidentally buy it. Was promised £10 for using this and didn't get it. I'd rather just use the website in browsing.
"I'd never used Amazon before. In my first experience I got scammed by a fake seller in China. The customer service rep also didn't do what they said they were going to do and because of that, I can't receive the items that DID ship. Horrible service. Never going to use it again. (And nothing had 2 day shipping)"
App is really easy to use and browse. can find almost anything on here and the recommendations of similar items are typically worth a look as well. good experience!
I use Amazon for everything. The shipping is fast. if something is damaged they are very easy to work with to get the problem fixed. Just over all amazing doing experience.
"Very bad experience two times same problem; the pack didn't get on time, both delivered by ""Amazon Logistics"" the second time followed by the last one, seems like a bad joke, 5 phone calls in 24 hours weren't enough to try to avoid their bad service, absolutely I will stop buying from you, and once I reach the one year period of the membership I will cancel the membership and I will talk about it on Twitter."
"Very poor experience, the logistic delivery are calling to you and asking the location thru watsapp after i send the location, he said that im on my way to your location and you will wait for morethan 4hours, otherwise if you are not call them they cannot tell to you that they will not come, they will tell that because of location is very far. Very bad experience of this logistics, they can only select what location they want to deliver. Bad experience from AMAZON UAE."
"This is THE consistently worst, most unprofessional, undependable app & custm. service I think I've ever experienced. I think 75-90% of every order over 8years been messed up in some way. Even supervisors can't walk u thru the app to fix things. 2hr+ call AGAIN yesterday! Verification is worst also as (in name of safety😂) u must waste time literally spell out ur address, email, etc to complete stranger every time vs password. When ironically almost any1 smart enough can get this online anyway."
"Horrible customer experience. Trying to get my order and i keep on getting told it will be dispatched within 48 hours every time i contact customer service. Every time i contact them again, they just cancel my chat or I get passed arround like i am a nuisance. Canceling my subscription and buying straight from the vendor from now on rather the supporting this horrible company."
very bad experience. when i order something this app show me after 2 or 3 days deliver your products but after they cancelled. Two times Cancelled my order by the amazon delivery man and bring it to refund money. why they not send to my address.
My experience with Amazon was very good and now don't at all the is the same
"""oh no your Amazon prime account is running out"" -yes I know, I did it myself! My main criticism of this app is that once you view something you get endless ads for the same thing with little or no alternative products shown. Apart from this it is a well designed interface"
ive been using this app for years. very rarely do i experience any issues. love it.
"This app doesn't scroll the screen up when trying to chat with a customer support agent, making it where you can't see what you're typing cause it's behind your keyboard. Typical useless pretense for getting around your adblocker that can't even give a proper equivalent experience to your browser."
"Agree with all recent sentiments. Amazon's unnecessary bombardment of tracking and advertising is making their application feckless. Their search engine is ""seller centric"" as the search results are are all ridden with sponsored outcomes. They're unquestionably the most successful retailer in history thanks to loyal customers who keep coming back. When will they have enough? When will they feel like making the customer experience a priority again?"
"Amazon is allways on point with everything.great customer service,they get back to you quickly and allways resolve any issues or qwestion u may have.i have not had one bad experience with them and I will continue to use them in the future.highley recommend to anyone that needs anything.👍👍"
Super easy shopping experience! Trustworthy products and great customer service.
"The housing took a little effort to fit into my projector but once in it was perfect! I am very satisfied especially after the very bad experience I had with another purchase. My projector is now as good as new. Thanks guys, good product"
Horrible delivery experience multiple times
Chat agents are horrible and unhelpful. They close out the chat before the issue is resolved in order to keep from being rated poorly. When an agent closes out the chat it asks you and prompts you to rate them. When they do a poor job they're immediately closing out the chat to keep from being negatively rated! Horrible experience!! They need better training.
Amazon is by far my favourite online shopping experience. The app dose exactly what the website dose. Its so easy to browse and use. I am prime customer which is a bonus for anyone with prime as you get so many great benefits with it.
"Where to write review regarding delivery agent?. The delivery service of bukariya region in buraidah , alquassim,Saudi Arabia is too bad. The behaviour of the delivery agent isn't good. Also they will ask you the location but after that they will not Informe us what time will be the expected delivery. We have to expect the delivery whole day. They will call you once they reached our door step and not willing to wait for us even for5 minutes. I have this bad experience every time."
"I was a bit sceptical at first, but I absolutely love it.. No hassles, no problems, customer service is very helpful, very happy with my purchases and actually surprised by the great quality so far and fast 😯, they don't mess around when it comes to delivering. Life changing experiences.. saw some things I dreamt of for a fair price delivered quickly and here I am living the dreams 😎👍 I'm a completely satisfied customer. My adult version of the icecream truck lol"
Very easy app to get around! The shopping experience is extermely enjoyable as well. Great reviews on the products you are considering and I love getting to make my custom wish lists. This app literally does EVERYTHING!
"Absolutely abysmal experience. Long delays after button presses, often leading to no response. Overall slow and unresponsive. No option to use the old Amazon app which worked fine."
Ny experience was disgusting because I ordered a parcel that by the way has still not arrived despite the fact that amazon are still promising it. The day after the parcel was meant to arrive amazon said that if it hadn't cone the next day they would refund me so it did t come and I came back for a refund then amazon decided to add on an extra 4 days so again I patiently waited for the 4 days and still it wasn't here so I message them and they won't get back to me
"I mean its Amazon, it is what it is. This is more on the app experience and its pretty good. No crashes, no slowdown and works 1:1 with the desktop version."
"The new update completely ruined the perfect experience I had. It does not load, it crashes and things are harder to find. Something simple was ruined."
Horrible experience with the app constantly freezing or pages not loading.
"Frustrating experience trying to shop wishlists. Why can't I find a list in the app when I know the name of and can l successfully access it via browser? It's not my list or a friend's I can have ""invite"" me. The link to the list works fine everywhere but the app"
"I love the experience of shopping with Amazon. You can find anything you need from with a wide selection of products at a price to suit anyone's pocket, and get them delivered to your door, or if it is a gift for someone it can be sent direct to them. 👍😁"
"Very bad in terms of delivery experience. The delivery timing is from 9AM to 9PM, they don't give you the option to choose your preferred delivery time, which means you have to wait for them from 9AM to 9PM so you don't have to do any other thing in your life for 12 hours. The delivery staff will not even call you at least 1 hour before the reach you, you just receive a phone call telling you that I've arrived to your delivery location. This is very bad experience with such company like Amazon."
"Their experience is worse, I have been waiting for 2 days for their so called fast delivery and still waiting, they don't have an option to call the delivery where the package is, their user experience sucks, the customer care is just playing around transferring chat to one another, I am deleting my account and that's the last time I have ordered."
I had a very terrible experience with this service. They do not listen or solve issues. I emailed and called and nothing has been done. All I wanted was to buy a book but I can't even use the giftcard money that I have on the account to order it.
II chuck every years and retested the app again and again ending up with headache again. The app never finds what you want and offers what they(Amazon)wants! I can online advise to KEEP AWAY FROM AMAZON. Its still the same horrible shopping experience like years ago.
worst experience with AMAZON.Even Prime members can't get on time delivery.I have too many times this experience.
"It was such a horrible experience, since I've downloaded it like three weeks ago, all it brings is ""something went wrong"" or ""try again"". I've barely been able to do 1 task from it since then. It's not working fine at all, it is the worst of it."
"Sometimes the application shows me a white screen while I'm trying to get my package from a locker. Personally, I don't like the interface of the app Edit: After the all, there is only one star. This app is a disgrace to the company."
"I am a prime member for many years. In this 2 or 3 years, I experienced buying from scam-sellers. The scam-sellers wrote their description nicely. But the product I received is not as described. I did sent review for those scam-sellers, but surprisingly, amazon asked me to edit my review, because my review is not postable. What Amazon expect me to write? Should I give them a good review, but in fact, I got scammed?"
The team member (Sandeep i believe) was very human like and I greatly appreciate that after he recognized my way of communicating he was legit and honest. I always thought Amazon help was a robot helping you out. Never before have I had such a real experience with a team member I honestly never expected this at all....Although it seemed kinda fake when I was trying to speak with a manager about this great experience but unfortunately there was no way of doing so. If real he deserves credit 👏
"Getting pretty tired of being ""guaranteed delivery"" on a certain date only to find out when the item is due that ... The item will be delivered some time within the next week. Guaranteed means nothing with Amazon. Update 2023 Amazon has the worst customer service I've ever experienced aside f Rogers. Rude mouthy agents on top of incorrect information."
I like the new design but opening the app from recent apps puts you in a glitches interface. With 2 search bars you only have the option to hit back and it closes the app.
Always had a great experience with my RBC account to help me with my Amazon purchases.. Only 1 thing missing is the temp.overdraft I always had at the months end. Its now gone and I always needed it for protection in order to help me with my groceries. I never made a mistake with it and for 6 six months ive been short.The RBC always got it back. Thankyou for all the other things ive experiences at RBC.
"I have had only good experiences shopping with Amazon. shipping is fast, returns/exchanges are easy and I often price check so I know I am getting the best deals. I use the app on Android so convenient."
My experience with this app was horrible. They put my account on hold when I was trying to make an order. I am unable to log back into my account. My orders have not gone through. Also I can't check my account balance so I have no idea if my money is still there. I am going to file an complaint as this is unacceptable.
"My Recommendation: [Recommended] My Experience: The user interface, the shopping experience and the way Amazon customer service is amazing! Make sure you write fair reviews for the sellers. Some items can be bought much cheaper on Aliexpress (same items)"
Ebay is a lot easier to get your money back from an undelivered package. And they dont have a send Jeff's friends to space fee. And the amazon search interface is useless to find what you're actually searching for.
"The changes to the interface of the app makes it extremely difficult to find what I was used to . The warehouse Deals section has done away with a whole bunch of departments, or has made it impossible to find."
Well hell it was good. Now I'm forced to give it one Star. #1. There you go screwing up the interface of the App. Now everything is everywhere WOW. Totally FUBAR. #2. Why is it that your site says my items were delivered but they weren't. Go to usps site and it says it's still at the hub. Get your system right.
"Very bad experience, delivery man was so unhelpful and they are supporting bad people."
E-Z Pea-Z....seamless shopping experience.! Reliable shipping and arrival experiences.
"Some of the listed items are actually ""pre order"" items which are listed as in stock. There should be more clarity on the availability of items listed. Out of 5 items purchased, maybe 1 or 2 are available, the rest are either nil stock or pre ordered with long (40~60 days) waiting time. An unpleasant shopping experience."
Pay for prime and I always have bad experiences when packages are delivered by USPS last USPS delivery they placed my package in the building next to me I don't understand if im paying for an Amazon service then why doesn't Amazon deliver it.. And USPS does not follow instructions I've set in the app.
"my experience is that Amazon pushes people, vendors, and manufacturers around using their money for their might. they have on many occasions started replicating very popular and best selling products and undercutting the competition's prices to the point they can't sell in that market and pull their inventory ×while Amazon sits back and looks for another way to stick it to the very same people that made them the big time business they are."
"love my experience with Amazon, great customer service and friendly shopping app."
"F for effort. In all honesty you're better off using their website on your cellphone. Don't waste your time with downloading it, just use the website in the end it's far more intuitive. Plus the interface looks fugly. Light blue and brown, old lady hospital swag."
The app has a horrible interface. Cant filter the results. Cant track courier comes with delay gives wont tracjing number. Not even going to bother to explain everything else worng about this app and its services. Cant be compared to hepsiburada and trendyol.
"I pay forprime service but still get so many commercials of amazonpushing their shows. Plus it bias unwanted advertising. As a person of color, im tired or seeing sll these commercials and they are mostly Caucasian American faces. Not only are they forcing ads on a paid service but they dont care to even consider the importance or represention. There shouldnt be ads at all for such a high prime fee but you add insult to injury by only portraying the Caucasian image, life and experiences."
"Ever since the app was updated a while back with the menu along the bottom, I've found it's really laggy and clunky. It's not a good user experience."
the best shopping experience ever
"I have always had a great experience with Amazon whether it be their digital libraries or just ordering some regular items...They have always come through time and time again, do all they can to make sure I am happy."
"Worse shopping experience ever. The UI looks like a vomit, orders are cancelled for no obvious reason and there is no customer support whatsoever (you can contact them but you will never get answered)"
If you multitaks through apps to take a look at your credit card for example it refreshes and you can not write your card because of that. I am not gonna write down on a paper(don't even have paper and pen with me) just to pay on amazon. I will just go and shop on ebay.. thx . Horrible experience
"Nont good service, bed experience"
"The app experience is abysmal. It's impossible to find item, items have no prices before adding them to cart, items don't load properly. It's definitely better to use website."
Great store great shopping experience great service great for my business
It has become easy to navigate due to my experience on the app. But when do we get the option of DARK THEME for the app? It's too bright for my eyes. It would be awesome to have that option available.
Nothing but good experiences from them very professional.
"Being an Amazon Prime member, it's always a great experience 👍🏼"
"Amazon is the worst company to deal with they will advertise something but yet they do not deliver on their promises, i think Jeff doesn't care about refunding your money back to you, his company block my and my wife number sample because they were caught in the web of lies, also if you leave in a black community they do not get confirmations rather their products haved actually being deliver or not am speaking from experience but in my white neighborhood i get pictures confirmations each time."
"my experience sucks because I ordered a mower belt that was promised by March 6 last minute they said it would be delayed until the 12,top that off they want let me cancel the order"
Simple shopping experience
always a good experience using amazon online
I have had very bad experience with Amazon 3 different times
"I just had the worst experience in my life with Amazon. I had to call and reorder over 5 time, each time I get a lie from the cs, from the 2nd reorder I asked cs to send with a different delivery they agree, but send wit the same worst delivery service ""Hermes"", this loop of order reorder never stopped I sent the packet to a packet hub ""first time I do that"" the guy who assisted me gave me wrong hub number, this whole caused the system to block the payment method.. Thanks for the experience 😞👎"
Worst UI for e-commerce app ever ! no clear categories and when filtration lots of results disappears ! please you are even way far from old Souq App interface ! I'm currently find it very difficult to shop comparing with old Souq app or comparing with competitors like Noon or Namshi ! i don't recomend to use it ever !
New interface of Amazon app on Andriod has declined from what is was. The listing of clicking next everytime you want to see a list of products past a short list is painful and the results output on a search are quite fidgety now. Why change it if is wasn't broken?
"I shop Amazon a lot these days because I don't live close to shopping centers and I have to say, my experience has been good. My family says I shop too much but I like nice things and I like to try new things all the time. I haven't been disappointed with any of my orders thus far, and shipping is always fast and on time. I would recommend everyone to shop Amazon. I would order every day if I could . I think I'll try to get a job enspecting products and giving my opinion on what they sell."
My expectation is experience based on other people's experience using Amazon. Ive yet to use Amazon. Downloading the app is Pending. Ive bought a new sd card. App Still pending. But i look forward to shopping.
"I don't like when they change the user interface, it makes it complicated and frustrating to find things that use to be easy to find. Definitely impacts how much I'll be buying"
"Appsolutely appalling experience with Amazon support. ""The search engine is working as intended"" Is the only answer anyone seems to be able to get out of them when inquiring why search results primarily include completely unrelated products that are sponsored rather than what the customer's looking for. Looking for a new phone case? We have 5000 results of which we will only show you 300. 250 of which are unrelated (covid masks, and other unrelated products). Stop pushing your junk on me..."
"My experience was horrible, due to because they won't tell me how much in total I have to pay nor I understand where should I check my money. And everything is so expensive with taxes? Wanted to buy some chairs and bought $400 gift cards but in total of buying those chairs were 500$ even though the chairs are only 119$ chairs come in with 2 so we bought 3 packs of chairs and I added it up it was less then $500?? Like explain? Also as if they don't want you checking how much money you have."
My experience has been pretty good buying things. But When it comes to writing reviews of the products I buy. They ask me to rate the product. I have no problem with that. But they send me messages from other people asking questions. They don't pay me for that. And that need to start doing for people even if it's a discount on the next order or something.
You're loosing a customer of 10 years because you lost your way Amazon. The main focus of Amazon for years was customer service and the easy seemless shopping experience. That's no longer the case now. Rates keep going up to fund side projects like prime video even if you don't use it. They force 2 factor authentication without consent nor will they remove it when it's locking people out of their accounts. Take away freedom of choice and people are going to leave.
Adding all these videos and other selling tactics is impeding my shopping experience. Screen is freezing. Can't scroll down to view anything. What's going on???
nearly impossible to talk with a support agent. Amazon is making the process of talking with a human very difficult on purpose. Shameful experience.
"Pathetic, Unstable & Uncertain! Apps are developed to make shopping experience pleasing & convenient, but this app is not even ready to launch and they made Souq app offline to promote this. Next thing where is my wishlist from Souq aap, those items were having a possibility to be an potential order in coming future, which you lost. Good Luck for all the millions of wishlist items, which you lost; from thousands of Souq app user."
"Not at all recommending.My most of the experiences are bad at Amazon.I never received the item I ordered.I've ordered 4 times n 3 times i received wrong orders.I never ordered from Amazon but ever since souq has merged into Amazon, I started ordering from amazing. And it's exact opposite of souq.Souq services were better compared Amazon. Amazon's services are the worst.I had refunded my order(wrong order) n still I didn't get money transferred in my account. And I refunded it a month ago."
I've had excellent experience with Amazon return to easy deliveries on time
"Yeah, NO! The back button functionality is completely broken. It skips stuff and reloads constantly. Filters constantly get reset. Not a good experience 👎"
"WHAT experience??????? All I get is your smiley saying to update, and when I do I get another screen saying to ope. Then, when I hit the open button, it goes back to the screen with the smiley face. I can't even get into the App to do my shopping or to purchase anything!!!!!! It's ""F""ing ""BS"". If it isn't fixed in the next few days I'm going to cancel your app and notify b my new service provider and my old service provider that your App is now PURELY BOGUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Lately I been having the worst experience with Amazon customer service I just bought 8pedialyte and it said clearly to contact customer service to get a refund or a replacement and the customer service in English(indue)are so rude..and the spanish they're nicer but they still act like they don't have an option and how to help me I send them screenshots of the app saying that. I can return the item by June 2nd and another screenshot saying contact customer service I feel like I got rob be careful
"I have had a few problems but, Amazon has always corrected them and made my experience more then great.... I order all my needs from hair products, Makeup to Ear buds and clothes etc. All types of products for myself and my son.... love being a prime member also!!!"
"I've always had great experiences finding good deals and fast delivery. With prime it's even better. Faster and free. Your offers stay in your account so you can reorder, and info so you can return or exchange.You can buy food, like groceries."
"I know you have a lot of dark things to hide when you delete honest bad reviews. So try it with me. On with my experience. So far, customer service has been nothing but full of scammers. I wanted to delete my account completely due to my issues with Prime, and they tried to scam me of my email and such when I explained the issue. Then, after making a review, they remove it. Next step is going to be a lawsuit if this continies. Don't think we won't turn you over."
Worst experience in last few weeks. I initiated return but no one came to pick up the item and I tried to call they blocked my number. There is no email preference available. Even one star is too much
"The old version was much better, the new interface makes no sense, there's no logic in how you navigate around the app. Please go back to the old version, was was great."
"From my experience this app provided ZERO advantage over just pulling Amazon up on Chrome. On the other hand this app is a real dog. It's so slow it continuously times out and I'm asked if I want to close the app or WAIT. So if you want to spend your time waiting for an app to respond, this one's for you."
Honestly... The app is slow. The app layout sucks. The performance is poor. The interface is confusing. The products are all Chinese ****. The backstack management is poor at best.
Had one of the most horrible experience with Amazon delivery where my order was supposed to be delivered today at my office i.e. before 6pm. There was no communication or update from Amazon team and despite of my several follow ups they were not able to give me any update of my delivery. I waited outside my office building for 3 hours as they kept telling me that the rider is on the way & in the same area. Please be careful while ordering as they have no clue on how to track orders. Pathetic!!
"By far the worst experience I've ever had with Amazon I'm now losing $9,000 a day over and $86 credit that they will not issue because it's from a third-party seller who's already refunded the money on top of that I've never been treated so rudely by customer service the last package I ordered before this time I still have not received and I ordered on December 27th you would think a company as big as Amazon w would just issue a credit for $100 by the end of this I'll be out $90 k thanks Amazon"
"Bad experience using this app, many times i order a product to deliver in 24 hour and they deliver a wrong product and the fault from thier side, and the customer have to wait for one week to send the right item ordered. I dont recommend to use this app specially in egypt. For sure they have very bad local staff."
Very good experience with the people who is the best Thks for the packages and the items
"Good shopping experience fast delivery, but prices are higher than another company's"
"They stole over $500 from me, customer service is utterly useless-disgusting experience, would not recommend this service to anybody. Stay well clear"
My experience with Amazon is really good I just like being able to go and look at things I may want to get and maybe even get what I was wanting to get without even leavening my home its a wonderful way to shop everyone should have access to it and take full advantage of it for sure it really works out good for me I really injoy it for sure
Practical shopping experience. Shipping much better than Ebay sellers.
Awesome User Interface! Very easy to use!
"Terrible interface for an internet based company, extremely rarely on time"
My experience was everything and I appreciate them and the delivery drivers for all their hard work 👍👍👍
I think the shopping experience & awesome deals rocks
Amazom experience overall is a 4.9 out of 5. that is from many years and many purchases and returns. I have made physicle and electronic(kindle) purchases and other companies could learn much from The customer service. i am just sad that my experiences do not hold up to what i hear as far as how they treat wearhouse workers. We just had a Amazon worker killed not 10 miles from my home doing his job. any company can never put profits over people.
We Love shopping with Amazon! Awesome experience every time! Thank you...
"Hi there, I'm writing this review for bad delivery experience I ever face on my life. I placed an ordered a week ago and supposed to they deliver today as per their notify. I was happy to see my stuff after long waited. *Wait a second* I got message from Amazon. they notify me your stuff were delivered. I was surprize. How? I haven't received yet my stuff. But I got message your items were delivered. How the stupid delivery person. They handovers to someone else. At least they had to inform me."
"It's very bad experience. They just cancelled my order, that was just 15 km away from my home. I was waiting for product from 5 days. They give me foolish reason, can't deliver on your address. I will never buy anything from Amazon. It's very very bad experience. I am too angry."
"S+00p1d updates! The new interface ain't user friendly. It is designed to make everything difficult, and to make sure you can't find the cancel button for Prime."
Very disappointed with the new app. It makes the shopping experience tiresome. Now you need to chek if the product you are ordering comes from amazon fresh or prime. The previous amazon prime app was so much better.
"The app works well enough. Amazon as a service industry, well... Customer service has really taken a dive of late. I mean, it was never really ""good"". Mediocre at best was my previous experience. Today... Terrible. In short... DO NOT RELY ON AMAZON FOR TIMELY DELIVERIES FOR THE 2020 HOLIDAYS!"
"The latest app version takes a massive move towards hiding statistics from consumers in the way it displays reviews info on the search pages. Sure it's a ""fancy and clean"" interface but it's less beneficial for consumers"
"Tried to log in mutiple times and it fails me, once I eventually do log in it says ""oops error"" something went wrong whenever i try to buy something. Honestly the most horrible experience and customer service cant help me at all 🙄"
Quick and simple shopping experience
"Absolutely The worst Customer service I have ever experienced, I called into cancel my account because they keep double charging my visa, I asked to speak to a supervisor and when I was transferred he told me that he couldn't help me and I would have to call back in, I am beyond frustrated with this company right now"
Lately the Amazon shopping experience sucks. Inaccurate and conflicting product info on just about everything. Wrong sized items sent and some products look like returns.
Please roll back latest update!!! Awefull light blue color scheme and it's now merged with more than my shopping app. It has movies which I don't care for. I think. I'll use a different shopping app now. Horrible experience now since latest update. Too confusing
"There's a beautiful story here, even if your app and website look like they're from 2005 and the user interface is completely counterintuitive and confusing, you can still, against all odds, become the biggest online retailer in the world. Dream big guys, dream big."
"Piss poor customer service. Tried to buy a gift card, Amazon locked me out of my account and when I called them to verify my account they would only say that my account was on hold. Never offered to restart my order. Never tried to authenticate and unlock my account. When I asked to speak to a supervisor the know-nothing representative refused. I've been with Amazon for about 10 years and will be deleting my account after this experience."
"It used to be simple to use and easy to navigate, but they keep changing the user interface which requires you to RELEARN where everything is. Not easy to use if you keep changing the way you use it."
"Other than the increasing prices, which aren't in Amazon's control, my only complaint is that not many items can be received the next day anymore. Otherwise the shopping experience is quick and easy!"
I was forced to resort to this app since the orginial one expired/went away. Doesn't have the simple organized interface of the orginal and it has been shutting down for 1.5 days now. :/
I have never experienced an app this slow and laggy. I only downloaded because the web browser made me to connect to customer service and the app is horrible compared to any other app I've used. Sticking to online web platform.
I love the convenience. Never have any problems come up to ruin the experience. Now with the blessing of getting so much online it saves me shopping which is too difficult for me.
"The ""next"" button is keeps me from wanting to continue with Amazon. Oh well time to shop some other place or app. I already unsubscribed to prime. Apparently they dont want a hassle free shopping experience for us. ok"
Hate the new update! Interface is not user friendly! Please revert back or at least give users the option to toggle between old and new interface.
"How is this experience better than just going to the web site. Is this a hint that you are going to discontinue having an app at all. You may as well, with this current place holder of an app. Fix this! You can start by bringing back drag and drop list. I cannot fathom why you would get rid of a feature that made shopping and organization easier for you members. It's baffling. Give your members a reason to use this app. Put back this feature and other you have no doubt read that others miss."
"Amazon is Amaz-ing! Number 1 online shopping period. The website is so easy to you, fastest free shipping, and great quality products, if you don't like something they even have free returns. You have to experience the Amazingness yourself..get shopping NOW!!!"
"Overall good experience except I had a previous user that I couldn't use anymore because they said I had violated one of the policies and procedures. only referencing the entire policy and procedure manual which is tens of thousands of words, but not stating specifically what I had violated. So I question whether I violated something or not or just possibly they misunderstood something I wrote, or wht. If it was something they read into which wasn't what I meant how can I correct in future?!"
This new interface is by far the worst thing ever. I cannot find anything. The bar at the bottom is beyond stupid and the categories and where things are found are even more stupid. Did you guys actually have UX? I would be surprised. Its been a month and i still cant adjust to it.
"To be honest this app is the best way how not to get scammed but here's my issues, i ordered 3 stuff and it never told me it got shipped or was delivered and it isn't on my ""Your Orders"" So i think i got scammed but they did email me that i order them. And i ordered other stuff and it came in a month a freaking month and the 2 days shipping is totally a scam i remember 3 months ago i ordered a fan for my ps4 and it said get it 2 days got it in like 2 weeks. Thats my experience."
"Since the latest update, the app sometimes fails to open and I can no longer find the notifications button. Therefore a poor experience. Go back to the previous version."
"Browser based experience is much better than the app. App is intrusive, always logged in. Difficult to exit and log out. Disorganized and disconnected. Chaotic experience."
Was once a reliable company. Experience has recently gone down. Packages not being received or late. If you are going to provide expedition then the speed being received needs to match. Thankfully just terminated my subscription to Prime.
"I used to swear by Amazon,it was the best thing ever I am a prime member, but the last year up to today it has been the worst experiences of my life because the delivery drivers have lack of training and i started not receiving my items out of 7 days I would receive my order 1 day,a d this is continuously. They deliver to the wrong address or say they attempted delivery and then when you call you dont get much help. I wish it wasn't like this but now I am leaving Amazon. Not worth it"
"It's Amazon, 'nuf said. Been using since 2000. 24/48hr ship. Best prices and selection for anything (literally) on the web. Great customer service, easy return process. The ultimate shopping experience. Thanks Amazon! 👏🙏🤝👍"
"Now that they integrate Amazon music whenever I try to buy digital music it forces me to use a desktop to purchase digital music. Poor experience. I don't want to pay for a music subscription, I like to own what I buy."
This application used to be worth using until it simply became a self-installed advertisement. The annoyance is simply not worth the convenience. Just use Amazon's website for effectively the same experience and save yourself the notifications.
Gone downhill. The search is now awful and cumbersome. They have removed drag and drop wish lists for some reason. Also can now only view 6 months of orders. Not a good experience - app is going backwards.
"Great customer service! Love shopping from home, but love even more that on the couple of occasions I required the use of their customer service reps, it has been a good experience. They have all been friendly and extremely helpful."
"such a time saver!!! I moved from California 8 years ago, and I quickly discovered the power of saving time, fuel and money by using Amazon for my shopping. Our household has also adapted to shopping for groceries through Amazon. it's truly a 1-stop shopping experience from the comfort of the palm of your hand, no matter where you live!!!"
"Ordered something on Monday at 1pm, by 1:15 my account was suspended and my order cancelled. I haven't used Amazon in years bc it's trash and this proves it. ""Log in to complete survey"" can't log in, call customer service. ABSOLUTELY NOT. Worst experience I've ever had with ""suspicious activity"" that was truly MY ACTIVITY."
"Excellent shopping experiences. Read customers review when buying, they are very helpful. App has a lot of variety of products. Excellent choices. I love it."
The newest iteration of this app is the worst. I don't know why they buried the ability to browse by category. The main page is just useless. The whole Amazon experience has taken a nosedive the past two years.
"Good app but bad black Friday implementation, when I go to the offers page scrolling down it just starts flickering, making impossible to see what product can be handy. After a shi**y year like this, people were waiting for black Friday to buy something useful but with this user experience for somebody who is constantly checking new offers hoping that the product he needs gets a discount, this is the worst user experience that people could ever have."
"This new update is so frustrating to use. Now it just crashes. I suggest people who want to upload this app read the 1 star reviews because they sum up all of the problems with the updates to the app. I'm uninstalling it maybe I'll come back later, and see if the updates have improved. But for now I'm going to use the desktop interface"
"Latest update is trash. They keep moving the interface icons, making it difficult to track your orders. This latest update has broken links. Seriously. How do you push an update that has broken links?!"
My experience was horrible.. They locked me out of my account saying i had to send documents of a visa credit card on my account that ive never used or had after i spent money and bought coins for aps and games.. They need to get there stuff together in the credit office.
Most horrible app I've ever seen. User interface is pathetic. Currency listings are all mixed up. App is not structured in a user-friendly way. Look of the app is visually unappealing. Sad sad app
"Always had a great experience. Makes shopping at all hours comfortable . However for some reason around 3-4 am their website takes a break and probably re-boots everything, including sale items. Worth the wait."
Being able to see each item for only a second or two before an annoying video starts playing on top of it results in a horrible shopping experience. Can you please provide a way to shut that off???
Turn off the user experience testing where the search bar is at the bottom. No opt out nor option in settings is a poor decision. Also feedback through app is a pain to do.
"Great experiences with both Amazon and the app. Amazon has #1 customer service, the app is easy to use. It has an option to switch between Canada and other countries."
Worst shopping & customer care support experience with Amazon.Replacement item didn't receive last three weeks.But product status showing delivered.Pls refund the money as soon as possible.
Terrible search. Laggy. Lists won't load correctly. constantly hangs and crashes.how did amazon ever get so successful with garbage interface like this. spend some of the profits on a real app!
It's pretty good and customer service is always available to assist. Far as returns and tracking or any refunds. As that being said no complaints and no bad experiences yet.
"I recently had a disappointing experience with Amazon's customer service and product quality. I ordered a product and received less quantity than advertised. Despite raising a complaint,it was closed without any resolution. It's disheartening to suspect that Amazon may be turning a blind eye to such issues,possibly due to commission arrangements with certain sellers. As a loyal customer,I expect better transparency and accountability.I hope Amazon takes steps to address these concerns to improve"
"Recently, it had always been the worst experience dealing with Amazon. It really isn't with using them anymore unless you want rubbish that breaks and lies instead of a refund."
"Cannot search and sort which makes me use eBay more and more. eBay has a really wonderful, fuctional sort feature. HAS AMAZON ADJUSTED OUR FEES TO ACCOMMODATE THE ITEMS NOT ADHERING TO THE PRIME TERMS WE AGREED TO? Still trash app. Designed to steer to trashy sponsored products which I never buy because of that reason. App experience is now down to 1 star."
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU AMAZON??????? Not even FIVE MINUTES IN AND IT CRASHES! Not ONCE but TWICE!!!! Not using this app EVER AGAIN!! I've also had experiences with customer service where they don't DO ANYTHING TO FIX. THE. PROBLEM. I'd rather use wish than this now. it's sad how Amazon has gotten so lazy with its app and customers. disappointed.
"This app has gone from 5* to 1* it is slow, crashes, doesn't refresh orders properly. It was a fully functioning app once. Needs to be resolved ASAP. Shopping experience is being impacted."
"Clunky, Slow interface for the world's biggest online retailer. I've never had an item received correctly, undamaged, or on time, and the customer service is probably the most useless division in the company."
"I shop on Amazon all the time. The experience is easy, convenient, and the staff are very helpful if having a problem with item and need to send back to vendor. Best way to shop."
"The app went slow last time I updated. I updated again and it is now worse, and I lost all order history after 24hrs. A week later it now only shows US goods for Amazon Fresh and will not deliver to the UK... Welcome to the new meaning of ""The Amazon Experience""..."
"My experience was extremly horrible, No credit cards from sweden are accepted which made it impossible to order anything at all. Uninstalled the app and will not install for the upcoming 2 years."
"Amazon is always a seamless experience. There's never any problems with my orders and tgey show up on time. Amazon has the best customer service as an online shopping retailer. Returns are always easy, No hassles"
Amazon getting horrible every day. When I connect amazon prime it absolutely doesn't work shipment goes same as whithout prime. They just send massages ' I'm sorry your order late' or receive empty package they say ' I'm sorry for bad experience' . All this things can be ok if you getting better but they getting worse
Get rid of Rufus. I do not want AI in my shopping experience.
"""I have been a long-time customer of Amazon and they used to be very helpful to me. However, after speaking with their customer service department yesterday, I had a hard time understanding what they were trying to say. This experience has made me reconsider whether I should continue to purchase from them."""
Always a terrible experience. Nothing ever shows up on time. Packages are sent to random houses and I'm sent a picture of some random doorstep with my package sitting on it. Theres a million better services out there. Don't limit yourself to this one.
"My experience with Amazon it very good, I never loose any packages and I always received the right order I placed on this website."
Terrible returns experience. Amazon invests heavily on delivering products but makes it difficult to return items or get help with convoluted system from customer service. Makes buying products a stressful headache.
"Disgusting company, failed to deliver orders on time, changing dates without permission, holding money and not giving back refunds for days. Horrible experience, don't recommend using it. OZON is way much better."
"Suddenly very unstable, difficult to navigate, pages not loading properly, was always reliable for years until past month, now experience can be irritating and inconvenient."
"Very angry with my experience!!,I have an order that's now late. The delivery date has been changed twice, seller ignores my emails and I've emailed them twice spent $50. It's a Christmas gift ordered it in November."
"My shopping experience with Amazon is amazing, up until someone has stolen my identity and now Amazon has frozen my account. I have spoken with a customer service agent to try and resolve this issue. I'm waiting for someone to email me back or call, I've been waiting for a week now, and I really need a foot stool for my kitchen. I tried to order one from Amazon but my account is still frozen. Please respond to my problem. Thank you. 👍"
worst customer service upon delayed delivery even with prime membership. my delivery was late and when i called the customer service they were not able to help me. wasted my 1 hour keep me transferring call from customer support to shipment agents and it happened 6 time. ultumately after scolding got an answer that my shipment will be delivered on new time only. been through hell for 1 hour telling each support person about what is my issue. Lovely experience! i am going to close my account
"Amazon is overrated and overpriced. I haven't had a good experience with them. If your package doesn't show and ask them to investigate it for a refund or replacement, good luck! Every time I try to talk to anyone its someone who doesn't speak English very well. This place only caters to the rich man unfortunately."
I love Amazon. I mainly use my Kindle app to read and for my everyday shopping but I love how I can preorder my books and they alert me as soon as it's available. This is my most favorite app beside my Kindle app. it's easy to use and it literally has everything and having prime makes my whole experience so much more.
They moved your orders down to the bottom so you have to search for them to figure out what's showing up what day. The new interface looks cool but is useless for most
"Don't know who is doing Customer Experience Testing for this APP. Previously I can easily see Today's Deal etc. Via home screen. Now I have to go different option to reach out to Deals. Only thing this update did good, I stopped buying too much as can't see the deal on first screen😀 only buying which is absolutely necessary"
The absolute worst app experience I have ever had. Lost customer for life! Would rather walk 100 miles to a store then use this service. Unable to sign in after many many attempts. Please remove ALL of my information from your database. Do not waste your time with a response.
Is the worst experience that I had ever I would like to buy a laptop but since I was late and sleepy I entered my credit card number incorrectly I had to get back and correct my error According to Amazon my credit card that I have for 20 years and I use it all the time is mine. So they canceled my order and asked me to submit my credit card statement so they could confirm. My address And my name witch I did but According to them the credit card wasn't mine. Incredible.
"Would never use again. Overpriced items, would not let me write a review. Expensive products that does not match description. Absolutely disgusted with the experience. Ebay is much better. I would stick to ebay forever. You must $50 or over to write a feedback. Ridiculous company. Never never again"
"This app update is horrible, all I see is adds music artist I'm not interested in car ads tv shows. No recommendations to the searches I do. Shopping experience horrible."
"So far I've had a pleasant experience with Amazon Prime.. I'm wheelchair bound and shopping at home is a little more convenient at times. There's only been a few issues here and there and overall I'm pleased with the 2 day delivery, etc! Thank you! Ms.. Lori K."
"It is the place to go for a great shopping experience, and deals that are priced wihtin your budget. The app makes navigating quite easy."
ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLY HORRIBLE!!! I WOULDN'T EVEN GIVE THEM 1 STAR AFTER MY EXPERIENCE TRYING TO USE AN AMAZON GIFT CARD!! I received a $50 Amazon gift card for Christmas the first time I purchase something was around $30 and I had an $18 balance. When trying to use the balance of the gift card it would not go through because I did not have a credit card to register into their account. So now I have an $18 credit with Amazon that I will probably never use because I can't register a credit card
"Becoming increasingly frustrated with Amazon's interface, and the fraudulent/counterfeit products. It makes finding what you want a bit tedious."
"Always done me right, even when I was wrong. Best customer service I have ever experienced. Can't say enough good things about how helpful the customer service reps. are. From start to finish my average call time is under 5 min.. I cant get other companies to even get me to a live person in under 20 min."
Had to sadly delete app today because it was freezing up my phone screen of late. Amazon Prime app was once a pleasurable online experience...not so now! I'll reinstall the app again when the bug issues are resolved.
I have used Amazon about a half dozen times over the past few years. Not once have I had a good experience... never. I have been waiting about 2 weeks for a tent that I purchased. It is late and I just found out that delivery was redirected and now I have to drive 20 miles to pick it up. There are Amazon trucks all over my neighborhood 7 days a week. These tend to ignore basic driving laws and are butt ugly. They congest local traffic by using double parking as the norm. Prices not good.
"what can I say? I've always had a great shopping experience. when ever I've had issues with products, Amazon's customer service is top notch and prompt! everything is easy and I have no complaints!"
Really don't like the new bottom menu bar/interface tweaks that make it harder to browse. Do you want people to look at the lightning deals? If not Great Job!
"Only downside which affecting my experience is that you can't go forward after even once you have gone backward. You have to re-search, find etc. to go that page again. It is annoying."
"Recent Update Ruined App. Ever since the recent update, I have experienced the app freezing over and over again. I seem to only be able to browse for about a minute before the app freezing and my phone asking if I want to close or wait for the app. How are we supposed to purchase anything?"
"Very poor interface design, text in the buttons is not visible, the old souq design was much more active and eye friendly. The design is so basic and poor. Please develop it."
"Unusable right now. You have a wide collection of cute dogs, but repeatedly seeing that ""something is wrong on our end"" every 10 seconds does not lead to a conducive shopping experience."
Better experience than using a mobile website. A couple tiny tweaks (like swiping away the added item to cart instead of pressing the x) would be nice.
I have being using this app for years and never had a bad experience. It have being a useful way of shopping for me. Thank you all for the experience. My only wish is that that app will support dark mode for the next update. Because I only use my phone on dark mode. So it's only viable that this app support it.
"tbh amazon was good,but lately the experiences ive been having havent been worth the trouble,ive been a prime member for two years and all of a sudden my packages come almost five days late with 2 day shipping and the last two orders where werent even delivered at all and even if they were they wouldve been four days late,no point in using it for the holidays people just wait till next year cause they cant keep up🤷‍♂️"
"I cannot speak to the practices of this company but as a consumer I am overwhelmed by the quality assurance, vast catalog of ""hard to finds"", and excellent customer support! I'm not entirely sure what goes on behind the curtain but I have had an excellent experience with this app and company!!!"
"Amazon won't allow an honest review. I find it very strange that since there's so much in the news about reviews on Amazon being false, that they decline honest reviews to be published. I've been an Amazon shopper for years and when I give a review that's honest and based on my experience with the items, if it's a bad review, they won't let it be seen by consumers and I also get an email stating that my review didn't qualify. If I bought an item, and used it, it qualifies. Period."
I'm tired of this app being a glorified wrapper of the mobile website. There's a lot you can miss using this app versus the mobile and desktop experiences that it's insane this still exists in some form.
"Generally, apps feel different than websites, but this one does not. So, the interface might not be for everyone.. Also, why can I not change my language to whatever I want? Language restrictions for countries seem very unnecessary. ."
So many fakes you can even get Amazon's own products but fake versions of their website unreal I've had so many products described as one thing as come as another the only thing they're interested in this making money not customer experience or quality and less and less products are available for next-day delivery go elsewhere you'll be better off
"Dealing with Amazon Egypt is one of the worst experiences ever I purchased a product, and it didn't match what I ordered, and when I made a request to return it, the account was closed without giving any reasons I contacted customer service by phone more than once, and I didn't even know the reason for closing my account, and the problem wasn't resolved, and the product that didn't match wasn't returned. Now I have a product that I don't want and my account is closed too and I have no idea why!!"
Pretty much has everything I need and sometimes don't need right at the click of a button! Speedy delivery and respectful of property! Also no fuss return at Kohls! My experience has always been positive!
"This app has become the unstable piece of garbage around. 9 out of 10 times I click on something I get the stupid dog ""uh oh, something went wrong"" page. Cute puppies DONT make your inability to provide a reasonably functional app better! Jerks...Ive been shopping on Ebay this year because the Amazon customer experience has just become trash"
"The new interface is not good. They've made it more difficult to navigate. I guess I shouldn't be surprised, I mean Prime Video UI is awful also."
"amazon list tray is annoying! everytime I add something to my list, it pops up and I have to manually hide it again. this really ruins the experience of shopping."
"terrible app transitioning, all the helpful search filters are gone, it's interface way too poor compared to souq, i normally shop to souq if no available time because of work but now it seems that i need to stop by to a mall or something just to shop"
"Very good, customer service was excellent thank you my 1st experience with Amazon was wonderful no problems, only the inexsperience that I have but Amazon fixed and straighten out my order and got it I returned the extra orders and they refund my account no problems I 💕 yall Amazon C.Harris Antioch,Ca"
"Bad experience and products are always damaged, bad quality, missing parts, not working properly and bad quality The app is not good at all it takes time to load it's not easy to find an option it's a complete miss and unexpected"
"A significant difficulty in using Amazon is that they have so little respect for their customers that they have no genuine concerns about problems experienced by them, so make it almost impossible for them to contact support, other than by messaging racially exploited people in third world countries who struggle with the English language. The only other way is via a list of common questions and answers, but nothing is ever so straightforward; however, it serves Amazon's indifference."
Terrible experience. I ordered on this app and it said the package had arrived I haven't gotten it so I contacted customer service they told me I would be able to get a refund or to have another one sent in. I am furious with them and I won't be using this app ever again. Back to the wish app
My experience with this service has been great but this weird bug where the app forcefully keeps closing itself whenever I am trying to use it is annoying and frustrating.
"Horrible app, if your order doesn't arrive. you have not options to get your many back, and when you try to make a complaint to your contact seller, they give you the same answer every time. Horrible horrible experience. I have been paying almost 5 months the membership for nothing. They are bad people. I am giving them 1 star cause it is the only option you have for making a review. 😡🤬😠"
"Very horrible experience, bought stuffs twice, and on both occasions my order was put in process for no reason, customer service was unable to help me to process the payment. Very disappointing."
seriously? No more continuous scrolling. now I have to click next every few items to keep seeing more... why? so you can have more ads for things I'm not currently actively looking for... great shopping experience...
"Amazon is generally ok but Ive had a bad experience & have gotten nowhere with a seller & Amazons customer service. I bought a refurbished phone it had issues, I contacted seller, then I had to pay to ship it back to the seller before the 90 day warrenty ended. After 2 months I havnt received a replacement so I contacted Amazon & twice I was told it would be credited to a gift card. I still havn't recieved it. At this point I'm out $190 & Im not happy. Amazon's A-Z Guarantee was not honored here"
"Great one stop shopping and intuitive interface. Simple to navigate, yet flexible enough to almost replace desktop shopping."
"HATE THE SEARCH BAR ON THE BOTTOM. All of the latest updates (wish list layout, search bar, etc) make the app less user friendly and casual shopping a frustrating experience. Change it back."
Amazon is sooo bad. I downloaded this app 4 days ago. Someone hacked it. I called customer service and she couldn't even tell me what was my balance. AMAZON IS BAD FOR BUISNESS. I PUT A REVIEW ON FACEBOOK BECAUSE YOU GUYS ARE RIDICULOUS AND VERY NON PROFESSIONAL. I WILL HAVE MY DAUGHTER CANCEL HER ACCOUNT AS WELL! Y'ALL NEED TO DO BETTER. MY EXPERIENCE WAS LIKE MEETING WITH THE DEVIL. TERRIBLE
"My shopping experience has been pretty good. Everything arrives on time, I get what I expect, prices are low, and usually with discounts. Due to school and work, I don't get to go shopping to physical stores, so Amazon always has what I need. <3"
"I should have posted this sooner. Ever since Amazon separated the eBook purchase from the shopping experience, it has proved problematic and will not let me share my partner's Prime account nor open the Kindle app under my name. I need a fix asap!!"
"For the most part it's a good enough shopping experience, but they have fraudulently made charges to my credit card twice in the past so I really can't trust it the way I should be able to. Use Amazon at your own risk."
"New update is bad for user experience. Listings have been changed so it no longer shows the number of reviews unless you click on it. In addition, the star rating has changed to just show the number rather than a visual 5-star rating, making it more cumbersome to compare ratings. This is a big deal for me so I will probably be using the website from now on."
They will steal your money if you save your cards to the app. I've had several experiences like this so I'm done. Forget prime. Amazon is awful for our actual mailing system anyways
"Back in th day, whn I was a youn'gn & th Mall was th experience, bottom line; shopping 2 feeling better Is fortunately or unfortunately th All-American experience. Amazon shopping makes it a quicker uptake 2 be USA, feel good easy accessibility of good endorphins fo us working stiffs. Who often & lately need that upshot of feel-good n these diminished days for good news, or good anything abound. That Amazon pkg in th mail always fulfills, over the d a rk."
"As everyone knows their website is well priced, easy to navigate, vast selection, quick delivery, and a consistent experience almost everytime!"
"The delivery guarantee is worthless. After a late delivery (expedited shipping) and a labrynthine customer service experience, there was no way for anyone at any level to honour the guarantee. No explanation, just stonewalling. Terrible experience from a company that prides itself on convenient shipping and customer service 👎👎👎"
I've found Amazon to have customers first in mind. We've enjoyed great sevice and selection as we journey through our experiences. Yes I'm pleased very much so.
Product pages are cluttered with options and buttons are occasionally unresponsive. Experience is usually fine.
"Overall a good experience. However, I do not like the new updated app as well as the older version. They are a few issues with it working, but still using it."
The latest version forces me to watch a commercial upon opening?? I couldn't possibly dislike this more. I pay for prime and just want to shop for something. I don't want to have to watch your promo for some movie you are promoting first. Horrible mobile experience!!
"The worst experience i ever had with a shopping app, the delivery is always late, the costumer service is poor and always trying to excuse their lack quality dervice with a couple of dhs . I wouldn't recommend this service at all"
"App works great but drivers are questionalable. They left my package in the parking lot of my apartments and noted delivered to my back porch. Wich I dont have. My order was $149.00, Im not Jeff Bezos ok so thats alot of money to me to be left sitting in a parking lot. WILL NOT USE AGAIN. Thank you Amazon for a bad experience."
Last 2 updates have half broken what didn't need fixed. Additional colors/options will cause it to hang and ruin the shopping experience. Terrible.
"Its such a good experience with Amazon shopping regardless wich country i do my shopping. Iv been a long time customer of amazon not a single problem came to me. All items arrive quickly, all were bought in a really good price and specially the courier here in saudi arabia were excellent. Keep up the good work.."
The UI is awful and the experience of finding things horrendous. I believe Amazon are able to make a great app but choose not to.
The latest update to the app is incredibly slow and grinds to a halt constantly. A very frustrating experience.
"Worst experience ever, sellers will cancel your orders when items get more expensive, sellers will sell you damaged products and last but not least sellers will sell you products refusing to give you an invoice and the worst here is that amazon will do nothing but telling you we will check, seller is even refusing to reply on their messages yet he's still able to sell on the platform.They're protecting perfectly the sellers with 0 protection for the buyers.Purchased last year 80K AED now stopped"
"When searching for a product, app selects the wrong item. Has a very poor search interface, for an enormous company they sure don't invest much in customer service."
"Cannot figure out for the life of me, why they changed their icons to such huge pictures of products where it doesn't even fit my screen. Their interface sucks and as a result I don't feel like buying from them anymore. 😵"
"Amazon custom gift list experience is horrible if you are getting multiple of the same item, don't know everyone who is buying you did. Terrible for the humanitarian relief collection work we used them for; wasted hours on the phone with customer service. Do not recommend!"
"So...I meant this one star rating to be for Amazon... I bought an iPad from Amazon that came defective, trying to return the iPad was such a painful experience.. after like 30 minutes of back and forth, I was told that the replacement would take 3 weeks to get shipped...."
Much slower and wish list is no longer at the bottom where you can easily drag a product pic to it. Overall a much worse experience than the previous version.
Very disappointed! I had a good experience till last time when i ordered a Camera and SD card. They locked my acount after i make the order and i was not able to cancel it. So i write to customer service e-mail (3 times) and nobody answer... Now I received my SD card and they took my money but about the Camera they still waiting and my acount still frozen...
Shopping with Amazon is great and really easy. Packages are shipped right on time.. It's just an overall great experience.
Always a great experience. You can get just about anything. You just have to know your pricing on certain items to ensure it's worth the higher price sometimes of it being delivered to your door or mailbox.
"Worst support and service. When claimed for promised Warranty, I was shocked by Irresponsible Response from a company like Amazon. I have been buying from Amazon for last 3 years. but when there was an issue with my purchased product and claimed my warranty, i had an extremely bad experience from Amazon and their support team. Never again from Amazon india."
"On my very first order i had negative experience due to packaging and delivery issue. I rather buy from companies who are hungry for customers. Amazon does not genuinely cares about its customer. One thing always should be remembered companies starts from zero, they grow and one they can be erased and forgotten. Every each customer is important and do your job as you advertise and claim. ZERO STAR to Amazon."
"I have never had one single issue with the service you all provide, now the items I bought that is another story! But your customer service department even took care of that. All i can say is I experienced excellent service."
The experience I've had on Amazon has been amazing. The products I've bought have all been great and the qaulity has been far better than expected.
The new interface is so horrible. Has add to cart button that for the past 20 minutes hasn't worked on anything I want. I am going to Walmart this sucks!!!
Slow unresponsive app. If Amazon would put as much effort into their app running as they did posting political nonsense down everyones throat it'd be a lot better experience. I don't care about your politics Bezos. I just want to be able to purchase goods.
"Invades your privacy. You can buy a gift card but you're not allowed to use it unless you have a credit card to ""authenticate"" you. How am I not allowed to spend the money I earned? I can't return it, how is this fair. Also you get your account disabled if you buy something with gift card and have no credit card. Worst shopping experience ever, I've had my Amazon account for years and only today I realize how horrible customers are treated."
"App is very slow and unresponsive, especially when clicking on multi-values combo boxes within product page. Completely ruining shopping experience."
Faultless service and ease of use. App makes is very intuitive and works well with a large range of products. Makes on-line shopping an easy experience.
The interface is bad. The old Souq app interface was simpler and wasn't messy. They're a lot of mistakes happen with orders. A lot of untrused sellers sell their fake products there. This app is a joke compared to old souq app.
Worst ever experience with Amazon.I placed an order and paid through my bank card.Just after some time of placing order i received an sms that my account has gone on hold (without explanation) and later they deleted my account. I was not provided any order number and when i contact customer service several time they are asking for order number. I have only order conformation screenshot and sms received by Amazon. I sent them more then 15 emails wasted my precious time but no solution
The latest update completely changed the whole app and shopping experience with Amazon. I will cancel my prime membership if it is not fixed or changed. Shame on you amazon app people!! SHAME ON YOU!
"As much as I hate to admit it I do love Amazon shopping -- every once in a while an update to this app breaks down, but for the most part it works well and the interface is (relatively) user-friendly."
"I wish it will be better if there is an option to retake the cancel order.i had an experience last day, i was waiting for a toy for my son since 1 week, unfortunately few hours before delivery by mistakenly i press the cancel order. Very next moment i got message that the delivery is going back to amozon, i tried so much to get that order because if i place a new order for the same toy it will take another 1 week. But i got the reply from customer care,there is no option to retake the cancel"
Please... PLEASE program a direct to garage interface. This thing where you only SOMETIMES get (asked to) filter part(s) results for a specific vehicle is driving me crazy.
"My experience with the app was easy ""at first"", but the app keeps on not working and also stuff that say EBT eligible cannot be bought, when you go to the check out, it says not EBT eligible and you need to update your payment, when clearly the items say ""EBT ELIGIBLE!"""
"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EEEEEVER EXPERIENCED !!LITERALLY any time I call ""Canada Customer support"" it brings me over sea's.......all i wanna do is speak with the local amazon about a delivery..apparently thats not possible..lol absolutely ridiculous & appalling......DO NOT bother with amazon......amazon prime is also a rip off....you subscribe to PRIME...but than you still have to buy/rent & subscribe to other things.......AMAZON is nothing but a bunch of thieves !!!!!"
I have got a SIMs card from the Q Link service through Amazon and it is a invalid SIMs card that does not work and I've tried working on it for a week now so I'm very disappointed in this because that's the first thing that I've ever got from them that was faulty advertising I had a very bad experience with it
ordered a non fiction book called im glad my mom died and Amazon delivered the gingerbread man book to me???!! am so disappointed w the mix up and to make things worse refund process takes some time so definitely a terrible first experience w Amazon edit: applied for a refund and followed the return label and instructions but it's been over a month n still no news??! so disappointed
Horrible experience...ordered a parcel and it never showed up on the expected delivery day...When I contacted AMAZON they told me it was lost in transit...Dnt understand how they keep losing all of the parcels cause this now the 3rd time that I have ordered something and it doesn't show up
Always on amazon. I'm always on amazon. They always have something I need or want. A to Z. Is spot on. I never had a bad experience with amazon and when there was a problem they helped me sort it out. App never lags. And it doesn't harass me about alexa.....don't know if it's cause I already have her enabled or what.
Absolutely terrible experience lately! The holidays are rapidly approaching. Please fix the continuous app unresponsive issues using Samsung Galaxy 51.
"Removal of any support for tablet devices is illogical. Amazon, you sell your own (andriod based) tablets???? Why can't I use an app to shop Amazon with my tablet anymore? I won't be switching to an inferior browser interface or ordering anything further from Amazon until this is fixed."
I order one baby toy for my 3 year child. Today morning I got mail that my order will be delivered today. I told to my daughter and she is very happy. But afternoon I got another mail that my order cancelled because they can't deliver reason not mentioned. You people can't my feelings because my daughter is waiting for that. Its my mistake I should order it in flipkart atleast they will ask me to collect it from there office. Its a bad experience from Amazon. And this is not the first time
"I've had really bad experience's, but always was resolved quickly. Customer service is always very professionally, friendly, and knowledgeable."
"I enjoy the variety of products and great prices I find on Amazon. In addition, it's always easy to find what I want, and the purchasing experience is great."
very bad experience. calling to customer care regarding my orders but haven't yet got any positive response. i ordered 4 items 2 of them marked as delivered 8 days ago but haven't reached my home. i don't know where they delivered. waste of time and money
Prime no longer means 2 day shipping. What used to be 2 day Prime shipping is now 4-5 days standard. Why am I paying for Prime at all? Experience continues to get worse. Wish I could give it zero stars. I have since cancelled my Prime subscription.
Bad interface. Not user friendly. Difficult to deal with returns/replacements. Amazon does not care about you as a consumer. This review is a waste of time as Amazon does NOT care. Google will likely delete anyway just like they did with Robinhood.
"This is very bad experience in my life, I'm from India and and amazon have very good service there, but here I don't know, what happened with amazon, they don't have any knowledge about to how give proper service or I think they are not serious, they first take too time to deliver and saying sorry for delay, end of the moment they cancelled my order by themselves and blaming you canceled your order, omg, I think they are smart?? It's good for them but I can't order from here anymore, they have v"
"Installed this thing because of a promo they said would give you $10 voucher for installing it, right on the Amazon site. Nothing came of it, and it's a worse experience to use than just visiting the site on mobile."
"i will NEVER use the locker pickup option again! This has been, by far, the worst experience I've had with Amazon in an extremely long time. It takes up to 6 hours to get the code to use at the locker. On top of that, I called to see if i could possibly get the code sooner and was told that even though I received confirmation that my order was delivered, it wasn't delivered yet because it wasn't in the locker. What kind of sense does that make???? NONE! 😠😠"
When you click an item from a search result page on this app there is no way to go back to your search results page making this a very frustrating shopping experience. It didn't used to be this way. Please fix.
"The worst shopping website I have ever experienced. Refund takes too long more than expected days as it is written. I got a wrong product. Please don't get involved, this app is fraudulent!!!!! FLIPKART IS THE BEST, GO AND SHOP ON FLIPKART!!!!!!!!!!!"
"So far the best online shopping experience to date, app is easy to use, user friendly and quick. Just some minor upgrades for ease of use, customer service is quick and responsive, overall happy with the Amazon app and it gets 10 stars for me but Google play only allows 5 😁"
"Horrible experience. First I log into my account to purchase some parts to build a gaming pc and when I do it tells me there's ""suspicious activity"" on my account so I can't log back in unless I do some tedious verifaction form. So que the next day and I get a notification from my phone that a purchase of 198 dollars was made on amazon somewhere in washington, seattle. Just deactivated my card and am now waiting for them (bank) to review the dispute I filed."
I absolutely love Amazon! Amazon has changed my whole shipping experience for life. Highly recommend to anyone who hasn't made an account yet! Prime is so worth it. Yes you pay monthly but if you're like me it's well worth the free shipping from all the product you buy.
"Really disappointed with the coding. Shopping itself is a fairy good experience,but navigating in this app is horrendous. Trying to contact or answer seller is like trying to find a way through a maze, and when you get there you can't even type because somehow it hasn't registered in the proper category, so I can only see the question but have to wait ages so I can answer. What a let down, so much money wasted, I feel bad for normal Amazon employees deing with incompetent superiors"
very good experience easy to use 👍🏽
"This is my first time to use this app,I've experienced a very long and over due delivery here in the Philippines I've bought an item last May 30 it suppose to be arriving here last July 12 but didn't make it , so they give another 7days to receive , i don't know if it were truly arrived . I'll never order again in this ridiculous app"
"Have been happy and very satisfied with all of my Amazon experiences. I would appreciate if deliveries would either knock or ring the bell. Someone's always here and to avoid porch Pirates I would appreciate knowing there's something on the porch, so please ring or knock. Thank you for the courtesy, you guys are great!!"
"App update changes not good. Dont like not being able to have continuous scroll vs next page tab. Also lost drag and drop shopping list feature. Fix app update, makes shopping experience horrible!!!"
"The first purchase experience from Amazon UAE was unsuccessful. When purchasing and paying the amount, my shipment was sent to another country, although my address and phone number are very clear. In the end, they promised to return the amount to my card, and I decided not to buy from Amazon UAE"
App keeps crashing. I scroll maybe 4 to 5 items and cant go farther. Started yesterday. Please fix this. Love amazon and havent had this bad experience before. Ill update my reveiw when its fixed
"Amazon UAE is a total mess. Very very bad experience. Too much lies...After writing this review, I will uninstall the app. How can you place an order and pay priority delivery....one week on from purchase product is no where to be found. Giving me ridiculous excuses."
"First of all, why did you change the app icon? Might be preference but I get confused with this one. Second, why change the interface? The original one was much easier to manage."
"You would think one of the wealthiest companies on the planet would make it easy to connect with customer service, but their customer service experience is worse than companies 1/20 it's market cap. They make it convoluted and annoying to even access an area where you can chat with someone"
"I'm not sure why but the app has kicked me out of 2 accounts second one being made because it kicked me out of the first one, and it tells me to reset my password and I do everything to do so and it doesn't let me reset it this exact same thing has also happened to my girlfriend, not sure why you say you see ""suspicious activity"" on my account, and instead of emailing me to ask if it's me, it just kicks me out and doesn't allow me back in, not a really good experience."
"great experience great book price 58 euro, expensive post charges 54 euro . 1 book at great price , postage equal price ."
"Wanted to purchase Christmas gifts but instead I keep getting images of very sad and creepy dogs saying Ops! when trying to open my cart. Has been 2 days now and as a prime member is a big big no no. The biggest and richest company on earth should focus more on their app and website that are their biggest asset and the only shopping window to their world. Very disappointed, ugly and lagging the interface (web and mobile) was a distaster ready to happen as it did for me on the most frenzy time."
"Started using this in covid, its great. £8 a month gives you free postage, plus music, films etc. Plus a lot of parcels come with 48 hours, never had a bad experience with drivers or parcels not getting delivered. Products are mainly great quality, if returned you get your money back normally within 24 hours. It's great."
"I am completely unsatisfied by recent experience with deliveries, at the end of the day I get an email from amazon saying that the delivery driver couldn't deliver and they did not want to leave the item unattended!!!! I get confused every time I get the email because I am sat here waiting for the parcel and NO-ONE has knocked. I have a notice on door requesting a loud knock because of hearing, my lights are on all day, TV may be on so unless driver is is also hard of hearing AND blind it is del"
"I've had my account locked twice because of a new debit card. WHICH HAS MY NAME ON IT. And I made a new account for that reason and ONCE AGAIN it was locked for no reason at all. The debit card has MY name on it. Also, shopping experience on here sucks."
"The browsing / scrolling experience is broken on Pixel 6 Android 12. Scrolling down doesn't work effectively, meaning it's not smooth nor does it actually scroll down. This is in product section, payment, ordering, etc..."
so bad....my order has been delivered in wrong person and they dont provide contact info on their center so we could follow up ny order...hell no! i havent received my package yet base on tracking information it was delivered already and received by someone i never know...how could i fix this..my gaddd...this is the worst online shopping i ever experienced
"Amazon experience is disappointing: Item does not arrive USPS, go to the APP and it says I may request a refund. I click refund, and one minute later an email arrives informing me that I can NOT request a refund directly, I have to contact customer service. Why doesn't Amazon tell me to do this in the first place? Dumb and Dumber."
"I Love Amazon! Just experience long waits for items, Understandably during this Corona Virus restrictions & massive amounts of people , like me, causing delays. I would like to say Thank You to the Staff working through this, and helping us. Stay Safe & Healthy Sincerely, Suzanne 😊😇"
I feel now I couldn't do without amazon. You get help if anything issue been raise. And I just can't stop shopping here. Such great experience thank you amazon for being best selling site. At least they give u date znd you can track on the day .I tried others but I had to say nothing compares.
"I always have had great shopping experiences from Amazon ! Packages arrive on time .. Been very satisfied with my orders over the years ... I have no bad issues to complain about ... Except now trying to write five hundred words to say thank you .....I love Amazon Prime !!!! All my packages have pretty much been on time ..... For which I'm grateful ..... It's very stressful when you're expecting a package , especially if it's a gift for someone .... But , so far I'm satisfied with Amazon , ty !"
Guys today I got a worst experience from this app. I can't believe that a reputed company like Amazon can do such inappropriate things. I ordered earbuds from this app and it showed me that I will get my parcel by 19 of April. It came on last Saturday gave the parcel and took it back saying that the barcode is not been scanned and never came back. I call the CSE to check what's going on but no updates. They told me that you will get your parcel by Monday morning but the delivery guy didn't came
I have always had stellar experiences with the app and company. I recently had a issue with a seller on the app named ebuymartusa giving me the incorrect tracking # on a package but after communicating with them they responded with the correct number and an apology. I hope to conduct business with them and amazon again.
The best service in the region. Excellent shopping experience with a lot of options. I'm a prime subscriber ever since they introduced the fast delivery feature among other good benifits that came with it. Thank you for providing us with such an excellent compititve service.
Not a fan of new interface. Seems slower and less intuitive. Maybe it's just me but previous layout was perfectly fine.
Most of my experiences with anything not sold by Amazon have been fairly well. A few bumps but nothing major til I tried to pre order something they were selling. A ty lee funky set to come out July 14 and be delivered the 17th...never got it and now they want more than previously put up....and best they can do is make me pay out of pocket. NEVER ORDER FROM AMAZON DIRECTLY ALWAYS GO THIRD PARTY
Always have had a pleasant experience shopping on Amazon. I've used it for years and it's been effortless and pleasurable each time. Costumer service aims to please.
"Terrible interface on Android. When typing in chat, the keyboard covers up the text line. Notifications don't take you to a relevant screen. Comically bad from such a large, well-known, and wealthy company"
"Its a god awful app and the overall amazon experience is absolute garbage so here my situation amazon is a garbage middle man its shipping is long, its more expensive than just buying from the manufacturer, and the quality of the product on arrival is abysmal so in conclusion amazon is a god awful compasny who ups its price,delivers horrible services, and the long delivery is always delayed. So screw this garbage app and company I suggest shopping at Ebay or anywhere else other than this app."
"Some Products are good but Delivery service is not good. I have many times ordered more than 1 item at the same time and at the same location.But after placing 1-2 orders, they bother every morning by calling. What is your location. Dubai which place? which area? etc.I don't know what problem they have every time.i had a bad experience."
My every experience has been terrific. Amazon has made my life so much easier. Fast shipping and unlimited product choices. I'm hooked.
"What I've been able to put together is this app out performed most all others combined, retail-online shopping-shipping, they have the market cornered and that's just the way it should be since they are the people who started multiple apps put into one online experience to get everything done needed, for kids , teens and adults likewise Amazon will have what you need and get it to u like no other!"
"I have absolutely loved the amazon experience as a whole. The delivery is always speedy, I have found every item I have looked for and everything has arrived in perfect condition. I'm a big fan 🤘"
"Delivers what it promises, some items are vet poorly made but haven't had an issue big enough to really complain. All the products are pretty cool. Hit and miss but the prices are always reasonable.a few trash items but I have more good experiences than bad. So, nothing major to complain about."
"Search filters come and go, zoomed pictures rarely load 1st - 3rd tries, get notifications either way too early or too late. As all amazon apps, user interface is absolute rubbish"
"Not a shopping experience I have found enjoyable...I'll stick to supporting my local businesses, prices aren't that much different for new objects anyway...I don't buy second hand from online, only in person, so I can be sure I'm getting what I'm paying for."
"Not even a three star hello to reviews. Amazon, as in a company, should consider making their refunds more transparent. My experience shown me I will be leaving this company for better customer support. Not to say the lovely person on the other side of the phone line wasn't friendly. No. When leaving the conversation, the automated how your service was not the service I was looking for, therefor, Amazon company needs to adapt a policy of fairness and inclusion to get hard workers .....just sayin"
"Great logic design, provides convenient shopping interface but response time is terrible! I could walk to the store in the time this app consumes in latency alone."
"Latest update makes the app very clunky and hides some functionality. Not a very user friendly experience, using the website instead."
Amazon has shown me that no other app come close to it. Never had such a wonderful experience before in my entire life. Americans and others who have easy access to items sold on Amazon are truly lucky.
"Love amazon, and the old app was great, May 2021 update has completely changed the UI and shopping experience, making it harder to use and harder to just browse categories."
The update is absolutely horrible. No longer easy to use! Very horrible experience. No longer shows all items on same page.
"my only complaint is how awesome the shopping experience is with Amazon, I spend way too much. they really get what a seamless experience for their customers means."
"Worst interface to read product reviews. No way to list them one by one, no way to list reviews w fotos one by one, no way to see full title in a review if it is long text."
"5 Stars to Amazon!!!! Great shopping/ordering experience every time with very punctual delivery times, competitive prices and no hassle returns!!! Thanks to the entire Amazon team!!!!!!!"
it's amazon. it's the most convenient and streamlined shopping experience in the world. other websites or apps just can't compare. THANK YOU UNCLE JEFF
The one reliable shopping experience. Not only during the purchase even after long time of using an item amazon supports the customers on hand. Trust worthy
Samsung A20 works perfectly! Everything conveniently placed in this app! The interface is very easy to view and use! Definitely recommend!
"It's so annoying when you use a MasterCard. Honestly, this was the first time I ever ordered something that was an actual object online and the payment experience wasn't that great 🙃"
"by far the worst shop i ever visited online....i made an order about an item, a voucher gift card that was supposed to be sent to my gmail and it never came through...i only got the order number...not the code of the card that was supposed to come to me...i tried seeking help in your support system ...nothing.absolute ignorance ...failures this experience was based on amazon.co.uk not from the app.but mine and others frustrations couldnt stayy put and say nothing.amazon.co.uk basically stole 20£"
I have great experiences shopping on line Amazon's way. Everything is easy and priced just right. I do take advantage of Amazon prime free shipping.
Update: 1. Why show me the items not deliverable to my location? 2. Product images not loading inside dedicated image view (i.e. clicking on image in product page). Taking back one star for that experience. Still the only platform that listens to customers and takes action.
Temu dot com. You'll be much happier with a much more user-friendly experience and you will save loads of money and the real kicker is that the shipping doesn't take much longer than Amazon.
I will only buy things and stuff from Amazon the service is very much appreciated and fast. I don't like ebay or wish I could buy from Amazon all the time my experience is a awesome way to shop online. I have no doubt that Amazon will keep me happy.
"Love the return policy. if it is not what they showed, I send it back. I had a bad experience buying from a Facebook post. Amazon Prime is safe, in my opinion."
Great experience with this app is very useful in all meanings.
"Shopped on Amazon for the last 15 years, encountered a very disappointing experience buying a chainsaw a few days ago, Getting ready to close this account for good."
Mostly good experiences here but unable to rate items due to the fact I buy everything with gift cards. A few late deliveries but mostly on time or early. Delivery through the US Postal Service is the biggest pain in the ass.
"I have been using since 2 years, and it works just fine for me.. Yes some experiences like finding some tabs becomes difficult at times.. but overall in satisfied with this app"
This was my first and last experience with this aap. It's totally crazy aap lazy service and very slow pickup procedure. Delive wrong item . And take weeks for return and refund. I tired so much with it. At last I cancle the return item and used it .
"The worst online shopping experience, they sent me wrong items, and the customer service were awful.. all of them, all of them are very rude and very unhelpful. My advice to the people is not to buy from amazon."
Always a good experience when using amazon prime account. Works really well when my daughter was small and we needed the subscribe and save for diapers and pull ups too.
I don't enjoy the new layout of this app. The interface is too confusing. I feel like the layout of the previous version of this app was great. I feel like it was updated in the name of progress.
I like the Amazon but I didn't like the interface that interface I feel like old delivery timing is good product was sometimes wrong shipping one time I ordered the SD card adapter and delivery product is led lamp😠😠
What a pathetic mess! This tells how a multi billion dollar company can't focus one bit on the user experience for their app on one of their highest revenue business. The app is so horribly slow I could just walk up to the store and buy what I want instead. Yuck!
"Why on Earth have you changed it? If it ain't broke, don't fix and all that. Harder to navigate and the interface now looks as though it's in test mode rather than a fully fledged app."
Ordered twice from them and had a good experience. Fast delivery and the items were just as described. I just wish they'd improve their search feature. It can be really hard to try and find exactly what you want.
Convenient and efficient app. I prefer using the browser-based interface on my PC. This app does fine in a pinch though
"Turd of an app. For a company as large and wealthy as Amazon, their app is complete junk. It's so slow and buggy. The experience is just terrible."
"Amazon has locked me out of my account for over a month. I call them 2 or 3 times a week, and they respond by telling me an account specialist will reach out to me in 1 to 2 business days. No one ever reaches out. By far the most frustrating experience I've ever had with customer service."
"I've ordered from this app a lot, but 50% of the orders results in disaster. I recently ordered some cupcake holders and not only did the delivery guy destroy our outside decorations, but he THREW the package behind a bush with the destroyed decorations. I couldn't even rate the experience because apparently negative experiences aren't taken seriously at Amazon."
ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE since updating to the new user interface. Unusable and very cumbersome. Search features are now useless.
"A really bad experience, not only items not being delivered to the right building but items running late even when I paid for delivered, the worst experience ever never buying anything from Amazon."
Really bad experience. Everytime I try to buy. It cancel my order and locksmy account. Then I got a new one. I forgot my password and I would try to use OTP. Then in would put the code and then it would say the page does not work. Never will use again
Horrible experience with Amazon. They claim 2 packages were delivered to my home and nothing showed up. 200 dollars down the drain. They are impossible to contact as well. Will never use this service again.
"don't bother with this garbage. interface sucks, ads block buttons, it's just impossible to navigate on android. better off visiting through web browser."
App works great but i hate it keeps changing my interface language to spanish every time a friend sends me a link(they use amazon in spanish) but it doesn't change back to english unless i go to the language settings
Trash - horrible navigation & user experience
The application is filled with bugs and it's just a horrible experience. I would expect SO much better from a FAANG company. The chat with customer service page doesn't go up with the keyboard so you can't see what you're typing when you're typing which is completely stupid. How does stuff like this get past testing?
Can't contact sellers to once ordere placed. Amazon customer service chat isn't live. AI responds and nothing can be sorted live. Only after waiting time and reply from representative. Poor customer service experience. This is what happens when people are replaced with AI.
"Have had a great experience with the app until recent updates. Now it's slow, loads a little weird or doesn't load at all."
very bad service I never buy again when I order my items I recve only few items last one I didn't recve when I ask to customer service they told me my order is lost what is this I'm very disappointed this all staff also they too much careless and they told me refund my money but still I didn't recve msg or email from that side it's very bad experience 😡😡
Wonderful shopping experience. You can shop with confidence because their return policy is second to none. I use it almost every day as their delivery service and advice on delivery times is quite marvellous.
"Can't see item descriptions. They are cut off in the app on my new phone. Never had a problem before, but the interface is wonky now. Please fix"
"I ca no longer hold down the heart icon and select a list. This really negatively impacts my use of the app. I pay for Prime, so I expect to have a good app experience."
"Shopping on Amazon has been a fantastic experience. I feel that with their excellent product base and second to none customer service, my family and I will continue to look to them with our shopping needs!"
Have had a great experience with Amazon so far only one issues when item said it was delivered but never came but was refunded. It later revealed that item was out of stock
I see I already rated this one star for when they added auto play ads... Now they moved the search to the bottom with no way to change it... Really trying to make experiences as unpleasant as possible? Just give a layout choice...
Worst experience ever! The last 2 things I've ordered from Amazon never showed up. 1 just never came in or refunded and the other is super late. I'm done with Amazon!
"Always a great experience buying from amazon, and great user interface, I can find everything I need without any trouble."
"Amazon is the best company I've ever used! I had to order a new gaming headset. When I ordered it, Amazon said it would take 5 days. And it literally took less than 2 days to be delivered! I didn't even use Amazon Prime! Thank you Amazon for making me have a great experience!"
enable a dark mode. Not thatdifficult.You cannot trust reviews on Amazon because they ban you from writing anything personal about your experience with shipping or the seller or the price or if it's available better elsewhere so there's no truth to the reviews on this website be carefull the reviews cuz they're all censored. Amazon would rather build rockets than make it safe honest website for us the customer they only protect the seller and China they love censoring for China kill Bezos
Used to love amazon. I can say from my experience lately that the company has become pure garbage. the customer service is garage. the products are garage. buyer beware. Amazon added a subscription to my account without my permission and billed/shipped me an item i did not order.
"To say the least, my experience was AWFUL. I ordered an item, a coat respectively, waited for it for 1 and half month, AND didn't recieve my item!!! A WORST APP I EVER EXPERIENCED!!"
"I have been suffering from the side effects of blood cancer and amyloidosis, plus the weekly chemo treatments for months, all of which has caused me to have a lack of appetite and insomnia. Since taking VitaGrade Hemp Gummys for just a short while now, I have experienced a lot of relief. I can fall asleep in bed, finally, and I get better rest. Plus, I can eat better. The gummys really seem to be helping me a lot. What a relief!"
Amazon shipping for non prime members is one of the worst experience you can have. Whenever I bought any item directly from Amazon it took 15-20 days to arrive. I will choose other reputed retailer anytime.
"I absolutely love shopping with Amazon! They are always on top of their game. I have had some not so good experiences, however, they have always corrected their mistakes."
"Bad experience at Amazon: Two items i didn't receive... i paid already the items trough atm debit card. (1.) Bosch Electric Grinder, (2.) Plastic Covers Electric Plug. Until this time i didn't receive the items. No explanation from Amazon..... PLEASE RETURN MY MONEY!!!"
Amazon has finally started to play with people's money first we ordered a dashboard mat and they sent a hairdryer then we asked for a refund it took a week and they decided to put it on a Amazon gift card so I had to call and request my money back on my debit card and they said it will take another week for that just a all out horrible experience then we ordered a custom tag and it said delivered and we never received the package we waited all day for it and it never came Amazon is now horrible.
I have always had really good experiences shopping Amazon until this year.. lost packages missing parts no way to know if you have received a credit for items lost ..I'm a little leery now
"Terrible update. The app use to be so fast. The dark mode is gone, to go to your wish list you need at least to book annual leave. Absolutely terrible experience."
Newest interface looks like they let a kid design it in PowerPoint with gradient effects and transitions. UI no longer flows nicely
Shopping online from amazon has been a great experience for me. I order the items I want and they shipped them to me in a timely manor. Amazon believe in helping their customers and amazon believe in saling items with quality as well as quanity to meet their customers needs.
"These packets are excellent in keeping the house free of ants once the initial attack has been diminished. Experience tells me these are good for at least a year. Of course the best is ""all natural"" to avoid animal & bird...& human toxicity. gin"
Love this app I can find anything I need for a decent price over all easy to use great shopping experience. They also except EBT for some items contactless delivery overall a great app to download I highly recommend
"I finally updated app this week and it's a new prettier interface but slower. Selecting items to peruse, reading reviews, there was a delay when I click on them."
"What's wrong with you admin ? I had very bad experienced with this Amazon,my account has automatically disappeared,I bought so many products on cash on delivery,I had some points to redeem and I kept some selected products on carts now I can't find my choosen products and points are gone,this is very wired."
"We need a Dark Mode 🌙 Most of us prefer to use amazon app before sleeping or at a late time of night ⭐ So the white "" app interface "" isn't a good choice I hope that soon we get an update contains a dark mode feature"
"You know you can't beat Amazon. I've only had one bad experience, but it wasn't Amazon's fault. Even with the bad experience, everything was super straightforward, I was refunded, and all was well. 5/5, boys."
"It won't let me cancel the installation of the app, and it's still downloading. The app itself was a bad experience being that most of the stuff I got off of there was torn before it got to my house."
"Excellent shopping experience, security to delivery items like smartphone needs looking and tighten as I have received an empty box before but was replaced without any stress."
Worst experience what's the point of subscription of prime when deliveries could not come on time. Waited for almost whole day after several confirmation from logistics that order would reach yet no sign and when asked to change delivery address they don't have a policy what a sick joke to tell you the truth Noon is way better learn something from them
"Waste of Data And effort, i never experience before like this Application. can't open after you set region/country then click US. After that the App automatically can't open, if this is case i already uninstalled this Appilication."
"Ordered many times, never received the items just refunds. I dont recommend it, also poor customer support. Worst experience I ever had. (Amazon US)"
The new wish list layout is terrible. After years of living how wish lists are displayed the developer has ruined the experience.
Very poor delivery experience. They are not delivering product on promising time and customer service agent are saying there is nothing in their hand.
Pages stall or do not scroll at all. Very slow and frustrating shopping experience. Recommendations still showing wrong gender.
App is really glitchy and slow. Really need to switch to a native experience or write better a better web client.
"The most horrible customer service experience. Was waiting for a package to be delivered,the agent did not even attempt delivery .canceled and returned the shipment .Not at all trustworthy .such a shame"
The app has become horrible after recent update. Can't use it for more than 5 seconds. Terrible experience especially on Black Friday. Someone's gonna write a long COE.
"Keeps freezing on my Motorola g7 power. Had never ever done this before the latest update. I concur with the others about the new interface.... Frustrating, annoying."
My experience here on this App is Great. Happy Holidays for me the Amazon community. Amazon is so helpful to have my items out and delivered earlier or on time. If my items are late due to The Holiday's I understand. Thank you
"Cheating experienced!. Don't choose their delivery choice for paying charge to receive the parcel earlier than normal, which is free delivery. It's not real!. customer service are rude too!!!. 😡😠"
"Extremely sluggish. Scrolling up and down on a product page is a horrible, laggy experience."
Don't use Amazon!!!! You can't get hold of anyone about undelivered items! Spent 180 on a phone that didn't turn up I've had no refund and can't speak to anyone!! This is the last time I'll use Amazon!!! Awful experience!
I encourage everyone to get prime. faster delivery I enjoy the experience n expedited process of delivery.
"Worst customer service I've ever experienced in 40+ years.. worry free guarantee warranty is NOTHING BUT A HASSLE! Amazon, I will never buy another product, service, nada from you!"
"Disappointing Experience I ordered NORTIV 8 Men's Ankle High shoes from Amazon, but my package never arrived, and despite reaching out, I received no satisfactory resolution or refund. Feeling cheated and frustrated. This experience has left me highly dissatisfied. Would not recommend."
"Great truly,bminimum experience from lack of being hired and employment has lead to me have little experience in purchasing from are amazing cellular app..:-(.."
The absurd experience I've had with Amazon over these past 2 weeks is nothing short of horrendous. I'm all for employing foreign people to deal with customer service but if they themselves are unable to properly handle serious issues what is the point. I have had to spend hours in my bank getting my card changed all so I can make my purchases and your agent has me remove and re-add it only for it to not be accepted then they transfer me 5 times and ask me the same stupid questions
I experienced identity theft with company. I was charged over six hundred dollars from my bank account from someone who scanned my credit card and charged items from Amazon to my account. They also had posted a fake number for customer service online under the Amazon company name.
"Great experiences,most of the time... have had a few problems with deliveries but those were immediately corrected by Customer Service....very courteous, responsive and helpful reps."
I am giving it a low rating because I am now discouraged to use this app that came pre-installed on my android because I saw no response from the developer to the countless dissatisfied customers who experienced issues after a recent update. The lack of good customer service is simply bad business.
"I love Amazon. Shipping always arrive on time, or earlier than expected, which is really awesome. Great customer service too. Never had a bad experience thus far."
Awful shopping experience. I have ordered a 500 euro tablet and Amazon.fr blocked my account because they didn't believe that the credit card I am paying with is mine. With blocked account I can't even contact their customer service.
The experience on the site is better. I really don't get why they push the app so much. Just makes me not want to buy on amazon. Yet I have to re-download it for support... what a hassle
Amazon is pretty good about communicating and fast shipping my only problem is some drivers who have a unprofessional attitude when it comes to deliveries they toss the box not knowing what's inside or they drop it a wrong address in an apartment complex this causes confusion among neighbors along with a host of other issues I've had good overall experiences thou
"I could give 0 stars if possible. Customer service 0 Shopping experience 0 Overpriced and damaged items. You don't need to use this service, there are better and cheaper options. Most funny fact. There's no 5 stars reviews , I could hardly find 4 star review and apparently application is ranked 4.6 in store. This must be this some kind of magic."
"Worst experience at all online purchase , worst customer service , nearly no service , 7 monthes with no solution with the refund and no one tell you what is going on or help with anything . I will never use it again ."
Worst experience. Items which are our of stock also showing even filtered. After selection it is showing out of stock. its causing waste of time.
"Overall the shopping experience is good, and the delivery time is excellent! I just think the delivery guys shouldn't be terrified of dogs. I think they should hire people who like dogs and don't have to call you every single time you have a package and want you to come to their vehicle to get it."
"The worst search experience ever! I always end up searching Amazon website through Google cause the Amazon app is so dedicated to its low quality sponsored products, you search a brand name or a brand store and don't get 1 single item of that brand! Please pull it together"
The latest update keeps freezing and overall very slow. It makes the experience a nightmare. Please fix this fast.
I used to love the Amazon mobile app but the search filter options are terrible. It takes soooo much longer to find items. Poor user experience :(
Absolute garbage on all my devices. Constant delays and freezing up. Stick with the browser interface.
Shopping is convenient and easy. Returns are quick with no hassles. Great experience on both ends. Thank you/obr
Every retailer wants to copy the Amazon shopping cart functionality with good reason - it had finessed the consumer experience to a point where it cannot be approved upon. The problem for me is that it is just too easy to buy stuff!
delayed over and over and over and over again. it's been 2 weeks for a prime delivery and the only options that are given is to cancel my order or keep getting delayed for whatever reason. what's PRIME even mean anymore. terrible customer service experience
My experience has been great. Good quality and great price too. They have everything that you want from the plain to the notso plain. Its a good and a great place to shop.
Very good shopping experience
Pretty decent experience with Amazon as long as you understand not everything is going to be right that they ship. Returning the stuff that does not work gets old other than that it's pretty good
"Really good experience. Shipping estimations are garbage, it will say it takes a couple weeks but then it arrives in a couple days. But other than that it is an overall great experience."
I love the online shopping experience with Amazon! I have earned over 150$ in point credits on Amazon this year alone plus that I earned shipping credits on top of the amazing prices!
"I most always have a good experience with Amazon. The shipping and delivery is fast. And if I ever have problems, customer service is extremely helpful."
"Not in love with the redesign user interface, but the app still runs overall really solid. This definitely beats ordering off the mobile app site."
Amazon application is good but Amazon service is very bad as delivery times aren't accurate always late and customer service provides misleading information as they informed me that items are out for delivery then they informed me that the delivery will be within three days. From my experience don't use Amazon
The recent update changed the whole U/I experience. It's like it took a step back. It also no longer has the dates of when a person places their review of a product.
Really bad experience from the call center and delivery when we paid amount more for the delivery after they cannot call us for updates or they cannod send mail even for any issue. Customer service agent is mentioned that we need to check 24/7 there all till we receive our order. Really bad experience
"Awful experience with Amazon's delivery. The courriers will leave package at the door without ringing the doorbell. There is someone home especially during this COVID-19 Pandemic. Just saw the thief that almost got away with my package in her hand. She was startled when the door to my garage opened, she panicked, dropping my package on the ground and ran away. I made this comment on here to share that I have reported this issue numerous times and no improvements have been made. App very bad too."
My experience with Amazon has always been good. And I didn't mean to bring flipkart here but I swear there's no comparison. Amazon slays the market. Customer service is far far better than flipkart.
"My experience has been fantastic, home delivery shopping is for all the good and everyone all the time around the world to the range of products and the ease of international delivery to the world of the future deliverd at your door today"
"I have only had 1 bad experience with a seller. Other than that, everything has turned out great. If I have any problems, they were solved. Easy to buy and if needed, easy to return. I LOVE AMAZON! They have EVERYTHING!"
"it's better than some online delivery company, but hopefully they will deliver it on the day of delivery. it's good but I've experienced that they deliver it a day before delivery date, so it's problem sometimes nobody here in the house to receive it."
Great Experience using this App. Very easy to use and order from. Even ordering customized business cards was extremely easy to do.
"Amazon shopping is so easy, and the one time i wanted an answer on something i was able to send a message and my question was answered in minutes, and on i went iam not big tech guy at all but I only have great things to say about my experiences"
I have very bad experience with Amazon in India I ordered 8000 rupees product from Amazon I missing bcca and got wrong protein that's only 1 kg I ordered 2.5 kh
"Excellent experience, massive selection of everything you could imagine. great deals to be had if you spend the time looking"
Quick story: I bought something on Amazon in 2016 to give to someone. I loved my experience so much I decided to buy some amazon stock. There is a reason Amazon is so successful. They focus on the consumer.
Amazon sellers central has not answered my complaint and questions even once regarding why they won't verified my account as a seller. I have uploaded everything I wanted and they have not told me why they did not approve my documents. This is the worst customer experience I have ever experienced!
All that money and the user experience is still awful. Consumerist BS. I'd rather eat mushy peas every day than share a meal with Bezos
This is my favorite and most opened app on my phone. I love how smooth the interface is and how easy it is to make/track your orders. I highly recommend the app over the website!
Giving 3 stars cause I've had great past experiences but now the app won't go past the white Amazon screen. Even after deleting and reinstalling the app and clearing the cache.
"The Amazon Search on the other hand was not the greatest experience,""that you may also be on the looking-out for regarding their contracted vendors selling me an obsolete program to update files/certificates to cellular device on my first-order for January in the year 2020,that I am still awaiting a full refund from experiencing.The RealInternetMan😎"
package not received nothing is being done to rectify this error I've traded with Amazon for a long time this is the worst experience
"Shoping experience is good, but when you return an item forget that your money will be refunded .. !! You will go through endless back and forth communications without getting your money. At the end they will tell you to talk to your bank .. !!"
"Service is very bad 😔 I don't know it was my first experience . I ordered Laptop and I was going to pay extra to deliver special time but after 1 day I still didn't receive my order. And someone phoned me, and they just said: we going to sand you our location and take yourself , or if you cannot take just we will cancel it. They said. But in the app it's still showing ""you will receive your order today 8pm "" it's just a awful who can solve this issue??????????? I need solution."
"Uh oh... Something has gone wrong on our end Been happening on this Moto G Power and my wife's Samsung Note 8 for the last month. I can use the web interface okay, but the wife's webpage does the same error. Please fix."
Amazon in U.A.E is the worst shopping experience ever. They cancel your order after due delivery date. They might deliver a product that was supposed to be delivered the next day maybe after a month (if you are lucky). Call or chat with them and they keep transferring or hold your chat/call. AMAZON is a JOKE
"Absolutely trash. Good luck finding anything with this terrible user interface. Also, what does one have to do to get things delivered on the date Amazon says it will be there? Trash app from a trash company."
"Judging by the reviews, I guess I should be grateful that the app refuses to install on my tablet. The old app was working just fine - so maybe the developers killed it so they could force this buggy (cr)app on us for job security reasons? This way - they get to be the saviors for fixing their poorly written and designed software? I can tell you this - my Amazon experience has been less than satisfactory lately, and is making me think real hard about renewing my Prime membership."
"Very horrible experience, Delivery guy doesn't want to deliver big items to my place and customer service responded rudely when informed about the delivery malpractice in my region. Fake reasons were given delivery guy and they were supported by customer service. This happened multiple times but still no change. Regards Frustrated customer"
"Im mad at amazon currently. Its been deleting my reviews off of my profile, which is whatever BUT i believe i have the right to voice my opinion about products that is verified that I PURCHASED FROM THEM and a right to share it in the reviews as much as anybody else! I tried contacting customer service but nobody has contacted me back. 😤 youve lost yourself a prime customer, Actually multiple customers as I'll share my experience and how you intentionally silence customers!"
Terrible interface. Terrible product display. Search is almost completely useless and doesn't show products relevant to search.
"very bad experience on amazone pay they are making fool in the name cashback. i pay Rs.589 for rechage my router but it show a glitch that ""there is an error"" like that i dont remember what exactly it shown but clearly i seen my router havent rechaged then i pay again now it show quickly i hav rechaged it. but when i seen my transaction it showing 2 times my money paid and so i called router's costomer care he saying money isnt recieived 2 times , then where my money gone . im still waiting...."
"I don't have this app, I don't want this app. Stop redirecting me to this app. Also forcing me to dowload this app to use the chat feature for Amazon support is just annoying as a tactic to make me get this app. Overall, none of these methods will make me get this app, they do however give a negative customer experience."
"Too much space taken up by the app for zero gain over web experience. I keep installing so I can chat customer service maybe once a year. It's clunky, buggy, and wants more private info than your doctor"
So far buying experience has been very good. Only problem I had was a little longer on the shipping but that is to be experienced with all the COVID protocols.
The update was a mistake. The app is lagging and unresponsive. Are they going to fix it? It's a horrible user experience.
Amazing... Pretty much you can find anything. Super fast delivery and easy return. Much better than other online shopping experience. Highly recommended!!
"They give me guranterd delivery for 2 days with prime. After 2 days they changed it to one week. When i check it after week, now its showing. I want to cancel n refund my mone but amazone refused even its their fault. I got that kind of experience 3 time. Use eBay instead of amazon .they r cheating now"
My first experience with this company was bad...my item was no longer available after I pay for it.and now I have to wait to get my money back..but they didnt wait to take my money...this was my first order and looks like my last...not a happy customer...who know when I get my money back....
"my experience with this app; so far, has been very piss- poor. this app has been declining my Master Debit Card from day 1 : even though ; ive made a valid purchase! im afraid to use this app any further. i feel ripped & violated! i dont know what ive been doing wrong; even though ive followed all instuctions perfectly! i simply do not & never will understand the major malfuntion here#!?..."
"I almost ALWAYS find what i want and top quality. Also refunds are no hassle guarrantee. Very pleasant experience. My only complaint was delivery started throwing our packages down in front of our OUTDOOR mailboxes. So far(as I filed a conplaint) all purchases Have been place at our door as usual. So Thank You All very, VERY MUCH. Verdell Shannon-Murray"
smooth scrolling and good experience overall. The UI is similar to the desktop but well adapted to the mobile landscape.
"**The site is a shopping wonderland for an array of purchasing needs!! I do enjoy the Prime Membership benefits (and my current discounted monthly fee). So far, pretty good buying experiences overall🙂👍🏾🩷"
My experience was horrible i went to order and then they said that i had to go to the store and get a card for them to taje my account off hold. Its pretty dumb how they want you to order but they put your account on hold because you wanted to order something like what the heck.
All the updates are very bad! The user interface sukks...the Save For Later list doesn't automatically load like it used to...
Great customer service. And the product was fantastic! Definitely will use Amazon shopping soon. I received a gift card with my purchase but said I needed to rate my experience who am I supposed to contact for that gift card to be redeemed?
The app is so idiot and not user friendly like souq I can't explore it easily like was Souq I can't find what I'm looking for or search effectively or see prices it's all ranges now 😒 hope to improve it Bad experience unfortunately.
"Love love love for at home shopping, can get anything and everything you need! Never had a bad experience and fast free shipping on lots of items!"
I have had good experiences with the Amazon shopping. Sometimes I'd like a few more of the options available in the desktop version but overall very good
"One of my worst experience I had. We ordered a product last Thursday, I had a confirmation and I received a message I'll get my product on the next following day. I was waiting for the delivery on Friday the driver didn't even try to deliver my parcel. 2. Attempt: same thing. costumer service promised me nex day delivery: same thing happened. When I contacted Amazon I complained to them, the lady from the ""special logistics team"" was put me on hold for literally 30 minutes. Disgusting....."
Search is useless due to advertisements and sponsored products. Interface doesn't even fit on a phone. I dont believe amazon possibly makes its money from doing THIS because it's bad at it
Great app with use friendly interface...
"The worst experience ever!! I ALWAYS have to contact their call centre to complain about me not receiving my order, because even though the carriers have already the address, they try to contact you and when you don't reply they just cancel the shipment. AND the funniest thing is that none of their drivers speak Arabic or English ( I'm in KSA ) So good luck for you to understand what they are saying."
"Ive been with Amazon for some years now and i honestly don't want to be a member anymore, the way things are handled aren't as good as they used to be and im pretty sure your loyalty to there company doesn't matter to them, that's the experience ive been receiving from Amazon."
Moving the search bar to the bottom was an absolutely terrible idea and made the interface so much worse to navigate.
"Terrible. Uninstalled because it stops on the password entry over and over and over again. Now I'm a browser shopper who keeps getting offered the same, broken app for a 'better' experience..."
The worst online shopping point i have ever used first of all delivery is so late and i still didn't get my items then they informed me that item is out of stock when date is near all i can say is my first and worst experience ever....
"I love shopping with Amazon. Customer service is easy, friendly and speedy. Makes the online shopping experience easy and fun."
"Absolutely fabulous app, does all you want and more. Great on -line shopping experience and an equally enjoyable service. It couldn't be better"
"This is by far the worst user interface I have ever seen it is so hard to find anything and even going to your profile it just loads for like 5 minutes and times out you're better off using the desktop version of the site, I mean come on Devs!"
"This is the far most shopping experience I've ever had. Great prices, and I'm also an amozon prime member, which is also a great price per month."
"Amazon is a brilliant online shopping experience that is second to none and to prove that point, I am coming into my 7th year with Amazon and the bonus is the awesome online video selection available and that makes me so happy to be alive."
"My Experience has been great, shoes,purse and can opener were exactly what I wanted. They were all in great shape, looking forward to my next item. Thank you Amazon"
Great shopping experience. Lots of inventory items listed and always a great place to compare prices and reviews. Fast and convenient delivery.
"Worst experience I've ever had, they take your credit card and lock you out of your account then give you the run around and tell you they can't give you access to the private information you've given them, such a sketchy company with sales. I do not recommend spending money through this company. Less than one star."
"Excellent shopping experience. The only problem I have with Amazon is they make it way too easy to spend money, way to go Bezos!"
"Keep reverting language settings to French. When changing to English, the interface remains in French but search results are in English."
I'm starting to like this website it teaches me things on interests I've never got to experience in my life
"Worst customer service experience ever. They lost my return parcel and blame me for that, not only asking me to pay for an item I do not have but accusing me for stealing the item too. Customer service a brick wall of automated responses. Stay away."
Bad experience with Amazon as they closed the account without any reason as they told me that I had another account before and that isn't true and also they cancelled one of my orders without any reasons.
"my experience with Amazon order on line was costly, some one from their department hacked my credit card and charged on it close to a (1000$) and Amazon did not dispute the charges, said your bank should reimburse you the money, I will never buy anything from Amazon."
I am a regular user n have had nothing but the best experiences with everything! I love this app. I am currently a Prime member n would recommend the membership to everyone. The benifits n services are unbeatable especially for the value. Try it out for free even! 5 stars for sure!
"Besides the 1 time I ""got the desk I ordered"" when I really didn't someone up the street had it for a week,i have nothing but good experiences with amazon. It's the first app I go to shop for something."
So many scammers inside. Need to be aware all the time. First i had good experience. But later on i recieved fake items and used items. Now almost all bad low quality items are there. I'm going to stop using this application
Been a member about a year. I have had nothing but a great experience with them so far. Packages on time. Items arrived undamaged and Most items meet my expectations.
DEAR AMAZON😡🤬 After a week of waiting on my order for a 3 drawer with lock they Decided to cancel my dam order not appreciated BTW Amazon THAT THE WORST COSTUMER SERVICE!!! YES I WAS REFUNDED BUT BUT WHAT THE HELL I WAS DEPENDING ON THAT DRESSER B4 I MOVE TO MY NEW PLACE the worst experience ever BTW THEY DIDNT GIVE.ME NO NOTIFICATIONS AT ALL THAT IT WAS CANCELLED ON ME WITH NO EXPLANATION
Ridiculously SLOW!!!!! Since a few months ago that the app upgraded to a new style it is totally USELESS!!! Dreadful shopping experience !
Bad experience on Amazon.in. My sim is deactivated and now I am not able to login to my account. And I am not able to contact to customer care. A bad experience from me because today only I order something and I am not able to login.
It's just a horrible spammy experience. And the app is obviously designed by people in a 101 class in terms of layout and efficiency.
One of the WORST online shopping experiences I ever had. Every thing goes normal until you have a problem with one of your items refund or delivery then they turn their heads away and escape from responsibility. Don't recommend dealing with them at all.
"Had a terrible experience today.... I ordered for a buckle free belt from Amazon prime and I got a notification message saying it's delivered to my letterbox, however nothing is found in my letter box... I haven't received my item yet...The address is given correctly... I either need a refund or my item.."
The customer service is very bad. They don't care about you as a customer they care about giving you any answer even if it is not related. They start to make up some policies to just get rid of you. Every agent I call gives me a new answer even the supervisor. Not sure if this is the service I am looking for. There are plenty of online stores out there. I think it is time to find some robust alternative. Thanks for a bad 👎 experience.
"Overall, Amazon has been wonderful! Experienced one glitch recently as they are using other companies to fill my order and I did not received my purchase..a couple books I bought."
Normally I have a good experience--- tough luck trying to order anything during the holiday season. It's such a shame-- pay for a service & never get to take advantage of that service. Also poor guest recovery.
"First order and they have put my account on hold asking me for card and bank info and all that nonsense, never had this issue with AliExpress asking me for extremely personal information, what a terrible experience from amazon. Just disaapointing"
Most worst Delivery System ! They took money for prime membership and they will deliver as they like .. if contact customer service even they will say they can't do anything. I faced this bad experience most of my orders .. most worst Delivery System (delivery no guarantee on time )
"I am amazed about how Amazon is now taking pictures of your package at your house safely delivered!!! that is just amazing!! I love it... great idea, and it makes me respect the experience you are very trusted in my book!"
"I fu king hate this app.... I bought a phone case... im not a phone case collector. I dont want to see more things I've bought again, I want to see a random list of cool things normal people like. Stop personalizing the experience"
Now you are limited to 25 items per page and it makes the shopping experience suck! Seriously considering switching to another e-commerce site!
"Terrible shopping experience. Too many ""sponsored"" listings. Filtered searching doesn't really filter anything, just provides more sponsored content. I regret being a prime member."
Amazon is horrible.. horrible service.. horrible drivers.. horrible products... Nothing but horrible experiences. Even after countless chances to change my mind about them they keep with the same horrible everything.
"This app is terrible, i want to change payment method in the order and it not responding at all. How you can order the goods with such a app? On pc no issue... This is the worst buying experience ever ! Hope this app will be completely redone"
The filters are very bad. . No option to even select size of footwear. . I'm surprised that shopping experience has gotten bad after Amazon took over. . The app sucks.
Very bad I order one item on august 2023 But didn't receive the item or refund the amount Very bad experience Flipkart is far better than Amazon Very bad customer service
Update is horrible. I now have to go searching for my lists which definitely makes the whole experience pretty pathetic and annoying.
my experience is horrible customer service sucks they say that my credit card was declined my credit card company says that they paid it so Amazon is taking my money and you can't get back because there's no way to contact anyone you're taking full advantage of this pandemic
non stop pictures of dogs saying something went wrong on their end. that pretty much sums up my experience with this app. it is incredibly frustrating.
"Amazon is the best shopping experience since the opening of Walmart, yet they have surpassed Walmart with their customer service, their prices and their delivery is outstanding... all this from sitting in my chair without having to track down one single human being to find something on an aisle somewhere. if I was a betting man I would bet on Amazon to absorb the Walmart corporation in the future."
Had a horrible experience. They blocked my acc and kept charging me for canceled orders. I spended over 600$ on orders il never receive. Aparently i had the worst experience with this shopping site. Lost lots of money. :(
WORST SHOPPING EXPERIENCE EVER! With the last update daily deals can no longer filter the department. Now must scroll thru everything if I only looking 4 Lawn & Garden. Frustrating always something not working right with each update.
"Absolutely amazing customer service, great interface, basically no bugs, works well in any connection. Great app!"
"My experience has been more satisfactory. Sure,I've had to return items, but that's the risk we take when shopping online. I also realize that I am making Mr. Bezos alot richer. I may limit my future purchases and focus on my own prosperity."
"Amazon has become the Gold Standard for the On Line Shopping Experience. Super easy and convenient to use, everything just works in a very intuitive way! IMHO"
Nonsensical update placed search bar at the bottom with no option to change to the top as it was previously and is a long established standard user experience.
"I have had problems with deliveries getting delivered to the house behind me and today, I finally had an amazing amazon delivery driver named james. I caught him and he drove in front of my house and made sure the location was pinned. Thank you so much james for my package around the Litchfield area! He was phenomenal with customer service and had a smile on the entire time! Best experience by far with someone making sure the problem.doesnt happen again! -Kerrie"
I had bad experience with order i paid shipping for item while its free from china to dubai and again i paid shipping for price exactly same as usb price which is not fare at the end the item didn't work for pubg game. I said from that day i will never buy from Amazon.
An absolute horrible experience since the last major update certain pages like lists or color option pages take absolutely forever to load if they load at all really wish I could revert the update
"Overall, good experience though navigating on the site was never easy. Watch your spelling and be as accurate as possible."
Very bad user experience
Sort & filter options are awfully complicated. Souq app was way better & user friendly. Please put more effort in this interface.
"I have had nothing but great experiences with Amazon. My order has always been on time, or has arrived sooner. Glad that I shop with Amazon and will continue to do so."
Absolutely horrendous user experience after the latest update. Layout doesn't make any sense at all and the app feels a lot more sluggish than before. Hope they will reconsider this update.
"I have never had a bad experience with Amazon. They are fast, convenient and a reliable site to buy things you love at a affordable price most of the time."
"I was obsessed with Amazon. Today I had a bad experience. I was delivered My neighbor's package who lives in another building next to mine. I was also looking out for my package with an $100+ item inside. When I went to take her item, she handed me mines. Our building letters are Completely different. Also our apartment numbers are completely different. Idk how they made that careless mistake. I'm afraid to order again."
Good experience until now. I have had the app stop responding three times whenever I try to search something. There is a bug in the system.. please fix.
"cluttered mess user interface, just horrible, for exampe, i can not find the the logout button option anywhere. its so well hidden"
"Fix your app! That last update has a good interface but search filters are sorting tools only, i want the old filters back (prime only items for one)"
"Changed from decent app to total garbage with the latest update. I live in Spain and had English language configured for the user interface. Now some bird brain at Amazon decided that there will only be Spanish language available if Amazon Spain is set as store. Also what's up with the new ugly colors? Dear morons at Amazon, please learn rule #1 in software development: Don't touch things that are working."
I don't have much experience because I hardly order on line. I knew there were people who ordered and they liked it. I only order the covers for my car's sheet and was good. Keep up your good work.
Amazon has ruined the user experience. The menu at the bottom-right on Android no longer opens. Can't see any options. Can't see my past orders. Doesn't Amazon test the app's updates before releasing them?
"In the past 4 years I have purchased more than 150 items from Amazon. My experience has been that more than one third (1/3) of the items I have ordered, many at full price, are in some way flawed, functionally inferior, and falsely described. Many of those are of grossly 'cheap' quality. I am seriously disappointed; and see many other equally negative customer reviews after each upgrade. You are a huge company and should not be as careless and deceptive of your faithful customers."
"Doesn't ever work. Update: still doesn't work. I give up on it..from my experience this app has been an aggravating waste of time, that prevents me from shopping on Amazon."
"Really poor experience with this app recently. Seems so buggy, scrolling thru the deals pages and images are there then not there. Not great needs fixed"
The interface of the app is very bad and disappointing. Souq app was much more user friendly and filter options were much better in Souq than Amazon.
"Always the go to place to order online, quick service.. Usually the better prices. Very rare do I ever experience a bad one with amazon."
Used to be snappy and great shopping experience. Lately app has been choppy to load and images wouldn't always load. Hope next update fixes that.
Most of the time awesome experience.. Sometimes it fails. But very easy and convinient home shopping app with lots of option at good price
"Works well, use friendly. Not a fan of ads, but they're efficient and relevant, but sometimes interfere with the shopping experience."
Amazon thinks they need to change their app all the time. The new layout is terrible. Please stop making changes to the interface.
it is Amazon in the convenient form of an app. Easy shopping experience. Not sure Prime is worth the money but everyone's opinion is different.
"Awfull experience! fist time I place an orden and it's delayed on delivery no reason or explaination given plus no accurate information /status until 8:00 pm, I had to wait all day until that time to be notified that I was not getting my product today, very very upsetting!!! Not sure will order again!"
Not a well polished experience from a multi billion dollar company. Get results totally unrelated to the search. Usually overpriced and eBay is a much better user experience
Nightmare...Amazon supplier auto order...amazon auto charge...i just woke up getting charrge for an order i never made...so disappointing...bad experience...my linked card is not safe anymore so i removed it immediatly...customer service hang up (youve been hit with a snag)...
"Recently reinstalled due to more storage on phone. Interface is easy to use, very easy to navigate between wishlists and basket, add gift card and place order."
"Pretty good but the interface is a bit buggy at times, mostly when scrolling through deals or similar pages, phantom clicks mean you end up on the product page, and the deals end up misaligned after a while."
Extremely poor product variety and mostly overpriced. Shipping time for a domestic parcel takes a month average! A downer for any online shopper. Gave it 2 stars for the user interface only.
"Good interface, could use more filters but the ones they have are helpful. Good images. Trustworthy store."
Great Shopping experience. Items ship in timely fashion. Prompt Customer Service. Most of my shipments have been delivered in nice packaging. I prefer Amazon' s over Ebay's.
Having bad experience here! Would it be possible to get darker themes for this app and or in general (i.e. webpsite) it's irritating my eyes with all that white background while looking trying to shop for things!
"We love our shopping experience with Amazon, they are professional that shose that they care about there member needs. There is a easy item return, if you didn't receive you item (s) they will replace them with a smile. We love Amazon Prime it has been a blessing for me & my ministry staff in our down time listening to music with such crisp sounds as if they are using BOSS SPEAKERS & SURROUND SOUND for varies Movies that we watched. We rate Amazon a 10 across the board. J Duncan"
Ive had an amazing experience with the app. Customer service is the best and have always solved my issues in time and perfectly. Thank you!
"Used a shipping hub for delivery... Was a good experience, I got it on time and it was super easy to pick up, was happy with my order 100%! Thank u for great service."
Poor experience. Always go for local alternative instead of multi tiered multi national. These guys can't resolve any issues.
The interface is confusing to some and it took away most of the daily deals and things of that nature.. dont use near as often as I used to.
"Always a fantastic shopping experience, and the only one that I will use, fabulous prices and the best brands are always available! A must have app for android and a amazing experience!!"
"Almost 10 years user of amazon. Today is the most disappointing experience. I ordered sony xperia 5 v worth 3,400 aed. I received oppo a17 worth 400 aed in the market. ??!!!"
The app runs smoothly and the interface is easy to manage. The features help navigate easily through the categories.
"Overall experience with Amazon is Good, But only problem now a days is all orders done have taken almost 10 days to deliver inspite of having prime membership. ** Only one order after is coming in 2 days after loading above msg. New order still the same. Delivery time my main concern"
I have had a few bad experience with parcels but mostly good ones its quick efficient easy to browse and understand also items are so easy to find delivery is quick by amazon also
It was very bad experience to use amazon to deliver my order. The delivery guys they cancelled my order from himself because he doesn't like to come to my place however 😤 🙃 there is many company they are delivering to my place. The customer service he can only apologise but no action will happen.
"Amazon offers the easiest, most reliable, all-around best online shopping experience ever! I definitely recommend to anyone; KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK! :-)"
My package came late and it was important because i need it the next day it arrived so i just wasted my money for no reason like you guys had one job to get it right and you failed everything is so expensive to even have to pay for shipping worst experience i had buying online.
"I don't have any experience about the Amazon, but trying to set up some shopping business with you'll company, I am willing to purchase some few items with the shopping cart."
As far as the app experience it's been good for me they have were you can just sign up and do shopping but they also have amozon prime it cost around 12-13 dollars a month if you shop a lot or just need things for the house than this app is for you happy shopping
"It's been a great experience for me with Amazon, even when things don't fit or you made an error requesting something, it is a no hassle return."
I am sick of asking to only display items that can be shipped to my address to have returned over 50% of displayed items not being able to be shipped to me. Terrible user experience.
"Bad interface, seems to be intentionally made for accidentally ad clicks. Overall frustrating to use."
Bad experience. Ive ordered and paid it by card and recieved notification that they will deliver it today so i tracked the order then its not showing in the system. its a completely lie.
"Absolutely terrible customer service with ZERO empathy for people, even if they're trying to operate their business on a timeline. Customer service member cannot comprehend what I'm saying, even when I say, ""howdy,"" they respond with, ""I am good, thanks. How about you?"" I ordered a NEW product, not cheap, either. Got sent a USED/REFURBISHED item that had been modified with damaged packaging. SO dissatisfied with my experience. Even the returns process is nonsense."
Horrible UX experience with this. Had to go through tooth and nails to find invoices for my previous order just to give up on it and open my laptop to obtain the data. Yall need better UX staff.
User experience in the wish list is very slow. Lots of lag. Not responsive UI at all.
This is thw worst experience ever i was using my browser to access amazon before cos anytime im asked to enter my password when i do it will tell me incorrect password i have to change my password Everytime i use Amazon and sometimes it doesnt work. I downloaded the app now it still samething fix your stupid site and app
The new interface is a step in the wrong direction. It has gone from being intuitive to being a hassle. What were the programmers thinking?
Seamless shopping experience. Always easy to use and very straight forward. Never had a problem yet.
Very poor service very bad quality please don't buy from this app not refund money and gift voucher as for in 7days refund money but they are return goods but not refunded voucher or money lot of time I contact Amazon customer they are told in 24 hours refund your blanc but never refund please take care in the world people very very poor bad app Amazon shopping my experience I request to all don't shopping frome the amazone.
Easy to use. One suggestion it will be to get the 'contact us' in a better and easier place to find it. Customer experience is good.
Terrible experience. Wasted two whole days waiting for an order. I call them and they are totally inept in even having the correct order information. Then promised it would be delivered yesterday by 10 pm then this evening at 8 pm and called at 9:24. I do not think they know how to do an efficent job. Cancelled my order and will never order anything from them again. Save yourself the stress and agivation of dealing with them. Never again will they waste time which is precious to me.
"horrible, silly and unorganised. you should have kept Souq interface or just do something similar. you lost most of your clients against your competitors due to this change."
I would have liked to rate amazon with 5 stars as it was one of the best online shopping applications but I also gave the 2 stars only to show respect to those who still have criteria of good customer service in amazon....worst customer service experience my husband had in his life was today and lately we couldn't help to notice that customer service level in amazon is getting lower and lower standards even for prime members....sooooo sad and so disappointed 😔
"I do most of my online shopping on the AMAZON SHOPPING APP. It is so easy to find what your looking for, whether it be for quality or the best price. In my experience, chances are you will find what you are looking here!!!"
I've had a great experience on Amazon it's easy to find stuff there and I've had the products shipped to me in great shape.
Good app experience. An exception: try before you buy checkout did not allow for returning some items. Every thing therefore was returned.
So far the experience has been pretty good with Amazon KSA. The last order got delivered well on time (to be precise before the given delivery date )and the product was genuine.
"Good shopping experience, all prices and costs are upfront. The problem so far for me is the frequent currency changes to USD after its set to my local currency ZAR"
"despite amazon monopolizing almost everything in the world they can't come up with a decent app, very poor UI and experience with the app is also phenomenally abnoxious"
Good luck using it to scan gift cards. You better have the nerves of a surgeon to hold the camera exactly right. Very aggravating experience.
"New update is killing app. I'm having trouble accessing my account, orders, past orders. Ever since the new update my experience has been a disaster."
"Nearly every aspect of the shopping experience is good, from purchases to returns. The app is well designed and easy to use."
I mostly have good experiences shopping Amazon. I get tickled when they sell items not yet in stock. SMH I love the variety.
typically a world class experience. occasionally a nightmare. new lockers are a great solution for troubled shipping locales
Amazon shopping at your fingertips with a streamlined interface for touchscreens. Amazon is the champion of online stores.
"Frequent shopper and love checking out the deals of the day. Now that the deals aren't available, the shopping experience isn't as fun."
I have had bad experience with Amazon they take the money out for my orders according to my bank I don't recurve my orders on time or they don't send the items they don't refund my money eather I am dissapointed in Amazon in the last year or two
Basically runs like a web app. App doesn't run like a nice native experience and frequently fails to load item pages.
honestly I don't give a dam who see this review from amazon all these people who are reviewing could not be lying everything they are saying is true I have already experienced first hand from not receiving a package or waiting all day long for a package and it never arrived to receiving the wrong package however I did speak to someone in customer which I did get my money back and my account was canceled also I never became a prime member so I deleted the app no regrets their service is trash
I had my first experience with Amazon I ordered a Chrome laptop on the 9th of January and I received it on the 11th of January it was everything I expected plus some the product was great more than what I expected thanks Amazon.
excellent app easy to navigate they go above and beyond to make sure your experience as a customer is the best!
glitchy and jumpy. I'll be looking at items and the app will reset. i prefer the desktop experience
"I adore Amazon, always have always will. It makes my shopping experience SO much easier and definitely faster!"
"What can you say about Amazon shopping on the app apart from why would you shop anywhere else? Get yourself an Amazon Prime membership and get the full experience. This year alone. 198 parcels all delivered next day, free of charge."
"Back around the 60's I would say Amazon is ""far out"". Today, I will say, Amazon is a pleasant, dependable and awesome experience. Customer for 11 years now."
Amazon only post good reviews. I experienced trouble from supplier of products and the product itself. But it doesn't post it.
Best on line shopping experience ever!! Amazon have anything n everything anyone may need or want. And the return policy n customer service have no rival!
I haven't been able to have that experience with it yet. I've got a bunch of cards out there that we're supposed to be free that I applied for I haven't gotten them yet so what makes you think I'm going to even get this I'm not impressed yet everything that is supposed to be free that I've signed up for I HAVEN'T RECEIVED ANY OF THIS FREE STUFF AND IT'S BEEN MONTHS HELL ALMOST 2 FREAKING YEARS !!!!
"I hardly review stuff, but I got to take the time to do this one. The best App and customer service experience EVER!!! From a fully satisfied customer. I highly recommend!"
"Worst online shopping experience I've had so, I paid for an item over a month ago it never came! And it took even longer for them to refund my money."
My experience using this app is not good. My order not delivered when the stuff is for delivery they will cancel my order and marked that the item is cancelled by me
The app can be buggy sometimes not being responsive but it has great user interface and it is easy to navigate
"What a bad experience with Amazon first time. I got 2 items from my order and 3rd item they mentioned will be delivered soon on 26 April 2020. 26 April is gone, i am trying to contact customer service but no response and there is no any contact number to call."
Very poor experience. Unable to log out once logged in and zero help available for missing items. First and Last time I'll be using amazon for anything.
"I have ordered by Amazon 6 time, everytime came not my parsel.i am amazome customer last 6 year. I found Amazon is the cheapest company. I have very bad experience with Amazon. Totally rubbish amazon.i am not order more with Amazon"
Glitchy and annoying to navigate. I love browsing but the experience is mediocre compared to desktop browser
"I had only good experience with shopping here. Also, when I needed help, I had a very kind, quick, helpful assistant Igor in chat."
"LOVE LOVE LOVE IT..THE BEST SHOPPING EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER FOUND!!! EVERYTHING I HAVE EVER NEEDED I FOUND ON THIS SITE, AND THEIR ""DELIVERY ""IS ""SUPERB"" ! I'D GIVE IT A TEN STAR IF POSSIBLE!!!!"
great shopping experience but bad delivery experience i've have a coule items that said where delivered and never got so I changed it to amazon hub locker it's more secure and guaranteed to receive items 100%
"not for everyone, but I had a pretty bad experience with Amazon and it's customer care and they are justifing there stand, and I'm still having issues."
"Doesn't install on s7. App for tablet being discontinued and the website ui experience being painful tried this option. No success , Amazon experience going backwards."
"Order placed and money paid, refuse to deliver after a week of wait time then put a ""Undeliverable"" notification and nothing else, what do you mean? where is my stuff? where is my money? Classic amazon experience :)"
"Interface serves itself on a whim, search bar arbitrary moved to bottom of screen. No user control is the issue here."
"TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE , cant even search for the item i want , i get lost and lost , what happened to the previous search ? did something changed in algorithm !!! Cant believe alixpress is faster at funelling my search damnnnnn"
Has bug's and lagging so much and keeps kicking me off the app saying it isn't working after this last update :( making it difficult to search for goods... This is the first time i have experienced this
They lie about deliver dates to get you to buy you can not submit negative feedback just says we're having trouble have had bad experiences with over 3 items now and still can not leave feedback plus last item I had to go pickup 2 days later then was to be delivered
Shopping experience is pretty nice. That data usage of the app has increased drastically in recent updates though.
"Amazon is currently like THE best app, I can shop , and buy it is AWESOME 👍😎. My favorite experience was when I wanted to find out how much it costs to buy a Tears of the kingdom amibo and it took me no time AT ALL 😀😀😎👍"
"My experience with this app on may 31st is when I payed 152.12 cent and started canceling my item's without my approval,lack of security,stole money from customer without a refund,late deliveries,lack of professionalism. My advice to all who use this this app don't do it."
Im usually satisfied with my Amazon shopping experience from their online store The odd time an item arrived but the color and sizes were incorrect..⁰ they were fast @producing my refund via email alerting me of redirect deposit into my account... Well done Amazon⁰
Least intuitive user interface ever. Also regularly timing out and re-downloading data already downloaded.
"When I open the chat and try to type something, the window doesn't resize together with the keyboard, resulting in a bad experience because I can't see what I'm typing"
Worst experience in the world ..... I ordered an item on Thursday 6th July an paid extra charges for quick delivery..... Today is Sunday 9th July 7:26pm ....I haven't got my delivery.....😡😡😡😡😡 I loose contracts because of that..... Worst Customer service....you call them and they calm you but still nothing is done to resolve the issue.
Had a pleasant experience until Amazon charged me $139 USD despite not using Prime. Canceled the 14 day trial after 4 days. Haven't received a refund and nobody will answer my questions. Absolutely ridiculous. DO NOT RECOMMEND.
"My experience with Amazon is just wonderful and I mean it nothing nor wrong always on time and very friendly Newberry have i had an complaint and if your wondering what to shop here is what you should go and no, I'm a real life person LOL I've heard people say about these things and even myself to didn't think reviews was real but take it from me its awesome to have Amazon."
Always a pleasant experience. I love that I find almost everything I search for everytime. Delivery is amazing!!
Much better experience than using a browser. Would lie to sort orders by delivery due date though.
"Scalping central. Its disgusting that Amazon allows for people to resell its for double or triple the prices and what isn't scalpers ruining the experience its vendors miss representing products or selling the litteral cheapest quality product possible. Maybe protect and stand up for the customers, how does that sound Jeff and staff?"
"App experience is awful. Every time I use the search bar, ""oops, something went wrong.🤷🏽‍♂️"" literally every. time."
The best shopping experience! I love the convenience of shopping at any hour. Amazon always has what I need.
Never have had a bad experience or purchase. Amazon prime is well worth the expence of membership considing no shiping and handling fees.
"Please bring back drag and drop shopping lists and offer a custom interface, the color scheme chosen is difficult to look at."
The app could use some more optimization to make the experience smoother and give a better impression overall.
Trying to buy a show had to go expressly to the website not the app to buy it which took WAY too long because every link took me to the stupid app. Please slap Bazos in the face for this aggravating experience
"Works as good as the website, haven't experienced any difficulties yet and I've had it for over a month now with 6+ purchases"
I want to uninstall it you'll have too many issues people calling acting like they're you and you're not so I cannot take that chance because I'm not a rich person. I will not install you just yet I'll give you a few days to respond but for the most part I've really had no good experiences from y'all. First off I can't afford anything you'll have to sell. And you'll give no credit of any sort. But who gets credit nowadays. I'm going to give it a couple more days and see what happens
very bad experience I had to wait my order for 2 weeks and then got my order canceled by amazon and had to wait for 7 more days to get my money back !!!
Very bad experience happened last day... They are taking delivery charges and giving damaged materials. Refund is also taking huge time.
Worst customer service experience ever not recommending you to anyone. Honestly to throw packages on doorsteps and then have the audacity to ask me to call back 48 hours and yall would resolve the issue. I did just as yall asked me to do and then I waited 3 to 5 business days for a refund yall promised me. Never using Amazon again and anyone related to me that uses Amazon imma make sure they know yalls customer service care isn't worth the time and hassle to order from you.
"Always had a góod experience shipping on track, there customer service is very good. Thank you Amazon.."
I actually like Amazon the low score is really for the work experience I had while employed with them a few years back they not only were racist they were bias there was obvious discrimination and they even iffered me a severance letter and a payment to keep my mouth shut I felt orrssured to make a decision bribed and like I was not being taken seriously they did however admit fault I didn't sign the contract in time because I had been pregnant at the time moving and was in a accident.!
Trashy shipping experiences even when u pay for prime. Happened again and again for so long. Can't deal with it.
"The best experience ever!! Nothing but the best PRODUCTS, SERVICE, PRICES, AND DELIVERY TIME!! Can't beat this site with anything."
"One of the worst experience with Amazon UAE, recently played a paid order through prime but it has been 3 days till now didn't receive the package,DONT USE AMAZON or Don't placed paid order you will money and time"
"Responsive and well designed for shopping experience app, but some menu is hard to find like profile and customer support"
"Worst application ever, takes money without any security process, full of bugs, bad user experience, and user interface!"
Overall positive experience with amazon. I always make sure I read the reviews on items before I order anything.
Change the user interface back this is horrible I'm having more of a difficult time finding things and the flash sales aren't as easy to find anymore this app sucks
This app is buggy and freezes all the time. Not a great experience to use on my phone.
Always had a good experience with Amazon. My order should have been delivered 8pm yesterday. Still not received.
Fairly easy to navigate. Have had a great online shopping experience everytime I've used this.
Best shopping experience ever. Prices usually far lower than anywhere else and customer service is phenomenal.
This application doesn't work on your orders page. It just says something gone wrong eveytime. ruins your experience with this app.
Very bad experience from morning I am trying to order.. but the dog say UH- OH something went wrong at our end.. What is that went wrong and when it will be corrected... Horrible... Solve the issue ASAP
"They want access to my camera so much that I can't review by just upload the pictures already taken, n videos are also limited, Amazon is just way too greedy to control your personal devices n experience"
Worest app ever I used I put one order and I paid payment also 1st it shows your order will delivered with in four days but I check after 4 days it was showing your order will be delivered after 23 days I was shocked worest experience ever
"This app worked well years ago, but the continual added complexities and changes have make it a glitchy trash experience on my phone (pixel 3a)"
"Excellent shopping experience! I can find things on Amazon that I just can't get anywhere else and at a decent price, too."
Very irresponsible delivery guy's. They come out of delivery time and threatening us to take it or they will drop it at the door steps!! Worst experience ever!
"I've never had a bad experience, I had a frustrating one once but customer support handled it well."
"I really did not even imagine that Amazon India is so bad. I had a worst experience this time in India. Amazon India is a cheater and looks like they earn money by delivering wrong products and when you complain them back, they are even not bothered to reply...I ordered for Chafful mushroom cream but they delivered Sunisa brand and when I opened the box there was no cream inside....was shocked to see that. I even posted a message on Amazon app to replace the product but nobody turned back."
"Souq was much better. The deals suck, prices are expensive and the interface is complicated"
The new app interface is harder to use and slower. Please revert to the previous design.
"I love the Amazon app, I've only had a very good experience with Amazon even if I had to return some items, which is not very often."
"I got locked out of my account which had a gift card on it. Customer service agent Olga R. unredeemed my gift card to move it to a new account and never recovered it. Amazon customer service is the worst. After politely telling customer service agents what happened, they would hang up on me when I asked for a supervisor. Probably the worst customer service experience ever."
"Amazon is not to good, I ordered a 45$ dollar product and it got lost and might not even get here, I already also had to wait a week, not the best experience with Amazon"
"The filter section is useless, unable to multi select an option. Worst experience"
In my personal experience. Everything that Amazon prime has to offer. There's is no value. I honestly have nothing good to say. All the services are bad and misleading.
"New interface has it's ups and downs, IMO acess to my wishlists need to be quicker."
"Why are you hiding the chat button?!? My flow of getting chat support: 1. Open google chrome 2. Search for amazon chat 3. Click on the 1st result that says amazon chat 4. Open chat 8n the amazon app Really great user experience amazon. 🤕🖕 Please hire a product designer and fix it. Also you have a keyboard bug on Android. It covering the input field while typing, so is no way of seeing what I'm typing."
Very bad experience. I've used is 2 times and both the time order got delayed by minimum 2-3 days and customer representative don't even care about it as they disconnect the call when you ask them to raise complaint about the same. Pathetic experience.
"Bad experience with customer service, Don't get Amazon Prime.. they will charge you when you didn't even ask for it."
Best shopping experience i ever had. Easy to locate what i need and prices are hard to beat. Cut and dry what is most important to you?
Bad experience one of my order was lost and another one of my order wasn't the correct amount of product my order was shipped through aoruisier I never order from them again
I'm very disappointed..I spent Long time trying to remove one address without any success!! Taking me to links not working ..and pages says error and redirect to home page...this too bad experience..this not the way it should be
My last shopping experience was awesome. I placed an order and couldn't believe the next day was in my hands!!!
Very bad experience I ordered something I don't like and when I put it on refund they said that refund will be initiated within 3-5 days but now it's been month haven't got information.
it's a beautiful experience shopping from Amazon but delivery in not sure about when they drop off they don't deliver to your door they just dropped your hundred dollars products any place any where no regard for you money n time for shopping from they stores plz do better job
hitting next at the end of the page rather than items auto uploading is annoying. Noon has a better experience really
Map is never available. So the delivery day I must stay at home until delivery arrives because I never know how far it is. One of the worst logistics experience ever
"I always have great experience shopping on Amazon. You can buy almost everything, and most of the products are delivered within 48 hours or less."
"Good app for Amazon Shopping and account features. Tends to freeze up on occasion but smooth experience overall. Recommend, DJ Brooklyn Johnny."
Changing color/size takes forever to load. Very frustrating experience.
"For the most part, my experience has been great. I buy a lot from Amazon and return very little. They always have what I need."
One of the bests digital market. With easy interface and very fast delivering products!
"The Most horrible online shopping experience I've ever had, false emails about delivery time, no follow up, unprofessional customer care, literally useless, when i call to ask why my order hasn't been delivered yet they just tell me it's delayed to next day because of internal problem after waiting from 9 a.m to 9 p.m., they have no respect for their customers, they Never call back even when they say they will, Never shop through Amazon Egypt ever again."
Horrible customer service experience. When they started I received the merchandise in 3 days. Now 10 days or more. That supposed to improve.
I have never been to a Amazon Store or ordered anything from Amazon.. So I have no prior experience with this particular issue..
Fantastic place to shop and has some of the best brands sold at incredible prices. Definitely a great experience and very addictive.
Never had I more trouble logging out of anything in my whole life. Absolutely nerv wracking experience everytime I use this app. Would not recommend. I ll listen to dota basshunter now to cool off.
My experience haven't been that good because I thought I could pick an outfit find out what's the cost spend the wheel and find out what's the cost and see what specials are available thank you
"Cant delete the app as its appararently an android system app, just makes me hate amazon more. I will never recommend it and will actively avoid it due to ruining my moatly stock android experience."
Amazon shopping used to be an enjoyable experience until you guys started using USPS to deliver your packages now my last three packages came over a week late I do not trust USPS to deliver my stuff on time and intact I'm not sure why you guys started using USPS maybe to save money but it's garbage
"Best shopping experience and custoner service every, WoW Absolutely fantastic. Thank you Amazon for all those lovely items delivered the same day. Dont know how you do it"
"I mean... no reason 2 install. Unless u want alexa to shop with, and a light blue themed shopping experience. A waste of storage did I mention it's like 8 mb?!"
"Horrible user interface, products aren't as cheap as you think. And there so many other sites out there that do it much better!"
Still one star for the horrifyingly rude and inexperienced staff and supervisors. Also for trying to charge one of my cards without permission.
"very... very.... horrible experience. ordered product on monday, recieved it Wednesdays... all the product was damaged and tampered with. everytime i called customer service they hung up on me.... even the supervisors. then after telling me they know its their fault, they can not help me. now im out of hundreds of dollars and a bunch of faulty worthless product. they even went as low as telling me theyll give me 20$ to keep it.... no!!!!! i want the product i ordered, or ALL my money refunded...."
Amazon is the best online shopping I'd experienced and would recomended.I am a member for years and never have any issue that never resolved.I would always recomend them for averyone.KEEP UP THE GOOD SERVICE AMAZON!!!
Very frustrating experience with the constant crashing and items not being deliverable or can't be delivered toy area.
"I know some people have their doubts? but me Their is No doubt Amazon is the best Shopping experience I've experienced, Love it.shop atleast once a week if I need anything..they have it..thanks Amazon."
Amazon makes life easier for finding most items on this app. In most cases and recent experience is excellent including customer service being helpful to customer's queries.
App was working fine but now viewing the app has the worst lagging interface I have ever used. It has been like this for me even before the holidays
Daraz and aliexpress has better looking interface than this. Looks like it was made in 2012 and then never updated it.
"Old style was much better,I tend to find much better shopping experience before.think I may leave altogether, too many bugs also"
"I have had nothing but very good experiences with Amazon shopping. Delivered on time, great condition."
Too long to mention...let me just congrats amazon for being one and 2nd to worlds integrated retail store that there is! Pls make this a fun experience to me again ...bye for now..
"Very bad experience with different orders, promises without take action and following up the client requests, for last order they bring it damaged and still 5 days without return and refund the money also when I call them again today the person who pick up my call start laughing on me. Thank you Amazon UAE for the very bad experience and services."
Always a great experience with Amazon Shopping. Easy to find items and great prices.
"Can't contact a person, just get a virtual assistant, very poor experience. The amount of money they are taking too."
Easy and efficient. My experiences with Amazon overall are excellent.
Horrible experience with Amazon... there service has significantly gone down... i can see them loosing their leadership position very soon.... horrible care expereince.... now we are simply wasting time putting orders which are not going to be delivered! :(
Can't change shipping address from app? It keeps resetting itself without anything else. Otherwise fine experience.
Use this all the time but the fairly recent change to filtering is ridiculous and takes time to filter. Pls change it as it ruins experience.
always have a good experience with Amazon. Most orders are on time as expected with my Prime account.
"positive experience, even when things go wrong, customer support is excellent and they handle things right away."
"You gotta love the people who blame their illiteracy and stupidity on an app developer. This app does exactly what it purports to do, with a clean interface and intuitive UI. There are no bugs, instabilities or flaws within this app's code. So if you gave this app 1, 2 or even 3 stars, then you are either too dumb to use it or you are a complete a-hole. And your mom copulates with mules."
I can't leave the house so it's my birthday I bought a whole bunch of things as in like 10 itemsnothing too serious but literally everything I got was either damaged to small or nothing like the picture this is just my experience then it took forever to get my refund no worth the wait
I have really bad experience on Amazon because the day I try to buy some my account was logged out and I didn't not get back they kept lying to me every time asking for some receipt 🧾 that 2 week who keeps a receipt for 2 week and that's how I lose my money to this scammers
One of the best online shopping services I have ever seen. App is very easy to use too. Totally good experience for a customer.
Sometimes the packages aren't on time but it's good shopping experience 🙂 Amazon is one of my best friends. #2DayShipping
Not recommened at all..i had worst experience with my recent purchase of tv..amazon has secret policy that for some products we need to verify product before delivery boy and only accept it..if u dont check and accept delivery and then realize something wrong with product amazon customer care says they r not responsible..also most of customer care executives dont giv proper suport or solution to our concerns...even amazon not approve ur reviews in their app for their bad service..ban amazon
"Excellent customer service, superior selection, and competitive prices! What more could one ask from an online shopping experience!"
Great shopping experience. But I will only give 5 stars to apps that give the ability to have dark mode in their apps. Please add dark mode to your app.
"At this point in time I'm not too ""Happy""!!!!💉🦷👎👎 Your user interface is not performming right. I have to restart my computer to make it work!!🦷👎. Not a good experience. I don't know what's wrong with it,but it needs to be fixed!!"
I've had some issues but my experience is satisfactory I have placed an order for some stuff but I found it in a speciality store close by my house and it's more convenient for me to pay in cash
Great shopping experience. You're assured to find what you want at a decent price; unlike shopping locally.
Bad delivery experience I booked one flight ticket for tomorrow and they did not deliver my order till now despite my order supposed to be delivered yesterday. Thanks Amazon for this delay I will never deal with you any more.
Amazon told me to write a review so here it is I use it for almost everything I love the interface an the user friendly app I highly recommend the app and amazon prime the benefits are Worth it
Come on. Disappointed to see a web based app for such a big company. Even look at the user interface. Looks like developed by a part time freelancer. Spend some money for a native app.
"The worst experience I have ever had in my life. The item i ordered was very delay and when I called them they kept telling me on the way and that was for 4 days, at the end I called them and they told me the item lost."
Interface is awful slow and takes a while to load most of the time it's a blank white screen
My experience shaping in Amazon is very great . it's the best.what ever they show or they sell on line it's hundred percent true .and fast delivery and best price and best quality.
I have always had good experiences with my Amazon app! Great shipping and packaging every time!!!!
New interface is horrible. Less efficient and more congested than previous.
"The shopping experience is fine, actually getting my packages lately seems to be a problem. I address a package to our mailroom entrance it disappears. I address it to my work address with instructions to hand it to a store clerk and it gets delivered next door to the resident address instead which I do jot have keys for. I adpdress it to my home's entrance, my neighbor locks the outer door, it gets delivered to the outside stoop and delivery prrson doesnt knock, it gets stolen off the stoop."
"Fast shipping, great customer service and experience!! Also reasonable prices and a variety of different types of needs."
"Poor interface, clunky overall. Easily navigable but feels like an Android app from 2014"
My Experience with Amazon has been amazing & Understanding...I purchased some items & didn't need them anymore because me & my Daughter Mother had an misunderstanding they refunded my funds back into my account with no problem once they were returned...May God Bless them😇
Amazon! This is so silly and it's driving me crazy. You are among the richest men in the world and your company makes billions yet you have the worst and silly user friendly app and website in the entire world. I'm honestly appalled I never write reviews but for you I had to. Your application and website looks like it was made in 1977 by 2 teenagers who had only 1 week experience of coding and graphic design. Its extremely poor. Please work on this. Its very bad and I think many people agree.
My experience so far have been very good. great costumer service. Their reply is very fast and always satisfactory.
"Ordered a 650ml shampoo from Amazon pantry, there is no proper packing!! One forth was leaked while in delivery!! There is no option to return in Amazon Pantry!! Careful while ordering these!! Another bad experience. Ordered 300 gloves and just delivered 150! There is no option to replace nothing!"
I have been with Amazon for a very long time and I've experienced nothing less than improvement from the beginning! AMAZING COMPANY!
"One of the worst apps, and customer service experiences ever. The reps just don't know what there doing, I'll just go buy stuff off of ebay or something."
The new interface is awful. The old one worked fine but even if it didn't it seems like anything would be an improvement over this.
It's a great app I use it alot its secure and its fast and easy to navigate through which makes for a pleasant shopping experience
The app has become painfully slow since the last few updates. Ever since they introduced a new Profile page experience
"Everyone knows that Amzon is the top online shopping experience I love this App above all. The only thing I dislike about Amazon, I have been playing the giveaways for a long time to never win ever"
"Somehow, amazon turned our experience to Spanish. We don't speak nor understand Spanish! We can't even find controls to switch to English because they are all in Spanish. Help, who can we call?"
very bad new interface app and even website. hard to change billing address and visa. very confusing interface very awful
Most convenient shopping experience ever!!! Always find everything I am looking for and so much more!!! I looove Amazon! 🙂
"Always a great experience! They have never ever let me down. Best online shopping company ever hands down. Thank you amazon, I love you!!!!"
Love the easy ordering and returning process. I have never had a bad experience in the last 5 plus years.
Really bad experience with Amazon shopping returned damaged item ad per their suggestion to be refunded. Altgough item was returned did not get refunded. Pay atyention with Amazon Customer Service Mafia
"- Bad Experience. - Poor customer services. - Bad packaging. - Orders Cancelled without logical reasons. - Orders divided into multi-orders without clear reasons. - More lies and deceit. I will gonna to cancel my ""Prime"" membership and remove the app."
"Always had great experience with amazon, easy site to buy off, and updates on your items, with a track your product 👍"
Umm....this new interface is horrible. It's like going from playing the latest version of Doom to playing the original Doom... graphically speaking.
Terrible update to navigation experience. Additonal touches to perform previously intuitive actions.
"The Amazon UAE experience is very clunky. Keeps changing the address, and keeps refreshing for no reason."
i have good experience with amazon deliverys on time easy to ordet returns r good but i have been happy with all my orders never returned anythink thank u Amazon i have been pleased with all my orders over I write Amazon with very high score thank you
Last 2 purchase experience has been terrible with items not delivered . Understand the COvID impact but Amazon's only solution is Contact Seller which is not quite appropriate.
I like the interface but it's very slow and unresponsible. Almost unusable.
amazon has to be the greatest shopping experience ever its just fanaminal they can get everthing you could imagine in a short period of time and hats off to the costermer service
Bought a gift card than got locked out my account by amazon it's been more than 24 hours still can't enter my account still haven't received my gift card online. Worst service ever experienced
"My experience here is at an all time low. My orders got canceled and I didn't find out until the days they were supposed to arrive. So thanks, Amazon. You know how to piss on and disappoint folk😕"
Amazon is a very bad experience for me they lock my Mom's account since 4 months and I just create one 3 days ago they locked it up to when you call them they don't take it seriously 🤧🤧😒👎👎👎and I have up to 200$ in my gift card so I guess I lost everything.😪😪
"Tries to take over from the website and fails. Awful user interface. If I wanted to use the app, I would use the app."
Not happy with my recent purchase and customer service . Order was robbed by the driver and all customer service can tell me is we will refund you. If my money is what I needed I wouldn't have made the purchase common sense . Over all garbage. I would have never known if it wasn't for my child hearing the door when I specifically said to call me upon arrival. This is the worst experience ever. Truly disappointed in this
"Latest update experience makes you shop at Walmart ....it also got slow.... Update, it got better, I guess it took a while to populate the servers after the app updates"
"It is being the most frustating app that I have used in my life.They have made me wait weeks and I am still waiting there deliveres are never on time ,they are so full of excuses...It is difficult for me to say this because I am really a positive person . I think I would just give my money away to them because they dont even seme to pay.As an actress I am always in need of a good selling company but honestly speaking I will not recommend this app naither to my worst enemy.Just my experience💧"
Mostly good experiences but with Covid now rampant 2 day delivery is non existent. Product selection is good and mostly accurate.
a wonderful shopping experience. Easy to find what you want and incredible xustomer service makes it a wonderful experience every time
"always a great experience. the 1 time my delivery got damaged, the customer service bot had credited my account within minutes. super easy experience"
search bar moved from top to bottom with no way to change it back. stupid idea and interface.
Bad experience!!!! I have order here and paid by card and not deliver yet almost 3months already!!! And when i check its written there shipped already since june!!!!!
Always a great experience once my packages were sent to my old address I thought I'd have to go get them from strangers who might off denied they had them I was afraid but Amazon sent me my orders again to my real address no charge no questions asked thank you
Repeatedly experience technical issues. Completely deleted all of my payment methods and now my Amazon Prime Chase card points will not sync with my Amazon prime account.
Great shopping a few glitches that could make it better however much rather purchase with them than get ripped off else where just speaking about my own experiences
they have everything shipping is fast shipping is free when you have time they just tend to your needs I love this place it's like the the greatest shopping experience ever
"I gotta agree. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. The ""new"" interface is less intuitive and clunkier than the old one"
It's a Good App but I don't need it anymore - No idea how to delete my account? It's near impossible to delete it from my experience ;/
"Love Amazon! I have yet to have a bad experience with any of the reps. They are very courteous, friendly and knowledgeable. I'm gonna remain an Amazon Prime member."
"Very bad grocery experience, waited for more than 7hours and then got notification that my order has been canceled. Better! will not risk during Ramada."
"I have never once had to wait longer than 5 minutes after the initial automated prompting to speak to an Amazon Customer service agent. Perfect, professional, courteous, knowledgeable and Oh so patient. The best customer service agents in the industry. You may be doubting my review. If so, please find out for yourself. Give Amazon customer service agents a try. They will not disappoint. You might just stay with Amazon because of the customer service experience alone."
"Seriously, what is the deal with this next button to see more items nonsense? The infinite scoll was a much better experience."
"Easy to navigate, and secure transactions make for a pleasant shopping experience."
Items always late delivery. Return process is very disappointing. Doesnt compare to what noob provides in this market. Worst online experience with this giant.
Love it! Has everything I need and more! Thanks Amazon. You are the best shopping experience I have ever had online. Bravo!
"Hate the new update. Ruined my shopping experience, so I will go elsewhere. If it ain't broke don't fix it... Or in this case.. Break it!! Whoever let this new update go ahead should be fired!!"
"Amazon shopping experience has been disastrous as of recent, management chose to ignore complaints, concerns never got answered or resolved. I'd be cautious before buying anything to avoid hassles and harassments. What a shame!"
Amazon is always my first choice. Great prices and excellent service. I've never had a bad Amazon experience.
"The experience is always a pleasure!! Allot like Walmart, except: Amazon has EVERYTHING you can dream up, and you don't feel so dirty and ashamed when you're done shopping....."
omg I'm really loving Amazon! I freaking love all the people who work for amazon!💜💜 I love the experience❤ thanks for taking care of my orders and making sure it's secure
The app works. It does not obey dark mode setting. The user interface is mediocre. No tablet layout...
Good experience until account got locked out. Amazon is days overdue having supposed to been fixed the issue already. Not sure what the hold up is.... Fix immediately!
I have a horrible experience with this app. Locked two of my accounts. One with funds left in it. Absolutely disgusting.
Amazon is my go to app I love shopping on Amazon I love the prime free shipping I only had wonderful experiences with them Delivery is fast and always on time I highly recommend Amazon
"Unprofessional couriers and useless customer support that cannot even help me reorder the same order cancelled by a courier, the worst online purchase experience i have ever had."
Just downloaded the apps and it crushed several times...awful experience...I will uninstall it and go back to the old fashioned website on browser...
I can't select English unless I live in an English speaking country. Makes this app useless for a foreigner living in Sweden. Terrible experience
"Very very very bad experience, the shipment was send to wrong address, and after that no one know where is the shippment!!! Customer service keep giving promises to solve it. After 5 days not solved a d more promises!"
It has been a GREAT shopping experience every time! I get exactly what I ordered and when (if not earlier) they say it will be on my doorstep.
"Great user experience, especially with Prime Membership. Some of the greatest Customer Service I've ever experienced."
It keeps changing to French no matter what! Worst experience 😪 . Remove the update and everything is fine!
Pretty convenient lay out for a mobile app. Usually apps offer so much less I dont bother but this has been a pleasant experience.
I'm a Prime member but the delivery is not on-time ALWAYS (as per the given schedule of delivery)! I have a bad experience again today. And the courier is like a boss!
Always looking to help the customer never have had a bad experience. Always looking help with a bad purchase therefore I look at it as a company that is looking to help
Great experience and I'm finally glad that I'm starting to use the app for shopping makes life just a little bit more convenient and easier when necessary👍😏
"Great shopping experiences for many years now. I use ""Smile"" to aid animals in need while I shop. Very fast even now at Christmas."
Amazon is my first place that I have tried baying stuff. Customer service is awesome..will always be a customer. Thank you Amazon. Best experience ever..
Amazon Egypt is the worst online shopping experience anyone could get ever!!
"Very good for a shopping experience, also their not too pushy,which I love.ive moved home recently and had good service from the suppliers."
I've had a terrible experience with Amazon. Anyone is buying from them should know that they do not have your back like they declare. The app itself has limited capabilities.
Good for the online shopping experience. Not so good at making door step deliveries.. sometimes.
The worst possible experience while trying to confirm my identity for online purchases! Just uninstall the app and be done with it.
This new interface is clunky and stupid. A LOT of animated screens after every action.
The worst experience ever everything about the app is bad. False info about products. Bad delivery experience. Just really bad
AMAZON HAVE BEEN MY NUMBER ONE GO TO IN THIS HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE WE ARE ALL GOING THROUGH AT THIS TIME...I AM CURRENTLY A PRIME MEMBER.. AND I'M GIVING FIVE STARS TRULY I AM NOT THE EASIEST PERSON TO SATISFY I'M KIND OF PICKY FRESH DEPARTMENT EXCELLENT .. ANY OTHER PRODUCT THAT I HAVE RECEIVED IF I DIDN'T LIKE IT I SEND IT BACK WITH NO PROBLEM THEY EXECUTE REFUNDING THE MONEY WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT THANK YOU AMAZON.... ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐.
This app is very clunky and inconstent. It feel like im using the web browser instead of an application. Just a lousy experience
"I literally just got off the phone with the best customer service I have ever experienced. I had some issues with my account, and they crushed it. I have never been so satisfied!!"
"Best possible customer experience in ordering, delivery and customer support currently available in North America. Good job guys."
"Painful user experience, especially when there's some ongoing deals, the steps to getting the discounts are not intuitive and accessible. And Black friday and cyber Monday sales are just hype. For non-IT stuffs, i dont see much deals. A BIG FAT MEH. u r losing your market share in Asia, that's for sure"
I haven't had a bad experience yet. The one time my packages didn't arrive I was refunded everything about 24hrs after letting them know.
Why fix what ain't broken? Please can we revert back to the old UI interface. I never had any problems with the old layout.
Bad user experience. A lot of things such as cancelling membership are too confusing or require too many clicks
"In the end my experience,I expect to find confidence in trusting Amazon to provide me and my life style,.,... More importantly in reality I won't be giving any more business to Amazon."
"I love you using Amazon shopping I've never had any bad experiences until recently, it may be just a hiccup but they lost my order and I'm just going to wait for it because it was such an awesome deal it is what it is. But I hope it gets here before Christmas cuz it's my daughter's Christmas present. God bless Merry Christmas Pastor Wanda Gutierrez"
"Bought from Amazon after a long time away from it and using eBay. Thought I'd try it out and see what's changed. Nothing. Another bad experience. I bought an item and if I took out a Prime trial, I'd get free next day delivery. Following day came and nothing! After 3 days I start a chat with customer service. He said don't worry, it will be with you then. So I kindly told him that the date he said was 3 days ago. Got to laugh. Got to say I won't use Amazon again! 😡 Idiotic to say the least."
Good experience just don't order jewelry. It loses the fake gold quickly and turns black. The shirts fit good. Ring turned my finger black
Amazon services are amazing and awesome. Because we are order any products in Amazon it is 💯% guarantee they are delivering that product. again Amazon is amazing..... With my experience ☺️
I have always had a great experience when dealing with Amazon. Very fast on delivery.
Worst delivery drivers I've ever experienced. They keep delivering my packages to random places and taking fraudulent pictures so I never received my products. This has happened twice now
It's been an absolute positive experience for me and I really love shopping there pretty much more than any place else and that's pretty much the truth pretty much LOL no doubt for real
"Dear all people don't buy to Amazon because he cheating to order if you order any thing items but he will send different items because I'm I'm purchased I have experience there are all fourad cheaters this app not good, 1 star bad app..."
"I had a nice experience with Amazon actually, it comes with everything you might need! Furniture, clothes, appliances and more!"
The new interface is terrible. Very unclear and loads forever. Completely deters me from buying anything. Why did you mess with what was good?
Barely working. Have to tap multiple times to get anything to happen. Frustrating shopping experience
I've never had a problem with Amazon as a company OR the App! an overall phenomenally easy experience EVERY time!
I ordered a product and received a different product. I put up two reviews and both were taken down with no refund. It was an unfortunate experience
"I wish there was lower rate than 1 star. If u r not capable of delivering a service, u shouldn't offer it from the beginning.. I ordered a simple order and was promised as a prim mmbr to receive it the next day and 3 days passed and no thing happened. Eventually someone called and said he was from Ajman amazon station and he said there is a problem with the system then I asked for his name he refused to give it and hanged the line to my face, called ur support and no help. Worst experience ever."
"Isn't personal experience, however, order had to be cancelled & reordered.....after waiting month already....at this rate this person should get products ordered free & total refund of products and shipping."
It doesn't match the desktop experience and there is no way to contribute to smile Amazon when using the app.
"works great, app never crashes or freezes and very easy to use interface ."
"it's a good experience with Amazon but I wanted to write some product reviews but the eligibility is to spend more than $50,which is too much. Amazon please help me, I want to write product reviews but $50 is too much, you should low the price or remove the price."
Horrible customer service experience they offered little to no help with shipping matters and issues and even the supervisor wasn't much help.
"Downloaded app trying to get help with my awful kindle experience,,seems amazon would rather waste my time than take my money and actually deliver content or working products"
"Bad Customer Experience ... The App itself is good, but the shipping, tracking and products availability is bad comparing with Souq KSA before!"
"Top shopping app, can't go wrong on amazon. Best online shopping experience ever."
"Very bad experience with prime and delivery from amazon, 2 days passed from the delivery time and still didn't get my order delivered even when i waited all day as the customer service said it will be delivered by 9 pm , unprofessional handling for the time and delivery even after several attempts to locate my package."
"Here in Egypt, Amazon is the best of the best shopping apps; the most beautiful and interesting experience and interesting treatments and amazing discounts no doubt Amazon is the best #5stars"
"You ask for it .My experience with you is not very good. I play games , got over 2,000.00 on a game. How do I get a card? My daoughter said you should of sent me one . I stoped playing a lot of games,"
Why was the interface changed? People at Amazon who do this is being paid to much. They suck at there job and those that recommended it should be fired.
I prefer the previous app before the last update. because it was more easily to use. even the interface it was better . Thank you
One of the best shopping experience you will ever get
"Very nice with good interface, even when you typed the wrong keyword for search it rephrase n give u what want! Lovely"
With each new update the interface becomes more chaotic and less intuitive.
"Worst application i ever have experienced, Delivering stones worth 90thousand instead of ipad, worst application, Must uninstall this fake application, i have experienced this app, must uninstall this otherwise it will deliver jeans or shirts instead of 1lakh iphones."
"User interface seems to be going downhill, where is the tracking information nation now it was previously previously right out in front of you ......can't find it"
"2FA Nightmare Good luck recovering your account if you lose access to the 2FA app for two step authentication. Customer service is non existent. You are left locked out of your own account where you have your card details, purchase history, item warranties and so on. It's been an awful experience, not to mention that the research tool behaves as if designed by people living in a faraway galaxy that have no idea of people here on Earth as you never get the results you intended."
My experience with Amazon in general have been a blast. Seriously they've been more than we expected. Rock on Amazon:)
The experience with amazon is the best. some are good deals is just to shop for the best items
Worst experience when dealing with customer service! They advertise one delivery date and then they change it once your order is placed!
Love Amazon! Having Prime is the only way to go. Never had a bad experience with the app or Amazon!
Generally very easy and intuitive to use. No obvious flaws or issues experienced during use.
Kind of a clunky interface and what is the Notification I keep getting? Click bait of some to keep me checking the app to see ads?
Great experience as always. My disability does not allow me to go outside and Amazon has my best friend for the last 2 years.
"great app, ive never had a problem with it. Amazon puts out a great shopping experience."
"Only got a few thing from here but been great experiences. Just wish they would bring to back door, alley access. We have a lot of dumb thief."
awesome experience! simple and authentic.no one can beat Amazon not even Walmart. best prices and customer centric. my life time bestie and one stop destination
What can I say Amazon has perfected the e-commerce shopping experience. I just hate that is taken away retail brick-and-mortar stores.
"Clunky interface, even simple things like doing a return are made difficult."
Worst online shopping experience I've EVER had with even worse customer service! Cancelled my membership after first purchase and only had this app for 4 days!
"Worst experience, waiting for product eagerly, simply sending SMS saying product will be delivered in few more days or refund. I dont know what type of support is this."
"I don’t use it so often, as it’s not a very convenient interface, everything is very complicated. Much is not clear, as it did not grow together with me."
I'm so frustrated I ordered something and they delivered me a wrong one and I contacted amazon and returned the stuff and since 2 weeks I'm waiting for my refund when I called the Amazon buyer he says that he refund and he ask me to contact amazon yes I followed him and I did email amazon and they said the money has been refunded already so it has been refunded to whom and after I called the amazon seller he said he refund the money contact Amazon Very bad experience Good customer service Amazon
"Hopeless experience , poor quality products and absolutely hopeless delivery service..rude delivery guys messing up with delivery schedule everyday..worst experience ever ..will suggest to use other online purchase sites instead of amazon"
I have peace of mind in my shopping experience. Love that the customer is key!! Blessings Amazon crew especially quality control!
This is the bad experience ever with Amazon.. i want to buy redmi note 8 pro with exchange Samsung j7 prime. same day offer is showing but after some time my handset Samsung j7 prime not showing in list..and executive said this offer not vaild for your handset and we are not able to help in this.
App has gotten to work more smoother as updates have been applied. This is to my phone model and my experience.
"The Whole Foods section of the Amazon Shopping app is ridiculous. Seriously, who is the UI designer here? Horizontal scroll and crammed content. Such a disappointing experience."
The best experience buying online. Never has problems with it. always in time.
Amazon UAE user interface is so poorly designer compared to Souq which was well refined. It is quite a step backward.
Amazon has made shopping during this time of uncertainty. A good experience with timely deliveries.
"Very bad experience with this app I ordered something, I'm tracking my shipment its showing out for delivary but without any notice,call they cancelled why??"
Good but the only problem with my experience was that I had problem with my deliveries. It may have been because of the fact that it was Christmas time. Other than that it was very good.
Worst experience ever never going back waste of money. 14 calls and hours wasted on the same items I've been trying to get for 2 weeks
"Unable to. Map Amazon upi with phone sms. It send around 10 sms and still not able to. Map the bank, worst experience with Amazon pay upi. I lost around 15 rs"
I always have a wonderful experience with amazon they are always on time and friendly and you can tell thy care. Thank you Amazon❤❤
Perfect but please add better user interface by making all the squares in the app have rounded corners to add better ui
I love to buy gifts from Amazon... no other way to buy and send to others. makes gift giving a whole new experience.
Amazon is a great shopping experience I'm a senior and handicapped and it works very well for good job keep it
Bad interface and incompetent employees make Amazon a pain. They get almost every order wrong. Shocking that such a large company makes so many mistakes.
took a few minutes to get use to the new app. but clean interface mode open look.
actually it was the most bad experience with them they stoll 75euro from my balance and after 20 days contact them and email them .. no one is responsible just want your money in any tricks..
My experience with Amazon was not the best. Amazon keeps declining my account and i can't buy nothing because than Amazon will delete my account
Great!! Loved the products. It really is a great way to shop. I am never going to shop any other way from now on. Thank's Amazon for a great experience.
"convenient, easy user interface, and good prices. hard to beat it."
the experience I've had online with Amazon is great. love the prices and that it gives you the date of arrival time. love it💖💞🤗🤗🤗
"Very bad experience with a book purchase, not delivered and not returned money more than 2months now. Very poor and no proper response from customer service"
Filters never work correctly. Finding a link to customer service is a joke. They don't care about the customer experience. Just make Jeff richer.
Scammers no trust this app any more ... they send you wrong items in purpose and they Delayed your refund more than 30days Amazon is just a scam this is my experience with it
Terrible shopping experience at Amazon. The give you the highest prices. There are better places to shop.
Outstanding experience when using the application. I highly recommend the application. Technical Support is excellent.
it is rare to have an issue with Amazon Prime. so hard to say how the whole experience works but I am very impressed
"I've had great experiences with this app. Even when packages are late, am refunded in a timely manner."
It's a very handy app. I use it very regularly and the purchasing experience is very convenient.
"I've used amazon for over 20yrs and am 99% happy with them, more than any app or shopping experience."
I order 1 product on 7/8/2019 but till product is not delivered and the payment which was i made is prepared so my money is just simply wasted . Very bad experience with Amazon😣
I love amazon its a great app and website i recommend everyone to buy from this store i have experienced no issues with this app just some edvice dont pay for prime if u dont buy lots of stuff from here
"It is a horrible experience..they sell fake products claiming they are original, they never refund you in case you discover their dishonesty although they got back the product...I never recommend dealing with this app"
"Since souq turned their name to amazon, I really had a bad experience in too many points that i can't just write it, everything is horrible!"
Horrible experience and customer service with my baby registry and Amazon locker. I will definitely never use their service again and will not recommend it to anyone!
I can't make a fake acct like suggested by customer service. And can't log in to purchase nothing. I forgot my password. Moved to a new state and done nothing wrong to need a fake acct. My experience is not good
"The company, despite its significant financial resources, has been slow to innovate and its mobile application lacks the expected level of quality and user experience."
All my experiences have been good ones. I have bought about 100 items and had as many as 3 or 4 deliveries a day. Even during Christmas
Terrible app. Doesn't even open over half the time. Horrendous user interface. Please hire a better ui/ux team.. you have the money for it
My experience is fantastic but I can't update your app. Can you please advice. Thank you.. I can't update your app. Please help.
"Very bad experience and no way to approach customer care. Amazon team is very irresponsible in handling the shipment, without contacting customer they reject the delivery. Waste of moeny and waste of time."
Amazon prime is amazing! I've had only great experience with Amazon! Must have! Try it out and you will never use any app except Amazon!
Awful delivery experience. Horrible refund policy.
so far my experience has been great I have had my package arrive a day late besides that my packages always come on time and I will continue to order from them.
always have great experience with Amazon
This shopping app needs no introduction. The magnificent amazon. The best of best and nothing but positive experience. Thank you
Been shopping with Amazon for a while now. And I've had nothing but great experience's shopping with them.
"Best shopping experience ever, extremely great shipping, great return policies, great member benefits I will always use Amazon Shopping I highly recommend using Amazon Shopping A++"
"App is fine, however theyhave horrible shipping methods. They will leave your package anywhere. Worst experience yet by far..."
"The best online delivery and shopping experience, hands down. Any problems are resolved efficiently and quickly."
I buy amazon in its very very bad experience of delivery because I was order 2 month before on delivery day amazon send msg it's delivered but we didn't received after 14 days refund my money. ... now 29th July 2019 2 products again I received from amazon delivered but still we not received then I complaint again she said wait 48 hrs after 48 hours other representative will say wait for 5 day... it's very rubbish from amazon side
"Awful customer service, awful prime experience. My prime order took 3 weeks and it's not yet delivered and nobody have an answer why/when/where about my order"
Bad user experience during login to account
Genuinely best shopping experience I ever had! Shipping speed is 🚀 fast! Good prices and quality & unique products!
"Kind of a slow interface, sometimes I have trouble getting to whole food qr code. Ut it gets the job done"
"Won't open without a full screen advert for rings of power, I pay for prime I do not expect my experience to be ad supported!"
Always a positive experience & I've been a Prime member since the year 2000 & I'm trying to remember if I've ever had a bad experience with Amazon & I cannot.
amazon is a great way to shop and its most of the time on point with the time it says your package is gonna arrive ive had no bad experiences with amazon
"It is the worst experience ever I had. My order is shown delivered. But it is not, I am trying to call the customer service they didn't reply. I don't know what to do"
App has totally corrupted interface even after update. Is now unusable it's that bad.
"Good experience so far, for delivery and products. Also good experience with returns."
has its flaws but overall great experience and costumer service. Good quality on the products and great Shipping time as long as you have the prime offer
"amazon really bad experience for me, always failed send the package never on time and always late, Shopee better than amazon"
The user experience has diminished extensively over the years. Shipping/logistics options have grown inconsistent.
Never had such convenience with shopping but best of all is the customer support. Awesome shopping experience!!!
Worst customer service account randomly put on hold can't even get a for sure way to verify the account worse shopping experience ever will not recommend Amazon for anything or to anyone
The app is extremely intuitive and efficient. Spectacular shopping experience.
Worst experience ever credit card charged n item was never shipped..was told i wasnt charged....well my bank says i was...customer service horrible no help Would give -10stars if possible
Not having a way to easily turn off Alexa connectivity really hurts it's user interface score
User interface is very bad and cheap I use this first time my experience with amazon is not good please change UI first
"Always have the best experience when shopping, purchasing and delivery of my items!"
"App keeps freezing up and crashes, making the shopping experience terrible."
Absolutely love Shopping with Amazon apart from one Experience where l didn't Receive my item but got a Refund apart from that every thing that I got from Amazon has been great and good quality.
great shopping experience and prices are affordable and reasonable..and as a Amazon prime member my orders arrives quickly in one or two days in which I am happy
"Amazing as always. If something goes wrong, these guys always make it right! Best shopping experiences ever!"
Hard to have an experience when the app keeps crashing on my phone.
So slow and bloated. At this point its a better experience to just use the mobile browser.
"Worst experience ever, I bought chair and table, first there's no option to ask to deliver them together which made me dissatisfied, then they told me that the table will be delivered tomorrow and the chair is may 15th, I tried to cancel the chair but it cannot be cancelled as in the app it still not showing the delivery date, i called the customer service and they couldn't help, then suddenly I received a notification that I will receive the table today before 9 pm, it's 10 pm now and nothing!!"
"I still enjoy the amazon experience, sometimes the delivery takes more time than expected but still bearable ..."
Very bad experience with new updates. Half the time i see dog and other half is slow.
Been a great experience the app was a little slow to download but probably just my phone. Would recommend for anyone who likes online shopping
My experience has been well also a bit difficult to understand. This Reading is My overall reading.
"I tried multiple times but couldn't install Amazon UAE app. I had good experience with souq, but really disappointed with Amazon.ae."
"Worst shopping experience of my life. Complete rip off. I purchased a macbook pro which the order isn't even available anymore and hasn't been since amazon allowed a ""private seller to sell a defective and broken laptop for $500. And a iphone 8 I never received. Upon contacting customer service I was informed they have no control over private seller so I received a macbook dented, scratched to hell and a shattered screen and no way to fix or replace. I will NEVER NEVER shop on Amazon EVER AGAIN."
"worst shopping experienced I ever had, I am very disappointed with your customer service.how you don't have a contact number for the delivery company !!!!! I will not order from Amazon again ☹️ Thanks God for Noon 🙌🙏🙏🙏🙏"
Great shopping experience
"Very good experiences with items bought, easy to use navigating,yes prompt delivery and excellent customer service."
Best Shopping Experience
Worst customer service ive ever experienced. I was supposed to get my package on the 12th it's now the 21st and I was told I would very a refund and still get my package but they lied and my package was returned to sender so I just sit here like an idiot waiting for a package they were never sending me and won't pull up the recording of the customer service guy lying to me. I'll never use Amazon again and I'm destroying every Amazon package I see on anyone's door step
I always have a great shopping experience at Amazon. The agent's have good bedside manners. Thank you all
"I ordered something I got something different and when I returned it I didn't get my refund back. Worst experience ever, don't use Amazon."
"I buy almost every thing here, always great delivery process, no problem on returns, all around great experience."
Amazon is a great experience but its prime is expensive and honestly the prices are not always the best.
"very convenient and fast, good costumer service and overall a good shopping experience."
Super slow app. SheIn has a better app experience than Amazon. How is that possible? Get it together Amazon!
"I had great experience with amazon India but Amazon canada is worst , if there is issue with delivery they simply clean up by saying that you have to talk to the Delivery partner firm and will not take any responsibility for the customers service . I haven't received my order and amazon is delaying my order literally that adds up no sense ."
Shop all the time. Occasionally something is not what you want and you can send it back. Love the experience
I have had all positive experience with Amazon
"Put it this way. I work for Macy's but have been shopping on Amazon for a lot longer. Overall, it's a better experience."
This app allows you to dig deep and get a real personalized experience. Thanks again and around and around and around we go!!!!
My experience with Amazon has been excellent every time I have ordered from there app. The bestest bestest! Go Amazon for the bestest of online shopping 🛒🛍️
Very slow operation. It's a much better experience using a browser than this app. Why can't such a company as Amazon do this better?
My experience instead of declining has only became better thanks for all the new things you do for all communities like the low income families that receive snap benefits being able to have have their groceries delivered.
"How can the most successful online retailer have one of the worst app user interface formats ever, settings are a pain to locate."
easy shopping interface. can buy almost anything cheaper then anywhere else and delivered ....how can ya argue that
Account was suspended for no reason I called Amazon customer service tens of times and every time no one new how to fix it. Terrible experience.
"My worst experience with a shop... Pre ordered Pixel 7 and they canceled the order after 12 days of waiting (shipped by amazon) due to a ""technical error"". Never pre order things on Amazon"
"For My first experience with Amazon,and they delivered my order to the wrong address and they don't want to give me a refund."
"Amazon shopping is one of the best online shopping platforms, i have a very bad experience with your delivery team and substandard delivery service..."
Up until now I have not had a negative experience. I have always gotten my orders on time and in perfect condition.
Scrolling through this app is the single most frustrating experience I've ever had. What a shoddy job.
List tray has disappeared since last update. This is a step backwards in ease of use and my buying experience. How do I email Jeff Bezos?
the best shopping experience ! I get what I want and comparison shop..to find the deal and products I want..!
Let's see experience description UH OH something went wrong on our end!! Like when is this app gonna get fixed? Seems I should just cancel my subscription and shop elsewhere??
Ive never had a bad experience with amazon!!! I love this app can't ask for a better way to shop online!!!!
"My experience was very bad with amazon i ordered something and it came after 5 days and , the color was wrong it wasn't the thing i ordered so i totally prefer noon"
Easily one of the best shopping experiences on the mobile format. Easy to use and navigate.
"Amazon makes your shopping experience awesome!! I give it thumbs up on everything, excellent products, great customer service, the best return policy!"
easy shopping experience. very user friendly. good app with easy checkout and awesome prime benefits
"The New interface is garbage & is currently not working,Why change something that was working for something that is clearly not now?"
"A tragically bad app from a multi billion dollar juggernaut. Unintuitive interface, bad sorting, bad recommendations."
My experience was extremely frustrating and ridiculous five times kept saying it was updating still did not install in my phone either Google or your app sucks
So far I've had a nightmare of an experience as far as getting my package they used USPS they should have used UPS and it's a weekend so much for prime delivery
"Works reasonably well, though the interface can be quite slow at times."
Please dont buy any electronics from amazon india. Cheaters...I ordered laptop a month ago. Still not delivered and not money refunded. Their customer service is worst. Giving always false information about delivery status.Miserable experience. Dont buy from amazon. i am filing a consumer case soon.
"Pathetic delivery service, kept changing the delivery time now date.... Worst experience ever on Amazon Prime. Extreme disappointment!"
Sponsored ad ruining the shopping experience. No longer able to browse items in a department in mobile app.
"amazing experience. I am a business owner ( builder) and I am now purchasing my finish materials from Amazon as well as my own personal products. just this week I have purchased mirrors , hardware , pot filler, lighting as well as pantry or hygiene products. keep it up Jeff"
"I have been shopping for many years ,I always had great experience and most of the item purchased were great quality"
Great service! A very safe and reliable online shopping experience. The app is user friendly. Really easy to use.
Very outdated interface.. And there's no way set up a default address... Really Amazon?
"I had a bad experience buying a product and I've been trying to write a review for 1 month, but it doesn't accept it. How are we going to help us, between buyers if Amazon doesn't accept reviews? I like to buy only reliable people and no scamers."
"It's sad to say this because there really fair company, but I just moved into a new home and expecting Amazon promise to come true of the beautiful bed they had posted after i baught everything over 500 dollars my last penny's i had there mail carriers could not follow threw, I made calls I did everything i could and still a week later me and my daughter are still sleeping on the floor , I guys old fashion way is still the way to go, I can't say for everyone experience but hope you're is better"
It is my experience Amazon is not user friendly to those with a handicap I have closed my account after many years I now have a sezure disorder and customer service tried to be helpful however Amazon does not in my experience work with a handicap customer very disappointed ☹️
"Worst experience I have had would rate it zero stars but do not have that on your rating list, very bad app. !!!!!!!"
My experience shopping with Amazon has been great and hassle free and I enjoy their services especially their customer service because they were responsive
"I love shopping via Amazon due to the ease, simple shopping experience every time."
My experience right now is very frustrating because when I get on Amazon it is constantly constantly telling me to either close
I've been using this app for years. It's one of the best shopping apps out there. I like the user interface and the way products are grouped.
New interface navigation sucks and is slower than previous version.
Excellent customer service and experience. I get what I want and need with little inconvenience and disruption to my life.
Freezes all the time now. Filtering is horrible. Frustrating experience
"Amazing Experiences with amazon,if i have to make a return for whatever reason you make it easy to do so."
Horrible experience suspended my account and refused to serve me because i didn't want to give them a copy of my credit card bill.had to pay before getting there free trial on Amazon Prime
Amazon is really Great. I was never really a on line shopper until the last year or so usually a great experience
would be good if it was broken up instead of existing as a fully realized monopoly. good app interface
"Terrible user interface, poor search options and limited product range."
"Always had good experiences and order a lot due to disability! Thank you Amazon Team, your hard work is much appreciated!"
Experience would be better if I spoke Spanish. The site keeps switching to Spanish even after I switch it back. WTH?
"Great experience of paying for 3 items and then have it delivered ( or given away) to wrong address, and when you ask for refund they refund 1 item only."
"Excellent experience everytime we shop online, very helpful and we feel totally secure. Thank you so much Amazon"
The worst experience they blocked my refund money without giving me the promotion code in order to redeem it and they is no way to contact them
"No English version for Polish market. Even purely Polish e-commerce Allegro has two versions: English and Polish. What's wrong in adding English interface, especially for foreigners in Poland? And UI is awful."
"The worst shopping experience, got different item, not only refused to return but also deleted my review, and this happened twice. The most deceiving app"
"Whoever decided to ""update"" the UI to appear busy to thier managers should be FIRED. No cart button? Removed UI interface? Everything out or whack? Get this moron FIRED"
good experience so far a little bit disappointing on prime tv. selling and renting really old movies TV was one of the reasons I became a Prime Member.
The worst experience ever.. I purchased £200 worth items and they didn't deliver it ..and they refuse to refund me my money
These days trying to stay at home as much as possible. My go to place for just about anything is Amazon Prime. Never had a bad experience.
"Great app that expedites the purchasing experience, however intermenu navigation could be improved"
"have only had a couple issues, but Amazon always makes it right! love Amazon and all my shopping experiences!"
"Very bad experience with this platform. Orders are late and customer service os very sarcastic, very bad experience."
"Bad experience 😪 navigation not friendly and prices also change without notification , saudi souq is much better"
"Prime membership was a wonderful experience! Never saw something as this orders treatment, drivers behavior, even refunding, it took me less than 5 hours ❤️ Really Amazon Saudi Arabia is taking it faaaaaaar awayyy 🔥🔥👌"
"Updates made the whole experience worse overall, the app is a lot slower than it used to be."
User friendly website. Good selections. Deliveries very timely. Overall good experience. Thanks!
Worst experience in my life. Amazon had cancelled my order without my permission. Worst service. I will not use Amazon ever again. Until they solve my concern
I absolutely love the Amazon app it's great! I've always had a pretty good experience usin this app. I highly recommend this app.
the interface not friendly and promotions not work on Amazon App. I am going to uninstall it.
The mobile app us in serious need of a interface upgrade. It's still stuck in 2015.
"Good app, wish they had a tabbed style interface which would make it easier to compare"
"I have had a good experience shopping on Amazon, only two times have I not received my order. But overall not bad."
Very bad very very bad my name is jay and i got a really bad experience from the delivery team they come to my parking and call me saying that there is no parking her you come down and take the parcel if you need and when i go down there are 3 parking slots empty this happened for 3 times to me if yoh are doing this plz stop home delivery and the people come to deliver are also not from Amazon they are some random people comming in there privet cars and behaviour is pathetic. DISAPPOINTED
"I have a awesome experience every time , on time delivery and all very acceptable will definitely continue"
My experience is wonderful i have been a 6 year shopper. I love the product amd. Service delivery. Oneday i willbe able ti afford prime faster delivery. Wonderful
I have had good experiences using this application. 👌
Excellent shopping experiences Always a full range of products and prices. Prime is GREAT!!
great experience to shop on
Good shopping experience
Always have a fairly pleasant experience.
Gets the job done but app experience has and will continue to be poop as long as it's a hybrid app.
Great experience with Amazon and will continue to shop from here Amzon has amazing prices and deals and I love the shipping toooo ! Amazon is the best outta this world !
Really love Amazon. I've had good experiences with the company. The children love Amazon too.. thanks for all you do.
Always a great experience
This is the best and worst shopping experience. Lol. I spend too much but I'm grateful for all the things I can find at Amazon. Ty
I cant get the opt to take ans this is more trouble than ive ever experienced with you. Sick of trying opt me out of amazon.
"Slow app, unintuitive interface, poor structure of menus and payment always gets declined"
"Amazon is the best ""armchair"" online shopping experience! if you can think it, you'll probably find it on Amazon."
Such a big variety. Easy to compare items. Many reviews have videos. Great shopping experience
Very bad experience.i order something 3days ago and the price keep increase everytime I check my invoice.i tried asking why but I was told it's because am paying by cash.
fantastic shopping experience with great support. Thanks for the great support you give
"Used to be a good app, but now it simply doesn't work. Surprisingly bad for a company that I think normally provides a pretty good customer experience."
My first experience was not good at all. Though Later it became better but Amazon has never cut money from me without any just cause
I do enjoy & truly appreciate Amazon along with there customer representative's.....absolutely awesome experience everytime.
"I always had a bad experience on it , either deliver or payments and even support"
Amazing shopping experiences way better than any other online shopping app I have had amazing quality of clothes or covers that come in💖 I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this app😍
I love how everything I find in the stores or on other online stores it's so experience but I get it on Amazon for a great price.
Would be five stars except for jittery scrolling experience I often have. Sometimes I can't scroll at all. It makes me avoid using the app. Other S21 users have the same comments in their reviews.
Good overall have had the service for a few years now and have never really had a bad experience they typically take pretty good care of it's customers
amazon is hands done best shopping experience an customer service is amazing. helpful to me anytime i contact them.
Locked my account and now I can't get it unlocked. Worst experience ever. Since I can't do negative stars this app is worth zero stars
Amazon is a scam. Terrible web app for user interface and terrible customer service. Don't buy from this corporation.
"horrible experience first and only purchase I made, I did not recieve the products and do not reply to emails when I question this."
"Verry bad experienced,this my first time to order and its clear that i put my shepping adress and they are saying that i put wrong adress.. and they canceled my order...do not download this apps wasteing time.."
Best shopping experience esp if you have Prime. Easy to use with numerous product options
"Interface on phones is not as good as on laptops or PCs, but hey, it functions."
Amazon with my experience with Amazon is I order something within one day and the next day I will have it and also when they come at the door they take a picture of the merchandise also they send you text message saying that your products are there at your house so it's awesome love it I suggest everyone should have Amazon
"To all...presently never ever order anything from amazon uae...now they r delivery section given to third party...and those people are illiterate and very bad behaviour like they r our customer and they even question me "" why did u order in office address no one will bring on right time""...I had very bad experience and ruin my best day...and delivery was delayed one day...this my last order amazon...Best move to noon...atleast they trat customer as king.."
Good app to find things you need Made really to use When you use filters Only bad experience is 2 out of 5 times I did not ever get my items Set date delivered when I received
"Great, fast and convenient shopping experience. I'm hardly ever disappointed."
"Amazon has the best shopping experience online! You will not see this anywhere else. I hate to say it, but it's better than the Walmart app!"
Very bad experience most of the sellers don't have stock and they are wasting time on amazon.
"Where would we be without Amazon, especially in these times. Amazon is the ultimate, online shopping experience."
"I have been with this bank over 25 years and have only positive experiences with them. They are always willing to work with you to solve problems, especially when you get charged for something you didn't authorize."
"Worst customer service ever, you can not be sure that in the box that was delivered to you exactly your order, and even more so there is no guarantee that for their mistake they will then return your money, they're just scamming people and then ask do not call and write them about that, all i got worst customer help experience and was scammed on 1300 ponds."
My experience was a nightmare made the mistake assigning up for free prime now I'm completely done with Amazon good riddance
Brilliant not had a bad experience yet 🤞fingers crossed it stays like that cause the shops prices for certain things have gotten expensive.
Usually a great experience but I now can't shop because it's so zoomed in I can't see a single thing I'm shopping for.
Very easy to use. As expected shopping experience. Delivery times and product reviews are the best.
I already Love Amazon. My on-line experience (via PC and laptop) is when I fell---hard---for Amazon.
I can't believe it's already 2020 and the delivery service still return my items without calling me or trying to reach me. Worst shopping experience ever
"Have no complaints. My shopping experience, including returns and customer service has been awesome."
Great shopping experience you have to be careful of postal deliveries but never had bad experience shopping online at Amazon
So far my experience with Amazon has been good and Amazon Prime is even better when you can afford it.
best online shopping experience. please add option in the promo code box to see all the available promo codes.
My experience has been good when I have not received a few of my items the immediately replaced or refunded back my money or gave me credit.
"After years of using this app, I have to learn how to use the new interface. Why is there not an option to leave things alone? I guess I will go back to shopping brick and mortar stores."
"I've been an Amazon customer since 1994, the easiest and best shopping experience ever!!!"
"App UI update is a terrible, akward experience. Amazon, you can do better than this. Shame."
Our experience has been excellent. Goods are delivered well in time and are reasonably priced Excellent quality
This is the worst customer service I've ever experienced. I was arsenal taken advantage of by this company and not given a refund on a 30 dollar item
Great app for a wonderful shopping experience. I've used this app for 12 years and I've never had a bad experience!
"Up until this very moment, I have had a very good experience with the app and web page. Quite the good experience."
Poor user experience. Lacks dark mode even in 2021. Awful data collection and usage practices.
"Great!' I love the ebt, golden state advantage experience. Continue the great work and distributing. A large revenue."
The old UI was much better than this cheap looking UI. Did you let a work experience employee do this?
"my shopping experience has been very good. I don't mind spending my money here. So far no complaints. Thank you for So good service,no matter what. Go figure 😇🐞"
Every Experience with Amazon has been amazing! They deliver the best products at the best prices fastest of all companies.
Amazon is #1 in my personal opinion and experiences. Give them a try and they could be yours too!
Wonderful! Timely with Prime. Great return experiences. This is my go to place for literally everything!
"Amazon Egypt even doesn't deserve the one star, worst experience ever with Amazon Egypt, order not delivered and they marked as handed off and money not refunded,"
The worst experience of my life driver delivered my stuff who knows where Amazon could pretty much care less
Absolutely absurd customer experience. These idiots are so incredibly incompetent to say that I am not myself and have falsely accessed my account from my devices. Customer service was contacted and still is powerless to handle their own problems. I really don't care to even give them a single star. Get out and do your own shopping and close down this sweat shop business.
"Ridiculous Experience. Customer service terrible. Multiple people lied to me, hung up on me, and/or been of zero help"
I love how easy it is to use this app. It makes shopping a fun experience. Thank you Amazon for making a user friendly app!
"Great experience, lots of items, free shipping and at a very good price. 👍"
It's the worst app if you want to save your time and energy do shop from Amazon UAE I have had the worst experience with them
Most of the functions I often use are easily accessible. To notch shopping experience.
"good experience, but still have to work on all my missing packagez, i mean i do always get my money back im not mad about that but i really needed my items instead"
"Very wonderful company, great app ,and excellent music, shopping, reading and watching experience."
The worst experience I found shopping by amazon uae sometimes items not delivered sometimes items missing.
"It's been real great experience! Have had couple minor issues before but not big deal, still very happy."
Pleaaaase improve the interface ... it really suck ....and u r AMAZON u have enough money to give the user a better experience
My experience with Amazon was amazing. Everything that's I bought was perfect. I love Amazon.
i am new to all of this but Amazon makes it so easy and all of my orders have been on time . a wonderful experience. I thank you.
"Fantastic experience, the updates made a lot of nessecary improvements. This is my primary shopping app, going forward."
Language setting does not change at all. Interface buggy. App sucks
Easy to order. Extensive list where to use from. Excellent experience!
Never had a late delivery and all items came in perfect condition unlike my experience with other services.
The worst online shopping experience ever. I got conned and i lost a lot of money because of Amazon
Awful experience item never came or it just refund the order for no reason waited 40 days for a controller that never came or ship.
Very bad experience I just added 1000 ruppes for Amazon but I can't use it really socking also I can't see Amazon pay option.
VERY GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE. the app interface is completely garbage since the update though or I'd give it a 5 star rating.
Oh DEAR GOD PLEASE PLEASE roll back to the last update this interface sucks and makes me want to stop using the app!
No words to describe the brilliance of the products and services available... simply fabulous experience
So easy and fast and smooth experience while using the application and proper notification of upcoming offers
I would suggest make Amazon refurbished as a different app so customers can experience clean Amazon app with only new items and expected prices.
Hate the update. The new layout is awful. Did nothing to enhance my shopping experience.
love the app great interface easy to use. definitely would recommend it to my family & friends
Very happy with overall experience. Deliveries are on time .It is very easy to track the shipment.
didn't get it the first time but Amazon was amazing they replaced it with in 2 day's best customer service experience
Still waiting for a refund almost a month after they didn't send me my package. Rough experience.
Really it was wonderful shopping experience.. sure you will be my first choice.. you guys are doing good impressive....
Smooth buying experiences as well as returns. Love the versatility!
Fabulous experience and can only get better. Very pleased with the service now
"awesome deals, delivery and customer service experiences! the app is a cinch to use."
"I was ordered poco f1, money was debit after 5 days automatically my order was canceled by amazon, even i couldn't get any clarification worst experience ever"
Very bad app even i have order 4th time lot off delay not deliver at time bad experience .
"Quit moving stuff around with ""fresh"" completely useless interfaces."
This app is good for people who use it and when I used it it was a good experience I'd just like to know why it is automatically on my phone and I cannot uninstall it
I used to love Amazon and had amazing experience till they started using Intercom Express courrier in Edmonton Alberta. They are the worst courrier.
"Nothing but bad experiences. Constantly receive the wrong products, used products or fraudulent knockoff products."
Well I have had a bad experience with them where my package never even arrived so I had to get a refund from them because of this and it's sad cause they were amazing for me untill then
Really appreciate the experience with Amazon. Now I don't have to go out to the store to purchase what need. I can get it delivered right to my door. Thank you!
🌈 it's a REALLY-REALLY gOOd EXPERIENCE each time I've used them for my consumer nEEds... Thankful for the app & how user friendly it is!! 😉🙏😃
I've been an Amazon customer for a long time I've not had any bad experiences I hope I don't so far so good 😄they are always willing to help a customer
I enjoy shopping from the convenience of my home. Most often it is a great experience and with no hassle returns.
Was great until the new search bar was put on the bottom ruins whole experience.
Rarely run into delays/issues. Overall I'm quite happy with my experiences of using the app (nearly every single day lol)
Worst online application from my experience.So many times not delivered my orders.they take orders but during the delivery date they have some excuse.Refund procedures take long time.hats off Amazon team.
"I ordered order but I faced the Worst customer service at ever withFailure delivery, Bad follow up Expensive products My experience was not the best"
"I love Amazon, I have bought many things on their app and it is a good experience"
"I am unpleased with this COMPANY however reviewing the app not the jack wagons whom run it nor work for Bezos, they lie steal and shame their customers for items being stolen not delivered or broken and completely different from what's advertised on the app disappointment to say the very least shame on AMAZON they need and can do better however they don't have too because they are a Rich conglomerate of Jack Wagons and careless about customers experience and more about the bottom line. SHAMEFULL"
So far the experience has been nothing short of amazing. Such a huge learning experience. Thanks to everyone who supported me. Glen
"Zero buyer protection. Will not buy again from amazon ever. And as for the app, it's just a website interface"
app is STILL PAINFULLY sluggish and laggy and just awful to use honestly just opening up amazon in your browser is a better experience
Phenomonal user experience. Benchmark really for ease of access. and reliability.
I'm a faithful client of amazon prime italy per years but recently i experience a disappointment from their service in partner of shipping company that cannot trace my package. All my info is correct and i don't know the problem why they tollerate a kind of service of delay shipping. PRIME is a paid service so all the client can receive in 3 days but not in my case. I'm waiting for more than 7 days and keep delaying my packages. There is a lot of logistic company can respect & complied a duty.
I have been updating my movie library with Amazon along with my graphic novel collection ... I am so very happy with my experiences
"i mean is just like the browser, is simple and always work, haven't hhad a bad experience with this app"
Amazon really has great deals and my shopping experience with them has been great.
overall satisfactory experience.
Who doesn't love AMAZON?!?! App is awesome and I've NEVER had a bad experience with their customer service!
Good overall experience. Amazon works great for me.I like shopping Amazon for home improvement.
"Bad experience on app and website, it has many glitches which is making it frustrating to use."
Great experience! Product is what I want and looks nice. Ordering was easy.
one of the best shopping experience I have ever seen. the best products + high quality + the best prices in the market + on time delivery + great support from customer service.
"my first experience with Amazon and Amazon prime specially was not that good, i received my delivery one day later however the costumer service was really helpful"
"Searching products on this app is really painful, need a good interface to filter products easily."
quite laggy and unresponsive on android not a very pleasant experience.
"The delivery sucks, i became a prime member so that I can get better delivery experience but na'a. Ts like nobody cares."
Very bad experience i order shoes i received used shoes and when comes to return the driver didnt pick up the return very arrogant not recommend
"I struggle to share items, i have to screenshot them to share them with people, you need to work on the interface we use mire than that"
"easy, convenient, fast and overall best online shopping experience."
I have had this app installed for a couple of years now and have never experienced a problem with it. Overall I am extremely happy with it
"I have had very good experience with Amazon Shopping, Items come on time and are New As Ordered."
"Would love to actually spend to a human regarding my issue. Over all a happy amazon prime customer but in 2020 was banned from writing reviews why, ""suspicious activity"" of what kind idk tried to appeal it and get more information to understand how that came to be and got nowhere. its a shame that a paying customer who spends lots of money cannot even get clarity on their own account considering I make my purchases off of reviews I used to write mine based on my experience amazon do better."
Amazon greatest experience orders on time and in great condition thank you Amazon and at a fair price better get this.
"constant errors with dogs, no choice of language in France, unreasonable account blocks (always talking to robots and auto emails). overall terrible experience"
updated and now interface is confusing and not as easy to use.
I just love Amazon I have never had any negative experience with them or their delivery guys I always appreciate their driver when they bring me my items in time
"My experience is that on line shopping is killing All American brick &mortar stores and it was the worst idea ever with social media in a very close 2nd , oh & let's not for get it has more updates than Cindy Jackson has plastic surgery."
Extremely bad. Please dnt get trapped by amazon!! I have recently very very bad experience.. stay away from amazon
"I think they take the think part out of the grocery shopping experience and teleport our thoughts through this little app that Jeff Bezos has masterminded over the last few decades cultivating this pressure cooker that us as consumers just eat up daily all pun intended in fact I think he thinks we are all robots communicating through machines to other robots our exact wants, desires, needs and just about everything under the the sun with the exception of porn which is quickly being developed"
"The best online shopping app on the planet, I've had a few hiccups here and there, but my overall shopping experience is still 5 star"
Amazon Books always provides a premium experience when searching for new books to read and puchase.
Outstanding shopping experience. Unique with its own style and excellent prices.
Extremely bad experience they took my order and payment 2 times and iam trying hard to reach the customer services but I can't
I have had great experience with Amazon and Amazon customer service. Very happy!
very few bad experience but customer service so far has been great at adjusting the issues.
I had a package scheduled to be delivered today and they waited until 945pm to tell me my package would not be delivered on time and may be a day or two late! Too late to go to another store now and I needed that stuff in the morning. The kicker..Amazon was at my house already once today and delivered half of the order!! Absolutely horrible experience and after years of being a customer im deleting my account. Absolutely disgusted.
always has been a great buying experience. Been a Prime member for nearly 10 years now.
They've lost my packages 7 times then locked my account and won't refund my last order. Worst experience ever.
"Worst experience, horrible service during delivery. Several failed orders and no regard for customer."
Amazon is the most comprpensive and efficient shopping and delivery service that I have experienced up to date.
Really such. A bad experience I had with them I bought order that never arrived and the seller never respond and I will wait for 1 to 2 weeks to see if I will have money back
"Most experiences were great couple of packages lost, stopped buying groceries when prices jumped too high"
A downgrade of the souq shopping experience. I can no longer tell who sells a selected product later on tell their customer rating. Bad
Its a good app always has been decent but its time for new software and a much better customer experience than just ok
Amazon is very reliable. I have been having wonderful experience since 2017 or thereabout.
My experience has been great. I have had jewelry lost or it takes forever to deliver.
Why you don't have Hindi language interface for echo show 15? Why Hindi is not yet available for echo show 15? Please add Hindi as soon as possible.
If your driver gives your packages to total strangers in the street. You'll have a better experience than I had.
Amazing experience similar to those great experiences I had when I was in space ...looking back to earth.
"great shopping experience, have been let down a few times with non deliveries (amazon prime customer) so should be next day"
The worst shopping experience ever. They don't care about customers. Their technology sucks. Do not support this place at all.
"Amazon is a one-stop shopping experience where you can find the best prices and have exactly what you want ship to you very shortly. A great company. I simply didn't give him five stars because the founder Jeff bezos is someone who's politics and personal lack of will to donate some of his trillions, and yes I said TRILLIONS OF DOLLAR towards the things that matter, like homelessness, mental health which leads to drug addiction which can often be a straight shot to homelessness."
The app is quite fine. Just not using Amazon anymore due to some negative experiences.
"The best shopping app there is. Seamless, Effortless and Efficient experience."
"Bad bad experience.. terrible customer service.. I just uninstalled, be careful with these people they charged doble. Hate amazon.... go for Wayfair best customer service ever.."
So dumb since theyve changed it. So hard just to find where to log out or switch accounts why?? Poor interface
Why the heck did they put the search bar on the bottom??? It's messing up the entire shopping experience. It's all screwed up now. Wth???
excellent experience you can find anything that you want and at a reasonable cost.
"I must feel bad multiple times to comment here ,it's about overseas branch operation, which is awful,the bank offers either not work or it's too complicated and even going to work on some items only works with very limited cap! It almost nothing or wave the shipping fees, can I ask WTH? And plz don't telling me kindly share ur experience with us ,u guys share ur fake bank deals with buyers, feel disappointed just hope things go back at least to couple years ago .but anyway we missed the prime 😞"
Its a mind bloing aap i have really good experience in this aap it has very good stuff quality in cheap prices in my opinion this one of the great aap in the world thank you!
perfect experience very few issues over the years customer service always good plus prime membership offers great value for money
Amazon's shopping interface is the standard I judge all other shopping apps against. Outstanding.
"It has been an wonderful experience, from shopping to shipping, and the customer service was great"
"Very bad experience, ordered first time take my money and block my account, now they ask for billig statement, so very bad experience, better avoid"
Very smooth and easy to use User interface love this app. Better than browse based shopping on PC or tablet
Very bad app there is no pakistani currency option available here.then why r u selling and shipping in pak i totally don't recommend this in pakistan.vvv bad experience with this app.
"The interface and interaction are not so smooth as it should be, or at least as I would expect."
"My experience was amazing besides one of my packages being late. Besides from that , this app has been great."
I appreciate the simple interface that allows me to make quick purchases from my phone.
I have always had the best experiences with Amazon! It is my number 1 shopping site!
Very shopping-enhancing. Seamless integration of the entire Amazon experience. Well done.
I have had great shopping experiences with Amazon and am now a prime membership holder. this is a great app.
Worst shopping experience and low quality customer service
"Fake customer service and unreliable service, so many bad shopping experiences so I don't recommend it at all."
"Amazing experience, and exceptional customer support. No matter what your situation is, the customer support agent will find a way to help you."
Incredible shopping experience. Can find anything here that you need and want. Love it!
My experiences have been absolutely perfect. I think this is the best company that I have ever in my 73 years dealt with and I thank you.!
"Confusing UI, still slow, what happened?!? Dont update unless you want your experience to be more confusing"
My Amazon experience has almost always been good. I would highly recommend them to anyone I know.
Only giving three stars cuz the app keeps crashing which ruins the otherwise great shopping experience.
"This is really great, amazing and wonderful shopping centre.I have wonderful experience on it.I appreciate it.keep it up."
"I am amazon user from many Years, I am facing a very bad experience now I did a purchase through amazon App due to damaged product was delivered, I placed a return request and ask to refund it to Amazon balance. Now not allowing me to use Amazon Balance, to purchase, support team is asking for KYC For amazon pay I said I am not interested in AmazonPay To use my balance I have to give kyc to amazon pay which I am not interested I need help some one can help to get my amount back"
My amazon experience has always been unbeatable. Delivery is always perfect and satisfactory.
I always have the BEST shopping 🛍️ experience with Amazon. It's my Many Stop And Shop place for everything I need and want. 🤩
"Best experience ever! Great Products, Fresh Foods Love all the Great selections. I love my experience with Amonazon. No complaints Keep up the Good Integrety👍👍👍👍👍"
"Good experience -easy transactions,affordable deals, great customer experience....read descriptions!! 30 return policy not bad"
"In my first good experience with amazon. Wow ,I impressed it.i received my order before 24 hours. That's why I give 5 star 🌟 🤩 ✨ 😎"
Put the search bar back on the top of the page please. It's creating a poor user experience.
My experience in amazon is very very easy to shop and delivering excellent quality product.
Horrible experience. They try saying give you all the support but it's lie. You just spend your money and you can't trust in that business.
Hate that the search bar is on bottom now. It really screws over the whole in-app experience.
Always a good experience. Deliveries are quick and appreciated.
I usually get what I want when I shop at Amazon. They provide a good shipping experience.
Yooo I fully regret updating my app. It's not user friendly!! Bring back the old interface!!
The app is incredibly slow. My phone isn't low spec either. Terrible experience.
Very awesome experience all the time they deliver in time in these pandamic time also great job great services by Amazon.
"I've had a terrible experience with this app, how you can you lock me out of two of my accounts with alot of my money in it for no reason and I call everyday to get it unlocked and they'll tell me wait 24-48hrs so they put me through how to get it unlocked and they never do, honestly you all should be sued for this, are you guys now Thiefs, please you all should help look into this , I'm really frustrated by this unprofessional behaviour"
"would like more promo. I buy a lot of experience and still ego is deep for battery option. sx line, cheers"
"Best app. I love it, does not give any issue at all, easy shopping experience"
I can always find something special ... I luv shopping at amazon online ... It's a wonderful experience ...
"Not good, Terrible experience. I dont want to recommend this never Etsy and wish are more.better and other retailers apps"
I'm definitely not a fan of the most recent update the new user interface is not user-friendly at all.
Experience was good but please change or update this app for Android Go also because some of the phone is based on Android Go
"worst first time experience ever ...I truly regret wasting my time and money with this large, clumsy and stupid Company....I hope a competitor runs them out of business soon. This APP and telephone customer service are useless ."
I love Amazon. She was my first on line shopping experience and I can tell you that things only get better with age! Most of my house and my closets were designed by Amazon and I am one satisfied customer! Thanks for all you do Ammy!! Brandy Gochenouer
"Had a very bad experience, tried reloading my account with a virtual card and i got blocked, called amazon freaking 4 times every single day, I jst give up🤦‍♂️"
Worst helpline experience can't solve the problem successfully asks OTP from both contact no. And email
"Decent shopping experience, but be cautious for knockoffs, fake reviews, and scammers. Amazon isn't what it use to be."
Amazon is an awesome experience. I have always been able to find what I need at a good price.
Well my first experience with the place was very wonderful with everyone and everything but now I'm use to it and adopt some good things for now nothing else matters to me but make this night memories.
Amazon pantry is really intrusive i cant get what i want now and that really sucks i wanted to buy something but i sent me straight to amazon pantry and what i was looking for wasnt even a food item my regular buying experience is 10x harder now that i cant get to what i want with ease so please make a fix soon
"The app is not evolving. Confusing, slow and bad user experience."
"Amazon Egypt: Worst Customer Experience, Worst Customer Service employees and mangers. The employees are talking like machines and never tries to understand the problem or tries to solve They cancelled an order for no reason and refused to refund me the money into my account to buy the products again ,, and told I will receive it at my bank account within 7days. The price of the products changed and they refused to compensate me with the difference price, although the problem was from their side"
"Hey Amazon, you have blocked my account after i have order and pay for my orders, you are asking some documents from me to validate my account wich i have sent to you already several times the doc sent was copy of paseport of my card with hiden details with my home adress prove and you still want something more. I had an verry bad experience and its not posible to call your service center to speak."
First time doing most of my Christmas shopping through Amazon. Great experience.I will definitely keep using it & recommend it 👌
The favorites doesn't download. It's slow and for me user experience is bad.
I've always liked Amazon. They have just what I need for my crafts. My experience has been wonderful.
Amazon experience has been great. Such fast and accurate deliveries!
Secure and convenient online buying experience. Also you can request for refund or replacement
"Love Amazon! Esp the product shipping, haven't even had a bad experience."
"Bad experience. Last time face very bad experience. we ordered IFB dishwasher liquid. We received empty and uncealed bottle, of 250 milliliter, in 10kg bag."
"I have had a great experience with this app, it makes everything tooooooo easy to get my hands on."
"so far so good, but there's a small problem I've been experienced the app is crashing often."
Amazon exceeds all expectations. The fastest customer support I have ever experienced.
"My experience sucked they gave me 1, business day to return a package and it's been a month since I sent it and still no refund or anything I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APP FOR ANYTHING"
I had bad experience with my 3 orders. I received the wrong items. Not interested anymore
Engaged support with actionable responses to all relevant queries makes shopping with Amazon's platform the most reasonable & optimal experience I've enlisted in ~gratitude 🙏🏽
Excellent shopping and shipping options. Simply the best online shopping experience!
I have a bad experience with Amazon costumer service I get insolted and never get help every time they refuse to refund my money to my account they want to add it to my wallet and all the staff Egyptian staff they are really rude and no one follow them with their services
wts wrong with Amazon india? Very poor filter options and very bad browsing interface
"Worst search of any large online seller, interface is junk. Unfortunately the website search is the same"
"I love the app,Ive had good and bad experiences with it!!! Please keep working to get better."
"Ugly app design, horrible user experience. For the 2nd most successful company in the S&P 500 Amazon needs to catch up. Not to mention the fraudulent business practices and over monopolization. I gave you a 1 month chance, you failed so I now have cancelled all Amazon services. Hope more customers open their eyes and expand their horizons."
My Experience has been lovely shopping with Amazon I truly love the app it's fast it's right down to the point.
Couldn't find the app on my phone. Couldn't get it to work. Had to go into the store and let someone know I was there. Not great experience.
I have had nothing but a super awesome experience shopping with Amazon!!! Awesome App!!!
I've had nothing but satisfying experiences so far from ordering through Amazon! Thank you!
"Excellent experience, reasonable and quick delivery any issue with product they solve as quick as"
Excellent shopping experience. Fast delivery. Returns without hassle.
I always have a beneficial experiences when make my purchases. Top quality items at fair prices
very easy and efficient shipping experience with excellent customer service and great choice!
Can't done the app anymore without getting political garbage shoved in my face. Who people have sex with should not be part of my shopping experience. App is narrow minded and bigoted.
I have received awesome customer service through my experience with the app. Thanks!
"The user experience is horrible i cant even find the sign iut option and the app using web view, why a big company like amazon make app with web view"
Wait... why did you change the menu interface?? This isn't a good update.
it's ok. the interface is kinda clunky and confusing at first but otherwise alright
"Great app. Provides a good shopping experience, similar to a PC browser."

It's amazing to have u on the cell but plz improve the UI and also let the interface be of the size of the screen of the cell..not so small as its now
Nice.. But w8n 4 an upgraded interface
not worth installing... bad interface...
this app is less of an app and more of an interface to the mobile site. flippy howevr awesome ur service is u must do better with this app!!!
Im really disappoint from flipkart User-Interface. Nothing but just a simple internet explorer. Really slow
Interface is like mobile version webpage.
For a leading company I had a better expectations on its apps...  Needs to have better interface
Good to see the Flipkart app here. Nivce interface but missing some features such as there is no option to sort on the basis of price or popularity.  Moreover reviews or ratings are not available with the products. Though we can browse various categories its quality cannot be reviewed.
Very poorly made.  Lagy interface.  No options to sort or shortlist.
Nice but improve your user interface make it a large full application like ebay application
"I was expecting a stand-alone app, not something which would open a mobile version of the website! Granted the website has a clean interface, but I was expecting something different.. Sorry flipkart, only 2 stars for you. And I am uninstalling too.. I can access the website directly from my browser thank you."
Very good interface and easy to use and browse through the products.  But few things: 1. Need to have an exit button for the app rather than pressing back key repeatedly to exit. 2. The products should display of they are having any offers.
A web interface? Really? WTF?
need to improve interface speed in Samsung galaxy s duos its too slow in search n clicking process ..  thank you..
Wonderful user friendly interface
Wrapping the site as an app is misleading users... not expected out of flipkart. Make user friendly UI which will actually enrich the user experience or make the website responsive.. might help.
It did crash once. But still love the interface and the ease to search.
The newly released api is just too good.. smooth interface. .. all functionalities integrated.. awesome app.
I haven't shopped yet on this app but user interface is just cool.
Finally an app from flipkart much needed already. Good interface with fluid browsing experience.
After the update the app is amazing. Great user interface.
This update is really good with improved user interface..  good work
"Fresh design , easy to use interface and very fast .   Well deserved 5 stars  Nexus 4"
Flipkarts app provides quick and an awesome user interface....flipkart is the best online shopping media in india.....flipkarts delivery is very jst within a day or two u get ur product  Hats off to flipkart....keep it up
So simplified user interface and it is really fast to navigate through so many choices. Great going flipkart...
The interface is attractive and friendly. It's very helpful too.
"Nice interface, superb search"
"A very good app indeed. Clean and very intuitive user interface. Just one issue, even when I log into my account, I can't find the ""My Wishlist"" tab. If u guys could release an update to fix this issue, it'd be great!! Thanks!"
Excellent app and awesome interface
Best app for online buying. ..smooth and ultra fast...luv the interface. ..
This is way better than the earlier Flipkart app which basically took you to the main website... Love the interface. Really good job!
"Thanx for this flipkart......really needed this. Interface is beautiful and smooth and browsing through products is a cinch. There is a slight issue with the sidebar showing the categories,it doesn't scroll properly,so I am unable to access the categories at the bottom sometimes. Fix that and I'll give five stars..."
Great app.!! Great interface !!
"Please add the option to add items we are shopping to the wishlist. Also, the user interface could be made smoother to navigate."
Improved so much compare to the old flipkart app...fast loading..clear display...interface is really superb..
Excellent application !! Superb user experience. I would prefer it over website which is a big compliment for the developers.
The app is very fast and I love the beautiful interface.
Great app easy interface and fun to use ....great work
Rocking user interface
The new version is awesome. Has one of  my most wished feature Wishlist. Had been waiting for it from a long time.	Amazing app. Best online mall. One of the best apps. Would also want a way to short list and. compare Good user experience. Way  better than Amazon & Ebay.
Need to improve interface!!!
Nice shopping and Easy user interface experience... Enjoy....
Hats off to the developers of this application. You have really improved the interface and introduced almost every option that was available on the main site. At the time of the initial release of the application it didn't have anything. Great work :-D
Gr8 user interface.Loved it.
"Despite so many categories and products, the interface never feels cramped. Really good design and fully functional app"
Slick interface... Nice to look at
"Interface is good but, my app is getting uninstalled from my mobile automatically and also the app gets logged in automatically with someone's account from some other place. Kindly fix these issues since confidential information of an user is involved with this application. Hope you understand."
Nice interface.  But extremely unstable. It crashed 4 times in the first 15 minutes I used it.  Stopped using it after that
Interface is good. A little slow. Wishlist is not in sync with the Web . But all these are not such a major problem.  Amazon's app is much better
Really good concept. Awesome interface.. really keeps the customer captive.!!
Clean and neat interface
"very smooth user interface, easy to navigate. great functionality"
Unbelievably intuitive interface. Not seen such a nicely programmed app recently. You want to go back to this app just to enjoy your smartphone.

Less data consuming..clean interface good image quality..very good then normal website browsing in browser..
Much better interface
The user interface is very neatly designed. But i saw different prices on web and mobile version. Infact it didnot allow me to pay by mobile application. I went on to web using same card the payment gone through.. Neex better functionality handling.
"Interface..just AWESOME  Need a fix (Galaxy Note) - clicking on 'My Orders', the app exits."
A good app with very interactive interface for shopping.
"Overall good interface to browse and purchase.  Some things to improve, - Should allow to modify details like address. If you enter wrong details, there no way to modify unless you enter new. - Filtering items tabbed interface is difficult to use."
It's user friendly  interface is really admirable. Very fast n smooth.... very good work devs.
Easy and user friendly interface and easy ordering
"Placing Order just got easier With this,takes Not More than 1 min to place an order & it shows you the logistics too ...and interface of the app is Awesome..flipkart Rocks !!"
"The best among the apps of all online shopping sites. Far better than snapdeal app.  Great user interface , very user friendly"
"Finally beginning to become the app it was meant to be...  Keep up the good work...  Im rooting for you'll  Here's a suggestion, in my day to day life i sometimes notice a few things on TV that i may want so i go to flipkart and try to find them, but can't, so i suggest an interface that can tell flipkart about missing products so they can immediately fill in these gaps. I'm sure that I'm not the only one who has found products that aren't there, if you can implement this in sure that you'll get more sales"
I check regularly about all electronic appliances about their specifications using flipkart . Great User Interface and very useful app
"It looks like real work has been put in to make this an app worthy of praise. Instead of just porting the webpage onto an app form, flipkart have come out with something with better UI, navigation and overall a mightily improved user experience. Awesome job guys!  So if you're an avid shopaholic and want to go easier on the pocket, don't download it because this app will make you shop more. :-P"
Good interface... Really love the app
The app is fluid and the interface responsive. The app is a one stop destination for flipkart products. No ambiguities in specifications and clarity regarding products. (Y) kudos to the devs !!
Great application. Friendly user interface.
Buy things on the go...impressive in a very easy user interface!!!
Great interface... and a lovely shopping experience at one go
If you r particular to only flipkart then use it. It helps a lot. Friendly interface and good support.
Like the app and its interface no. 1 app for shopping
"Its fast, easy to use, soothing to eye, detailed, clean interface."
The user interface is really simple and easy to understand. Also the app runs fast.
Very cheap user interface and fake items .....
"This is the best shopping app. Ever ,I ve been shopping like phones and many things.its a pleasure to shop here and its damn easy.user friendly interface......."
"This app has very good navigational interface. Flipkart has made it very easy to look for items. The app also presents order history in easy to understand interface. It is very easy to search for an item with the search feature, and filters are also easy to use."
Flipkart u have to seriously work on the interface of app. But it is still a good app.
Nice interface
Very easy to use!! Awosum interface and UI

Good interface and of course super quick delivery user friendly app
Excellent interface.
Good interface
I would like to see an option wherein customer adds his pincode in the beginning of search and only been shown those products/list which can be delivered to his address. As its waste of time seeing those products in the list which can't be delivered to your address. This feature would definitely enhance the user experience. Hope you consider this.
"Gr8 user friendly app, light weight interface...  overall gud user experience"
Loved it's interface
"very usefull,easy to use nd nice uesr interface"
Smooth interface to do quick shopping
App user interface and help texts are good & easy to use. Filters and category list are nice. Add to cart feature is not working. Evrytime when cart is sekected it displays cart as empty. How do I purchase multiple items in a row!! Guys fix it or u may loose orders :) 2 rating is because of this functional bug. No point in having good UI if the desired function is not working!
Superb App.... Easy Interface... Everything is Cool ;-)
The app has good user interface..almost similar to that of apple's..various pages are easily navigable.. however more options could have been added..overall its an excellent app which needs a little polishing by the side..
Nice.. Awesome interface. Simple to use!!
"This app is equiped with cool features, with interactive interface. It was a good experience."

Nice and fluid interface. Enjoy using it.
The best user interface incorporated in an Android application ever. As always Flipkart:)
Very accurate interface.......

Navigation within the app is really good with complementing user interface.
The new interface is wat really kills it & flipkart DA best
Easy interface.
Every things workin fine. Interface is awesome. But it logout automatically after some time or after restarting the device which I hates d most. Hope yu guys ll work on it.
"Love the ease of use, the interface and its very light! Good job"
"Simple interface,very easy to understand"
"Great interface ....fast and responsive , easy to use ....best app for Indian online shopping"
Really impressed by the interface and far better than the desktop site. Also very easy to use.
The interface of app is really good and viewing products is very easy.  Also categorisation is great. Thumbs up....
The previous app was essentially just a webpage which opened inside the app. The updated one however has really smooth interface as expected.  Great job Flipkart.......
"Nicely made,easy to use and at fast in surf & fluidic interface."
Its aa usefup app. Its user interface is very good. BUT NOT WORTH TO IMPRESS ME.

Should include compare option for products in this app for better user experience.
"Great Application, If you guys could change the UI Interface A bit that would be even Cooler. :)"
"Great app, clean interface. The only problem is that some times pages fail to load. I'm not sure if it's a problem with all users or if it is just an isolated issue."
Excellent interface. Useful
"Very quick,easy tracking, user interface is really good. But at times the app just fails to respond."
Great interface and some really awesome features make this app a must have for any shopaholic!!
Good design and interface.
This is by far the best and the most reliable shopping application on India... Love it's interface and easy accessibility. Deserves nothing less than 5 stars.
Good user friendly interface !!
It has got everything how a good reputed shopping site should have. I just love the ease of user interface. Its so easy to look out for a product.  But I would have a one very important suggestion for you. U have many sellers apart from your own ws retail. But not sellers deliver their products everywhere. So I would like you to add another section in your search categories to refine the search according to the sellers that are selling a particular product
Flipkart app is too good to shop. Very good user interface. In love with flipkart. Genuine products and exciting offers.
"This app is very smooth user interface for mobile shopping, truly flipkart is baap of all online shopping."
the interface of your application is really good but the tracking system is not at all giving out the correct details so please look into it
Good animation and good user interface. Totally usefull
"The best online shopping app I have ever seen..the interface is amazing,quite smooth and easy to use."
Good interface
"User interface is easy, app is designed in a beautiful way. U would hardly have any problem while placing the order.. 5 on 5. Give some more discounts ;-)"
User friendly interface.........not that bad

Awesome user interface .... Surf smoothly !!
Amazing app..saves tym..and nice user interface.
Interface seems pretty cool.
I tried this app before but that time it was just a link to the actual website. But this time this app is really helpful and having easy user interface.
Easy user interface
The interface is not as friendly as the the website and is slower
This app provides a very good interface. I didnt get confuse for the very first time. Now i use it very frequently and it is so damn simple.
Easy n friendly user interface
"A clean neat interface, backed by the very trust worthy and powerful flipkart service. Keep up the good work flipkart :)"
This app scores over Amazon's app in terms of smooth user interface and design. More work needs to b done on tracking aspect. Flipkart is doing its best to stay Number 1 and to compete with global giant Amazon. The app is a proof of this philosophy.
I found it good at interface...
Very easy and comfortable interface....attractive too...
"Nice and easy to use interface and thorough categorization make its easy, convenient and delightful shopping experience"
Pretty fast n clean interface!
Really easy to use and the interface is good too.
Easy navigation. Simple interface. Simply amazing!!!
Flipkart may not have reached places but easy to order interface is much better den amazon. Amazon asks for CBC details and end the process is so tedious. Flipkart roxx
Bad interface and worst.
"Very user-friendly interface,hassle free access."
The app functions very smoothly. The user interface and layout is very user friendly. Feedback: Should have an option to check wallet balance.
Very friendly user interface...
Excellent interface!!
Good interface....
Has a better user interface compared to Amazon and snapdeal!
Love the design and flow of the app. Loads quickly and interface is clean. Notification and order tracking are superbly real time and easy to follow.
Absolutely useful and easy interface
Best interface of application
Very nice interface
Very very... easy to use... fabulous user interface ... deserves 5 stars.
Very good user interface
"Nice interface, Easy to use & Faster.."
The user interface is nice. But basically your app SUCKS. It shows unknown error quite often. Can't browse properly.
Easy user interface
Very good interface for product listing and product information...simple and faster checkout steps...
Nice interface and user friendly
Today i completed 10 purchases n countered no problem till now.. app interface is better than those of amazon and myntra.. only problem is many items are out of stock and remain so for a long period of tym.. e.g. a duke jacket i wanna purchase is out of stock for more than half a year now..
Very good user interface
"The app crashes frequently irrespective of number of items shown on the page. Also, it gives different information on different pages. For example, if I search for the iPhone 5S, top of the results is the Gold variant priced at 37xxx. When I tap on it and open the page, it shows me a price of 34xxx. While the drop in price is OK, makes me wonder where all the prices may have gone up based on page. Overall, makes for a poor user experience."
Brilliant user interface & good offers as well
"Very good app, nice user interface, EASY AS YOU LIKE."
Love The Interface . Easy and Neat ! Great Job
Good interface and quiet fast!
Hats off to Flipkart with the way they are revolutionizing e-shopping in india.Making a benchmark for the industry.Phenomenal and Well Made app for top class user experience

One of the best interface. Filters are pretty useful.
Amazing app.. Very fine tuned app with awesome user experience
Loved the interface!!!!!
Flipkart is provided nice application interface for shopping
Sometimes the application lags but overall a nice user interface similar to desktop usage
"One of the best and trusted online store. Earlier application had several issues which are fixed now. But still i feel interface, filter options can be improved. More importantly mobile app does not give any option to rate a product and write reviews."
The user interface is nice and easy. Just the picture quality of the products are not good as the ones in myntra. And sometimes it lags a bit. Overall it's nice.
"The flipkart app has avery good interface and the entire process and experience is good even on a 2G connection. I gave it a 4 because I have been encountering a bug in the app. Even though my cart is empty, the shopping cart keeps displaying my previous cart history. It only gets reset on refreshing the cart. I hope they fix it in their next update. All in all a good app, right from browsing through order and payment."
Thanks Flipkart for the app... Very nice interface...
"Just downloaded and I love it's interface. Clear, everything at palce and easy access. Fantastic."
"Flipkart app has always been the best shopping app. Shopping made very easy with simple interface and search, filtering options are very convenient."

"good interface, easy to use and light."
user interface is precise and filters are perfectly refined
The app interface is amazing as well as the delivery of flipkart. But the app lags and crashes down very often. Kindly fix this issue!!!!

"Interface is good and that's about it. Even on high speed wifi searching takes ages, errors occur while getting data from server etc. Uninstalliing now. Waste of time and bandwidth."
Very good Interface
Really super duper hit app jst love itzz new interface
Not sure why even on a great WiFi or 3g connection app is quite sluggish and throws errors. Interface and user surfing menu seems good
"User experience on app is quite bad. Everytime I shop and browse for items, it says unable to connect to server"
Intuitive interface. Fast...
"Flipkart app is the best app available for any shopping site, really easy to use with a great interface and usability. Loved it."
Good app like the interface
Very good interface n navigation
"User interface and design are great. search results are coming good..i purchased flip cover using this mobile app with easy steps... order tracking option also good.. link broken some times with error message  ""unknown error occurred "" need to corrected,otherwise I will give 5 star rating"
That's an awesome app with an amazing interface
"Hello Team, Improve app functionality wise..rather than just user interface So many bug while searching content."
Look into what is spoiling the user experience. Im not able to purchase a selected product.
A lot of error encountered and also the user interface is not that good as the previous one ... Flipkart do consider it seriously as it is one of your shortcomings. . .. Your timely advancement and improvement would be appreciated
Not really  built with user experience.  Hangs in middle of the transaction.

Nice application and user friendly interface for all  New users.
Good app.. Better than  apps of other online stores..  But bit hard to understand the offeres..  Need to improve..  Nice user interface and easy to place order..  Need to improve on the side of comparison of products and reviews
"Too much slow,and no filter option is there,myntra rocks in user interface but due to flipkart's bad ui and inconvenient options i dnt want to buy anything from here"
Finished shopping in just 5mins..its really quick and the interface is very user friendly
Easy to use and understand interface with lively images. No crashes so far.
Shopping  on the go has never been easy... easy user interface . ..
Very easy interface. Fast processing. Well-created categories...
"Easy to use interface. Suggestion : Being flipkart first member, I would want to filter on seller ""WS  Retail"" as one day delivery is offered only on that seller. This would save time and make selection to checkout process faster."
Presentation is beautiful with freindly user interface
Awesome Interface
"Does what it is supposed to, is stable and interface is good. Overall, nice app"
The app does not respond to rotating screen ...it stays in portrait mode despite phone being held horizontally.. Please fix it up for better user interface..
Love the interface. Even better than the desktop version
Its kinda handy... loved the interface.
"Interface is nice, but becoming boring with the course of time..."
"Great app., saves time, data and traffic......good looks mind blowing user interface......"
A good user interface  instead of Web.  Let's you create deals and browse through items with filter in easy way .
every thing about flipy is great.ie from the interface to delivery of things
Cool interface
Good app with intuitive interface. But not able to see my orders from app! Can u fix it?
Very easy interface and swift to shop.
I would say this is the best stop for shoppers with appreciable  customer support plus in time delivery. However one may not get cheap product always but yes Flipkart has special deals and heavy discount quite regularly for customers which are worth to check. Also the interface of the Flipkart website provides a hassle free experience to the customers.
New interface is wonderful.. much stable now.. Thanks flipkart team ☺☺
Superb interface and extremely fast service. Really satisfied.
Easy to navigate & view all relevant info. Excellent user interface
Nice app. Easy user interface.
"very convinient app! love it! The only problem is as product range gets wider, there are too many categories. May be flipkart should leave some categories & concentrate on fewer n bigger categories that will make more business sense & most importantly deliver ""rich'' user experience."
Simple and smooth interface
due to user interface and offers only on the app.
Nice interface
Best thing I liked is the user interface nicely maintained.You can enjoy wonderfull shopping experience.Product image can be improved further with zoom effect or large scale image on click.
good interface and great discounts
Excellent interface

Good user interface but takes lot of time for 2G users. Customers like me living in small town where fast internet is not available makes it much time consuming even to see a product and even payment process sometimes fail due to overtime.
It is a very nice shopping site with user friendly interface with customers.
Very good User interface....
User interfaces should be improve

"Makes life easier,easy to understand interface,good quality images and proper descriptions to commodity....never faced trouble with any product,easy to return policy....loving it!!!!!"
"There is no notification for flipkart app for best deals or any deals for flipkart first subscribers. This has made me miss many flipkart first day offers. Please implement the notifications feature even if the app is not opened, currently the notifications are visible under notification icon when the app is opened which is very bad user experience. Please you can check the myntra and snapdeal app where user doesn't miss the best deals"
Love the interface. Smooth and easy.
very niche interface
Good filters and interface as well
Intuitive user interface.. Easy to navigate. A very well designed app.
Good easy interface.
"Very well designed interface, built with flexibility to keep the shopping experience uninterrupted. Great job guys!"
Awesome User Interface and awesome deals at many prices too.
"Nice interface of flipkart. Makes shopping and browsing easier. However there is a slight disconnect between PC and Application carts. In case purchase is completed on the PC, the App cat doesn't update. Else they are in sync."
The interface nd d shopping system is really fun nd easy. Way 2 go !!!
"Less crap, easy interface. Liked it."
Order easy and fast moreover a better interface... only i wish for a better wishlist view and storage interface...
Interface is good but some of the features are still in developing stage.
Best offers and great user interface
Nice app a mall on phone... Interface is simple and organised
"Depends on Flipkart how they deliver the product, user interface of the app is fine. Unable to find EMI options in the app, Also works slow in 2G speed connectivity."
The app is very good with nice interface and it's bugs free
User interface is good
Nice interface and service lov u guys
Very good user interface
#1 Indian app..... love to purchase in your e-tail..... need a bit more interface improvement.....
Flipkart has not only proved its strength in order fulfillment and quality assurance; but also set standards of what a beautifully seamless user interface should be like....thanks for replicating the graceful simplicity of the site in this app....your UI designers rock !!
Great place for shopping and like the interface of flipkart
Nice app with good interface
Good interface but Tadipatri is not serviceable why? Actually it's a big town in anantapur dist. Try to add this location also.
This is the lightest and fastest app among all e-tailers. User interface and web layout too are awesome.
Nice app bit slow at times but goid interface and nice tools available
"Easy shopping, good deal, btr interface"
VERY BEAUTIFUL INTERFACE. .
I luv the interface very much
Just loved it. Extremely friendly user interface with no bugs. And the mobile app specific offers are like icing on the cake
"The app has features better than ever. Better interface, improved filters and many other features. Flipkart on your service !!"
Very user friendly user interface..good job👍
I just love the simlicity of the interface
Easy navigation.Excellent user interface.
The interface is simple and placing order is a piece of cake!!
Easy to use. Better interface.
Mobile site is forcing to download the app through the interstitial. Forcing users to download app is bad user experience.
"User frndly interface, excellent services, Vast Varied Variety, Best products........   KEEP IT UP FLIPKART TEAM 👌👍👏😊"
"Brilliant app, Easy user interface, hassle free Shopping guaranteed"
Excellent interface.. Very user friendly..
App is good and the interface is easy
Nice interface and easy browsing
"I wonder why Flipkart hired lazy programmers, who did a shoddy job and made this awful app. For starters they could get rid of the webview parts and do some load testing to check up on random lock ups on list pages. Its sad because the app is meant to improve the user experience but only frustrates the user."
Easy and convenient interface
"I know you want us to have a ""supreme"" experience for your website but you don't need to get rid of the web interface for that. That's just not okay... The old saying goes ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"". This is all a conspiracy to have compulsory push notifications to every phone. Greedy business model right there :/"
I will rate 5 star 🌟 for the user interface where it becomes too easier for anyone to choose and select the items:-)
Over WiFi found the app very fast and efficient. They even inform you if prices reduce of products added to cart. The overall interface is very precise and pleasing
Really amazing....Nice interface...brilliant product description........greater improvement than older flipkart app ..Hats off Flipkart...: :-)
Good user experience...
Great app with good interface powered by supreme logistics
Very good user interface!!!!
The interface is nice but pictures are low resolution
Good interface with over all good speed.
Better than opening the website with sleek interface
Easy to use. Clean and simple interface. Love it.

Simple interface even for starters
Awesome user experience
Best interface
Amazing interface
The User interface is good but takes a hell of time to load... Pls fix this issue otherwise it's good
Nice interface and friendly app
India's no1 online shopping app              esay and awesome user interface
The mobile interface of Flip cart is the slowest among all others. I usually order everything from mobile online....and I prefer Jabong for clothing's and similar and Amazon for electronics but there are certain item in flip cart that I like but can't order due to the slow mobile interface. Moreover no special vouchers and offer for frequent users. Need to fine tune. Useless
Improved. Done a impressive job than others. What I like about flipkart is their user friendly interface.
Easy to navigate through the complete range of products. Great interface. Cudos to flipkart team.
"Very good interface, easy to use"
Wide range of items and simple interface .. Great app
Its user interface is really appreciative
App design and user interface is very good. But sometimes app not loading properly in 2G network. Try improve the loading speed in 2G network. I like the WS retail product and they delivered the exact product what we seen in the page.
Great interface
Very well done. Great and intuitive interface. Hassle free purchasing and tracking.
This is awesome app.. User experience is very nice...
"Simple, Great Interface and no connectivity issues.  Apart from that,  it's the normal Flipkart which we all love so much. Their response and initiatives are really good and swift. Deliveries are timely, and mostly, without any glitches"
User interface is nice and it fulfills its purpose as it is quite fast.
"Fantastic user interface,lovely graphics,immediate delivery ,priceless customer support,over all flipkart is a giant and most innovate online shopping App..."
This is one of the most flexible app which can be used to order online. The interface is excellent and quick.
Not a bad one ...not a gud app too... Interface needs to be developed a lot....
great user interface.
"The app works well and I haven't experienced any crashes. But, there have been occasions when the app is unable to connect to the Internet for no particular reason. The interface is good and the payment goes through really smoothly. Though, I feel that the app should have a provision for opening multiple tabs as that would allow us to compare several products at once without closing the page that we're currently viewing. All in all it's a good app and I wouldn't expect anything less from Flipkart."
I appreciate the thought behind the user experience of this app. Very friendly and smooth.
"Well laid out interface and quality deliverance of products,A true trademark of lndia's shopping giant."
Better user interface than Amazon
"Interface is really good, keep it up"
"Interface of the app is nice,product details are adequate in most cases,purchasing and order status checking is super easy. But comparing products is still not available in the app, in some cases product details are not at all convincing for a buyer, besides these occassional crashes and loading product images in even good network conditions is a issue...hope devs resolve these soon..."
"Great interface nice loading , no lags"
Really helpful and easy user interface ##
Very well managed and easy to use interface. All over good. But could improve if they could insert more filtering options and mobile registration for new launching products.
Love the interface!!!
Good interface
Maybe five im facing trouble in user interface.

Very good interface n great offers!
Nice interface
User friendly and easy interface
Loved the interface and the ease of placing an order.
"The flipkart service is great then what the hell with this app.. learn from the snapdeal app. The great user experience.. this app consumes highest amount of RAM , too slow , useless for 2G users. If you want to take compulsion of this app then develope somethig which is usefull for people."
This is very easy to use and have good interface
Easy to use and has a nice user interface.  Ordering is very easy and convenient..
Good interface...ethical dealing. ... Loving it
I liked the tracking in the app and overall interface.
Very user friendly interface....love the app.
This app is working very fast and provide user friendly interface .
The app provides you with excellent online shopping experience. The app's USP is its awesome user interface which makes you want to browse through. This has to be my favorite online shopping app.
"Interface and options available are good, can be improved further"
Very good interface and user friendly.
Great interface. Turnaround time is minimal.
"Well designed, hastlefree simple interface,"
Useless interface
"Great work done on the app. Attractive interface and easy to browse. Well, you could  Lower the prices down a bit though :3 :p"
Intuitive design nice interface
The only shopping site for genuine products. User friendly UI. best mobile interface...
Awesome  User Experience
"This app is very addictive... I used web interface less than 3% of total time spent on flipkart, I don't remember when did I visited shops to buy for those items available on flipkart from last 16 months."
Extremely recommended... Try this before any other app... Great User Interface... Great offers... Great discounts... Everything just great.
Good interface. Could not find EMI option while checkout but probably that is my inability.
"Very simple user interface, easy to navigate and  search by voice option is awesome one.  I could give 5 star but it taking too much time to reach payment gateway. Anyway great job Flipkart Team"
"Love the interface.No issues I have encountered with this app so far.less data, less spce,timly notifications..cool app!"
I must have ordered using the app about 12 times now.  Sure its good as an interface to order.  But it cancels my order and refunds the money every time.  Tried a Delhi address noida address.  It's as if flipkart hates me.  Well Then its mutual.
Its user friendly interface and awesome discount offers makes dis app a big wowww
"Viewing category, particular product, nice interface easy to checkout. Everything is perfect. Awesome app thanks flipkart."
Clean and easy interface.... Bt sum tym it's lags badly...
Very friendly interface and good offers
"its a stupid thing that , you want to install the app in each mobile for surfing Flipkart website. I have this app in my tab but don't want to install in my mobile. but you people not allowing me to browse with chrome ..... !!! disgusting ( Flipkart replayed that it will enhance user experience. OK then you must give the option to switch mobile site. I myself bought more than 100,000 rs of items and also buying from snapdeal too.. these all purchases I made from my laptop. so if you are forcing, I will go.."
Easy to use. Great Interface.
Flipkart app is one of the best app for shopping purposes. Interface is fabulous and you can easily made any mode of payment through this app.
Now search interface is much comfortable with category buttons in the top..saving lot of time..but the sub category tab becomes empty most of the time..please try to fix it
Love the interface . clean  and well organized   Also the app specific duscouts is a very good insentive :p     Good job flipkart !
please check on the internet connectivity code. this looks pathetic to me. user should not keep on pressing refresh button while being on wifi mode. please update this app with a good user experience. thank you.
Smooth interface!!!
I like this application very much and love to browse through it frequently however I have suggestions which will improve user experience even richer. 1) customer should be able to save more then one shipping addrvess. 2)if user buy more then one items and want to ship them in different adress he should be able chose address per item or same address for all the items.3)when user look for any product most frequent or popular brand should be list first in filter criteria. I hope my suggestion help.
Interface cud be improved
I was not too sure to use the app but after downloading i was perplexed by the user friendly interface of the app..... Awesum app design.... Hats off.....  Soo far rocking.... Yet to discover...
Very user friendly and great interface..
Work towards a more userfriendly interface will b appreciated..
I like the app as its a nice interface which makes shopping easier n fun. But there should be an option of alternate phone number for delivery confirmation. As it happened with me that my courier is been returned back due to phone unavailable.
Amazing and best user friendly app. I purchased a mobile and the interface of order sections was very bad.
Shitty user interface both on Android and Windows cannot even access the original website it directs me to the appstore
Smooth interface
Well. It's nice and user interface is also good...I saw other reviews. They say that it forces to download the app. Whats the matter of downloading a 7mb or less app. You have to spare 2 mins for that or even less. Well it a good thing that the loads time are fast. Thanks to flipkart...
Nice interface easy shopping
This app has cool and interactive interface. Feel like keep on browsing it all day.
This is an excellent shopping application.simple user interface and easy to search products.I m using Sony tipo and this app working smoothly.
Good app ..nice interface...
"Awesome interface between a customer and the dealer ,defected product I claimed more than three times even its in the working condition ...best response and I never saw before ..."

Assisted shopping and user interface is good.  Still we want more improvements ☺☺
User interface is not accessible for visually challenged persons.
User friendly interface
Superb interface
The #1 online store with the best mobile interface!!
Best online shopping interface.....
"Filters r not working, slow search, improper new interface"
Nice interface
Awesome interface smooth functioning
The interface of your app is not up to the mark however your service is no less but the interface is lagging behind
The user interface can be much more easier and it's a bit laggye
"Data loads very slowly. Otherwise, it's very nice, specially the user-interface."
"Crashes most of the time while accessing ""My Orders"" and ""Notifications"" back and forth on MotoG2. Connection - WiFi 40 MBPS. Battery life during the issue - 55% Also the app is too slow compared to other similar apps in the market. Fix this issue, otherwise the interface and everything else is good."
The interface is really fast and smooth. Its hassle free and less time consuming from the time you view the the product to the time you actually place the order. I also love the barcode scanner of the app works efficiently and saves time on the typing work.All in all a very good app.
Interface is easy and convenient
"Simply boring user experience, inconsistent UI components. Some of the most important features are missing for example compare feature."
"Great interface, user friendly, cost effective"
Very bad user interface
Great user interface and useful app
Best app award should go to this app. Excellent user interface.
"Just love the interface,  fast and easy to use"
"Very simple interface, like the way you can track the orders within the App."
Very nice interface for the buyer. Love the app!!!!
"Even with the fastest internet connection flipkart takes ages to open and its app crashes very often. If the technical team is listening to this plz make it smoother, we want to buy from you but your interface frustrates us."
The app has a very easy interface for display of products and placement of orders.  Payment process id swift.  Overall good experience!
"Sometimes it is little buggy. Otherwise cool User Interface, fast and sleek. Great service and fast delivery."
Nice interface.
User interface is smooth.. Great offers on aap.. like it..
Great user experience
Its usr friendly and has very good usr interface
Very nice user interface.. No lag what so ever
Perfect interface
Very convenient mobile shopping. Good user friendly interface!
"Worst delivery than any other , it took 15 days to deliver a single flip cover, and the app is very slow and bad app interface it totally irritating to use these app , myntra app is farr better than this and myntra has very fastest delivery than any other online stores in india they take max of 4 days nt 10 or 15 days like flipkart"
A very useful app. Free to do everything. Order or cancel whatever you want in just one click. Love it's easy to use interface.don't know about others but I liked it.
"I have been using the app for a while, my first impression is that there is a long way it has to go. In some cases it crashes for quite a while, some interfaces are simpler and clearer in web, also it does not change orientation when I turn my tablet or mobile. The long and short of it is that app still needs a lot more be desired"
Best app.....easy for interface....fully secured. ..and with best deals
I cant access flipkart on my browser why is that ? And where i have to download app to access the site which is slow anf interface sucks
Good interface
The user interface is quiet light and easy to use ... But the main dissapointment about the app is that it lacks push notifications for the orders placed or even the items in the wishlist. It basically defeats the purpose of a mobile app if one has to manually check the status of orders by opening the app. Add push notifications for pending deliveries and it'll be a 5 star app!
"Was a loyal flipkart customer but hate the app as it keeps spamming with notifications. Had to uninstall it and now flipkart has disabled mobile site. What flipkart calls ""better user experience"" is basically them being able to track and spam their customers better. Shame on you."
Nyc app.!!! With gud interface. !!  :-D
"I understand that you think that it is the best user experience but sometimes users do not wish to have this app when there is a memory crunch. By removing this simple choice, you are driving away possible customers. This kind of coercion is wrong."
Flawless interface
I have been using Flipkart for quite a while now and the kind of deals and products it has to offer is unbeatable. Most importantly the User experience is awesome. Great going guys. You guys have cracked the Indian ecommerce very strongly and you truly deserve to be the best.
"Why is it compulsory to download the app for shopping? I hope you guys are aware that u lose thousands of customers to other websites like amazon or snapdeal coz of this policy of urs. It doesn't make sense for downloading your app and shopping just once in a while, especially for customers like me who shop online not so frequently. In this competitive century, I think not providing sufficient options is equal to losing your customers to a user friendly interface...!!"
Wonderful ap for shopping.. The interface is just awesome..great shopping experience.. A must hv ap for everyone.
Excellent interface
"Hi flipkart. The design of the app does not serve to the visually impaired users. This app is totally unaccessible with the google talk back. The interface of this app Is not user-friendly so many people suffering from the sight problems can not use this app. I request you to kindly bring a better user-interface so people like me can have a better shopping experience. One thing more, I haven't faced any accessibility issues in amazon's and snapdeal's apps. --"
Very nice performance. User friendly interface and easy to use. Gr8 Flipkart. I give you 5 out of 5.
Amazing user interface
"No web interface for mobiles... Apps send lot of ads... Install app, order/browse... DELETE/UNINSTALL"
Good interface. User friendly.
"Have been a Flipkart customer from the beginning. Been using the app since early 2014. It's easy to use, the search function is superb with an excellent intuitive interface. The only feature I would love to have is for the app to connect to my SBI banking app,  so that I can make payments for my purchase without having to generate OTP's for every transaction. Giving it 5 stars!"
The app works great with my redmi 1s. The interface is simple and navigation is easy. Many products don't have a visual description though. Especially in the books section.
Good interface.  Easy use .  Easy to find products.  Great app
Very Simple interface... Easy to shop.
Have been using this app for a few weeks now and I reckon I have seen enough to rate it.     Pros  *Loads very fast  *Crashes are few  *Very convenient interface   Cons  *No facility to limit search of products to only those sellers who ship to buyer's location  *No facility to order search by seller rating  *Product ratings don't show up in search results.
This app is much slower nd the user interface is too much mess. Flipkart wants to switch over only mobile app but failed too build a good app.
Good Interface
Love d way it designed. Smooth interface bt y u keep items at higher price as cmprd to other sites.
Nice and easy user interface. works well.
Offers are good. Interface is nice . great app.
Good interface & user friendly.
Good interface. Great offers. Always up to date. Never lags. I love this app
Very good interface.. Easy to use in comparison with amazon
Simple and easy interface loved using this app
I liked the interface and whatever you want to see can be easily found.....overall very good app
Nice user experience
No use of app or mobile site .....Flipkart app is supposed to be an user interface that should provide hassle free buying and return experience...but Flipkart doesn't do that instead it plays their customer ....I tried exchanging my faulty Asus zenfone but they made me call them four times and the app function for return is not enough for them....they want me to go to their service centre......its an online service site...where is the comfort of buying from home!!
Great interface. Awesome collection
Awesome user interface.try to provide landscape mode interact for both ipad as well as android.
I have to install app to surf on Flipkart!  Btw App has good user interface but lack of speed.
The user interface can be improved and the images can be loaded faster by enabling auto scrolling feature and the voice recognition is not working at all
User interface and products variety is best.
"Good User experience, app wise"
Good interface... easy to surf and order
Its very nice interface
"Very poor interface , too slow . lagging...."
Very gud interface ......very useful...worth shopping on it
Amazing User Interface
The interface is very friendly and meaningful suggestions based on history do help a lot
Has a cool user interface. 4 stars coz u people will continue like dis
Nice interface
"You guys need to make the app run faster ... A lot faster! On Airtel 3G the pages open slowly. Often the required content takes minutes before it gets displayed. User experience gets a big halt there I suppose. I m using Nexus 4, 5.1 Lollipop."
Nice interface than other similar purpose applications.
Very user frndly and gr8 interface!! All the orders placed from the app are immediately updated on the website!!!!
Very easy interface
The best user interface i have ever experienced.
Forcing users to use the app instead of your mobile site is another poor decision in your history of poor decisions. Let the user decide which interface they prefer.
Great interface. Easy to use Amazing deals everyday. Just loving it
"Interface is quite nice. Buying products is easy. Another suggestion is to add the compare feature in the App itself, comparisons with 3/4 similar products may be suggested at the bottom of the listing page itself."
Very good and easy to use interface
Awesome interface and good usability makes Flip kart the best in all shopping sites.
"Thanks for this app. I am using it on Moto g 1st gen with Android 5 Lollipop. No lags. However, an UX suggestion. While loading images, instead of message "" loading data, please try after some time"", it is much better to show ""loading data, please wait."" Current message has negative impact on user experience. Thanks..."
The interface is good.... But it work slowly.... Is hight speed 3G also....and also hang hang hang hang hang hang hang hang hang all the time....
Superb interface
What a interface!!
Still needs to be more optimized...  lags many of times although interface is pretty good. Overall i wud say NOT BAD
Saves time..good interface..
Nice interface and accessibility
"Loved the interface, daily deals, app specific deals & quality of the products. Maintain this and keep rocking."
User interface should be change goods comparing should be more easy it takes lot of Time and adding the goods also soo difficult
"Good interface, easy to search and order."
Amazing interface and simplicity!!
Better interface and use than competitor's
"Loved the desktop interface, its a bit tricky in the app but then kudos to have almost all in the app as well except for a few things. Try to get them on the app as well"
Awsome interface..
Easy to Navigate and Nice interface.
"Definitely an improvement over what it was a few months back in terms of performance, user interface and detailed information. App experience needs to get more close to the desktop browser experience with every subsequent update."
Clean interface.
Its simply better than its competitors in terms of user friendly interface and also product pricing.
Reliable-quick-awesome interface.
"Smooth operation, intuitive interface"
User friendly interface
I think its cheaper to buy by this app and interface is very nice and now I dont need to search the web.. cool
Interface quite mediocre
Cool Deals and user Interface is also good.
Please activate your website or else it's pretty sure you will loose market.The interface is not user friendly and clumsy.
Good user interface. Easy to use  good app for low specification devices also
Amazing interface. Loving it.
Really good and user friendly interface with minimum lag..
Very good app with awesome interface
"One of the best application interface for e-com mobile apps in India. But unable to rate and review products, had send a mail to customer support as well but no update has been done."
Good and nice interface.
Best interface and app among all!
I like the overall usability of the app and user experience. However i daily get lot of notifications. But i tried to find a way to disable them but could'nt locate it. It should be user preferance to receive notifications or not like any other app.
Really enjoy the use interface... Keep coming with new updates to keep it interesting...
Nice user interface and fast connectivity...
Interface should be changed. When you filter d items u lukin for it doesn't really show . developers y don't u make it something like Myntra app which is very friendly n nice. Dis is d opinion of my entire family.
Nice interface and easy to use. Loved it!!
Easy-to-use interface and the best possible way to shopping.
Works fine for me with a great interface
"Awesome app, user friendly interface works great very fast but it takes time to load in low end android version & phones and sometimes it even crash and need start again. Please optimize app for lower end devices  Add fadvantage option to sort fadvantage products and can checkout easily"
Love the interface and the products keep it up guyzzzzz!!!!!!
Nice clean interface
Very easy to use and user friendly interface
The interface is clean enough to get the product of your choice. Good job Flipkart. App speed can be increased more or else it will be a five Star rating.
I'm not a great fan of your yellow dominating interface. I'm sure your designers had a good reason to choose that color. The interface looks a little cluttered and can use some breathing space.   I care less for the UI when the prices that you guys offer are the best. You also have a large collection of items. I'm going to stick to you guys for a long time.
Not a very responsive user interface. Product listing needs to be further made user friendly.
"The new user interface of this app is simply amazing.With its prompt delivery and genuine products,Flipkart has earned the place it deserves in the online marketing industry."
User friendly interface. Easy to use. Well done.
Perfect shopping app with very good user  interface.
Just loved the interface and the speed. U guys doing a great job.
Nice app.. Cool interface.. Love it!!
Good user experience on the App features and its filtering options per product/category.
User experience in using this app is great
Dont even think of downloading..app takes much time to load even in 3g netwrk.bad interface.
Awsum app...!!! Too good !!! Hassle free...!! Great interface
The new user interface of this app is simply amazing
Nice application for purchase. Very nive interface and quick!!!
Good interface
Atleast they respond to people's issues and fixes it.But still there are users with limited internal memory so it's still a not a completely 'right  way' to improve user experience.
Hi I just updates Flipkart app. Of course they have improved the user interface but there is a bug in it. You cannot access ur profile page r u cannot see ur order status as u cannot go to the order screen ...I wish they could fix this asap... By the way I am using moto g
It's a app with clean interface.....
Good filtering facilities to choose the products and good interface too
Good Application...But the interface and app logo should be changed in a particular time period...
Nice update n better user experience.
A good & compact app but still improvements can be done on the interface.
"I like the new interface ! And the searches are relevant the buttons are slick , everything is just good and the ui glides smoothly. The app Is also very user friendly 😆"
Material design for shopping app...! Amazing user experience.. Other sites should follow..
"Using the app for quite sometime without any problems. Intuitive interface, simple app design & smooth process flow."
"App is good ,nice interface but one problem & i.e there is no option to select products by  flipkart advantage"
Nice interface and easy to use
The app Interface is excellent. The Quality has improved a lot but takes more time to load. In 3G networks it may be fine but for the majority using 2G it is an issue.
Easy to use ..nice interface ..:)
Loved it has a clean and user friendly interface
Faster Loading and Good user interface.
Interfaces is very good
I found the interface and experience of using this app moderate.
I love this app. Nice user experience. This is well ahead amazon eBay apps.
Other app are working fine than flipkart...need to change the userinterface
Well designed and better interface!
An app with one of the easiest user interface...
Very nice n user friendly interface. Suggestion: kindly provide us option to filter out of stock and undeliverable products. Provide a filtering option 'Flash/Torch' in all mobile phones/Tablets. Also provide improtant features of produch in Main Product page n list page also it should be mentioned that the product is deliverable or not.
Interface is gr888.... Details authored nicely for best shopping experience...
I am using a mi4 handset and old app worked like a charm..the new app looks and feels good but when i try to check out any item the images dont load most of the times and smtimes when it loads its damn slow..its kinda worsening my user experience...hope u guys can fix it soon
The best user interface compared to all other .
Good app for on the go buy.  Cool user interface
User Interface
Better interface.. nice shopping experience
Very good user interface
Really like the app and the easy to use interface.
Best way to browse Flipkart on smartphones. Good interface and smooth navigation makes this app deserve perfect 5.
New User interface
Interface not fluid enough... Intelligent pocketing of categories not there... Still its good...
In payment page it is showing only text. No graphical interface while payment.
I liked the app and the user interface of it. Allows the users to scroll easily and choose the product.
I am using this app for long...really love the interface and service from the flipkart
I liked the new interface but it could have been better.
Excellent interface.  Spot on searches and product description.  A must have app.
Interface is best then others online shopping app.
"Latest version lagging behind compared to previous versions. Scope of development is there, but nice interface."
Nice interface. Neatly designed. Great
User interface is really awesome!!!
Awesome app. Simply Love it's user friendly interface which makes it easier to use!!! Hope flipkart continues like this!!!!
Beautiful app.....such an easy interface...i love it
"The latest upgraded version which has a better quality interface has lost its quality in terms of connectivity. Whenever I click on ""Buy Now"" button or ""My Orders"" option, it prompts a message saying ""Flipkart cannot be reached"" and then automatically it goes back to the home screen. Please fix this issue because its getting very difficult to make purchases. Due to this issue I am compelled to make my purchases through other e-commerce apps."
"Liked the new layout, it's good to see a better design on the user interface... Best among the online shopping apps"
Amazing interface and offers
Great user experience
Effective interface
Me being a customer of flipkart from 2years.. Would recommend every one to shop through flipkart - Amazon is good as well - But I shop mostly from this particular ecommerce website . The app is handy and very user friendly as well. Yes the app do uses a lot of data but being a smart phone user one should have idea how much data an interface like that or the images provided by the app (being of high resolution) may use.. Till date I had no issues with flipkart and for that I am leaving a wise feedback.
Good user experience.
"Very user friendly, prefer the desktop version more. But full points to the user interface and quick check out options."
I am gonna give 4 star now. The interface of app is not that smooth. Amazon has the worst and snapdeal is the best. But still I love flipkart though I purchase a lot from Amazon due to less price in lots of items as compare to flipkart.
Easy to use interface.
Nice Interface !
Great interface
User experience isnt really smooth. The filters are not full proof.. search also seems to be buggy.. desktop version is any day better.
"Quicker and faster interface, good work team."
Love the interface and ease to buy
Good interface.
User interface is nice...
Lovely app good interface.
Frequent and smooth interface
"There are no questions about flipkart....This app is cool,nice interface and fast."
Can easily navigate nd interface is very cool.
I just love to open the app again and  again and check the numerous deals that flipkart has to offer.... a great user experience along with a handy UI makes this app easy to use....
Nice interface..
Has a good new user interface
Nice n easy user interface. Company has good polices for customers
Nice! The new interface is good.. And delivery is fast..
This app is little bit laggy... Of  course I am using low end moto e. May be because of that. It'll be appreciated if u improved the interface a bit smoother...
So user friendly app Interface is really great Thanks to flipkart
I love the interface and search options are so cool...  And getting more offers on app.. Thanks to flipkart
Not good interface
User interface like refining men and women categories could have been better...
The interface is good but can't turn off notifications. So I had to manually turn all notifications off from task manager. So I won't get even relevant notification till I open the app again. That is very inconvenient
This app's interface is better than Amazon app.
Like it. Nice interface
Very slow.. And images not up to the standard required... Myntra app has much better user interface...
Its awesome.. Very fast and interface is very kool...
Good Interface
Nice user interface
"Pretty good app  , nice interface , easy to use, quick and handy.  But the app takes a lot to run on 2g ... It's good only on 3g or Wi-Fi . Please make the app a bit lighter with lesser power consumption and effective data usage . Thankyou."
Very good user interface
Although the app is excellent and the interface is also user friendly but I guess the size of this app is a bit heavy and it takes time to open and many times a msg pops up saying u don't hav a internet connection try again after some time (I use 3g)....
Very good interface and easy to use
Nice app!preety handy at times and a good interface!!!
"Wonderful app, beautifully designed, clean interface so its easy to use."
Nice interface...slight lagging..managable
"Simple interface, would like it better if u could make it easier to increase the quantity of the same product.. It took me a while to figure it out. Great offers recently by the way.. Keep em sales coming n expect more 5 stars.."
Good to see Flipkart provides much better interface than giant Amazon.
nice interface
Very useful. And a great interface after the new update
interface is nice and manu is easy to find... and offers are awsome!
Attractive interface
The app is great with user-friendly interface. But the biggest problem with this e-commerce is that they give an expected delivery date for the items that are ordered and this date is not at all true. You must give the correct delivery date so that the customer plans accordingly. If you are delivering earlier than the date which u gave to the customer you must call them beforehand. Suddenly out of nowhere you get an SMS that your product will be delivered by today before 7pm and then you have no idea.
The yellow interface  was good then the present blue
Nice interface but surely need to create checks for genuine sellers
"Waste.  Please improve below points if you can. 1- app is very heavy and login is specially irritating.  We need simple interface.   2- your site and app so many time goes for unexpected errors. . What you mean by unexpected first. 3- offers on flip cart doesn't make any sense. If you want hit on you app then you can go for others ways also, please don't make fake promises.  Prices of items were same everywhere and on all sites. 4- you guys are not proving clarity on replace and return. Now don't have words"
U will find variety of collections here.. User experience is also damn good compared to other apps.. And u can find killer deals too
Simply love the App.The ease with which one can glide through menus and sub menus are simply thoughtful.A lot of commen sense has gone into creating the  Application and this application is Air-tight and cuts no corners..The user experience very very satisfying.Great work Flipkart
Great user experience app. Everything needed is at just there. No launch of new app for transaction.  :)
Easy and quick.  Still a lot room on improving the user experience
There is an message over the interface saying created with sketch.. What to do then? It is not allowing me to see what I want to..
Good app.  Interface is good
Interface is good. User friendly..
Negatives: 1. App is too slow.  2. Delivery is bit late than the others.  3. Dnt hav Mach options for faster delivery.  4. Scope for improvement  in interface.
I like the flipkart app.. Has been designed good for a great  user experience
Fantastic app with good user interface
The interface is nice but the app is very heavy
Convenient and easy user interface
Easy interface ..
Ok app. But user interface needs improvement
Too slow..... Worst user interface....
"I switched over from moto g2 to galaxy a5 and since then the app home page is not loading  (not even once), if I am directly searching an item some times it responds but most of the time not. And home page not loading even once. Throughly disappointed. Yours user interface of the app was best amongst the rest but you ruined it. Please restore my faith."
Best interface among peers.
Nice user interface
User interface is not gud
Application interface can be improved much more
Nice interface. Customer support never helps. Irritating.
"Best app all from Amazon, Snapdeal,     Shopclue. Has great UI. well define User experience. 5 out of 5 love the app"
Really nice app n user Interface also good.
Very fast download. User friendly interface and menu. Categories are updated quickly. Placing orders is hassle free. Prompt delivery.
"Nice app , but the filter options can be improved . But the user interface is awesome."
"Although I am not a big fan of Flipkart(loves Amazon), but one thing is sure that if you compare apps of both companies, Flipkart is way better in interface and performance than Amazoz..... I wish Flipkart to increase its Customer Centric Attitude like Amazon."
Smooth interface.. Good app
Amazing user experience.
I experience a problem whenever I shop through this app that whenever I search for a product the price that it usually displays at first is less but whenever I click on the product to open the product interface suddenly its price soars high as much as it could be. So this problem is really needed to be assessed & fixed quickly as possible.
User interface is so scintillating and user friendly. About prices this is worse because flipkart puts all prices exorbitant .... Also main defect is every single product in whole cart charges shipping charges ...Not Recommended
Brilliant interface. Neatly designed and well categorized products.
"This app defines the shopping experience in a new way.Earlier,people hesitated to shop through mobile apps.But this app ,with its simple and user -friendly interface,redefines the shopping experience through mobile platform.But flipkart should look into their logistics especially in tier 2 or tier 3 cities.Ours is Kalyani,a small,beautiful town, 53 km(apprx) away from Kolkata.But most of the products(except mobile and a few electronic goods )from yours are not shipped here."
Fast and easy interface..
Great user interface. Only star deducted for unwanted notifications and some fixed filter options
The new interface is amazing
Awesome UI and user experience
Easier way to shop than the website interface.
Bad user interface
I think flipkart is way ahead of Amazon in terms of user experience and its amazing how they fit in all that the customer needs in a 6 inch screen !
Flipkart is a very good app and very trustful site.. User interface is a more helpful to easy purchasing.. Excellent product 'delivery' also!
Pretty good interface and good service overall. What would make it perfect? Being able to Review the purchased product.
It's a far way better than amazon app. The design team is really giving great USER INTERFACE.  more over pls keep rocking.  I just love it people.  Kind suggestions that it would be nice if there is funny message for error or server unreachable. Currently its having some wired red color text.  Cheers :)
I liked this app and it's interface and easy to use. Only I need more transparency in after sale support and payment transaction.
Nice interface.....
"It's a very convenient app for shopping, great interface must say"
"So while all other apps work perfectly on my network this particular app always shows error and say plz try after some time. Three days since I downloaded it but have been able to browse through just once. Otherwise, its friendlier than the website. Really liked the interface."
It is a cool app that comes with a unique and friendly interface.
Best interface of all those shopping apps
"App is good, easy to place order. I would still want to have the web interface available as searching become easy on web on a bigger screen"
Loved the app and interface
I guess Flipcart tech team has made the app with a lot of study on user experience and the interface which is too good. 5 stars to entire Flipcart team.
User interface is really good and cool. Making few changes will be path breaking
Good interface but not great.
Great Interface! Easy to search and order.
I m a shopaholic person... this app has changed the way I shop...truly amazing...this app helps me to shop anytime anywhere with an easy user interface.. Flipkart services are too good... long range of branded products..now shopping is at my convenience... I would like to suggest one addition in the UI..it would be great if I have a choice to group my wishlist products according to some criterias.. which will help me to re search my product faster ...Thank u..amazing work done....
Best online shopping site and user interface
The desktop app is way more convenient. The user interface is not very good. The only reason to use this app is that there are more offers on select products
With this update problem of crashing has been solved...Thnx technical Team Flipkart...loved this app and its interface.
"The new update has an amazing interface, simply loved it. The new picture search option and similiar products suggestion, this is excellent indeed. Great app and greater fun is the shopping experience. Good Work Team Flipkart. 👍"
Very good user friendly and clean user interface. Nice app.
"I was in for a shock. This app consumes so much data. The website is way better. The mobile app sucks big time, the interface is not anything like the website. Just one word 'Disappointed'. Please make the app as good as the website."
Cool application. Good products at best price. Easy to use interface and easy real time tracking of products
"Flipkart is awesome by default. I've been using it for years. However, this review is about the app, and i have no problem with it either! The interface is easy figure out and use. And oh, i live in thane and shipment here is really fast. Go Flipkart!"
Very good impressive interface
"Amazing app interface,  please keep it updated with more features."
Improved interface.
Awesome interface along with fantastic customer service team. No doubt it's the  last word in the online shopping business. Keep up the good work. You guys rock!
"Liked the app, interface and ease of use. Would you please move the logout button to main menu?"
Easy to use user interface . Fairly reasonable range of products . Good service . Loved the app
"Don't be that disparate for ur Android apps TRP.. if its a flop then try to improve it rather then wasting ur time to find cheap initiative ways to force ur users to download it.. Well, not everyone has enough space on their mobile or maybe they dislike ur app or maybe data plan issue coz this is the only country where u get 1GB of 2G Data for min 150bucks on 16kbps downloading speed.. Guys who want to open flipkart on android browsers TRICK: choose desktop interface to load the websites on the Browser.."
Super user interface feels to use in an more convenient way.
Nice user interface all is ok but it take more time to load even connected to 2g network ..foreground data connection problem.........background data connect app automatic but foreground taking load.......please look at this matter its all user's problem about connectivity to app
This one interface is really better...
Forcing Phone user's to install App over official website is ridiculous and bad idea. What if a person needs to quickly check the price of some random product for comparing to other online shoping sites. Voila! it says go install the app. I gave 2 stars for App interface. I could have given 4 only if i could have access to site from Phone's Browser.
"Overall a smooth app but the problem is that you don't see your cart in between browsing stuff on the app. This needs to be fixed as its a hassle going back to the home page. Which reminds me that there is no home page button too. Things that are good is the ability to set filters accurately, zoom in etc and the user friendly interface. But if you are making flipkart ""app only"" you better get the app right."
"Older versions were far more accessible & interface was easy too.. This new update is very immatured.. WOULD HAVE GIVER ""-5"" STARS IF I HAD THAT OPTION..."
"Completely satisfied with the interface, speed and convenience. Deserve those 5 stars"
Nice user interface.. Occupies less space.. Works great in slow network.. I love this app thanks for shifting only in mobile app.. 😘
Interface isn't the smoothest here.. Images do get clustered and browsing becomes a little. Difficult sometimes.. This is especially evident on lower end android devices
Easy user interface
"I like the functionality, but I found the web interface easier to use with its wide spaces (less scrolling). The app doesn't seem to have the shortcut of clicking on a home button to go back to the main page yet. So if you did a couple of search results, going back one by one in reverse chronological order is a pain. The flipkart logo (shortcut to home) should ALWAYS be on top. In addition, I saw that the sort by price function wasn't working properly in some instances..  Minor nitpicks overall.."
Its ok to give customers a smooth platform for transactions by app.and service of company is quiet good.But still use of website is convenient and preferable by many people.maybe because it was way better than app.upgrades and fixes needs to be done on this app's user interface!
Great interface
Nice GUI interface keep it up.
App interface is not good. It can't track orders exactly like web browser
Very good interface....no lags seen!!
Gives good user experience......
Love the interface and the ease of navigation on the site. Great job
Application is really good and easy to interface
Very good & easy interface
Good user interface...
"Overall the app is good. The latest app has navigation issues to home screen. Once I search multiple times in search window, there is no option to directly go to home screen of flipkart app. I ve to keep pressing backbutton until all the history of search is scrolled back.  Fk team please fix this.  I see even other users reported this and its very annoying user experience"
Good interface. Quick loads.
Bit more importance on user experience would have been better
The interface is awesome. Loved it! :)
Going to the app could be a option but forcing to install the app is not good.  At least others are still providing a mobile interface.  The app takes up space and runs in the background.  Need to install it every time I install a new Os.  Please look at providing a mobile interface.
Nice interface and food products to choose from..
its really too good interface
Worst user interface. .. web brower mode is much friendly..too clumpsy...dosent show the desired product on searching
The best part is that the interface if the best amongst *all* the shopping apps .... Its user friendly and helps me find things out easily
This app have the best user experience.. I m njoying it.
"Need to improve user interfaces, its not that user friendly as other s"
"Very convenient user interface..howeevr deliveries can be faster for apparels, bags and cosmetics."
"Flipkart has kept working on their interface in d app but m suprised that you'll still haven't realised that in d case that we view a product n den navigate to multiple products hence, there is no way to go back directly to home but to keep pressing back till you finally do reach there. Yes there is an home option in d side menu....which can again only be acessed when yoour on d home screen....defeats the purpose completely!"
No gr8 user interface
Your app only method kills me to use your portal. I was able to easily buy/search a product in mobile website but now I can't even able to search a product at the initial level with your app. Flipkart app = F*** app. May be your IT team is working for your opponent company to downgrade your brand value. Reopen your mobile website otherwise it will leads to a huge loss for your company...not for the customers. Because we will easily migrate to other ecommerce website where we find a good user interface.
This is the app who are properly interfaced.
But can be better on user interface
I really like this app and its user friendly interface
#greatapp#greatproducts#bestmobileshoppingapp#easiertosearch#nicelookinginterface#shoppingfun#goodshoppingcatalog#toomanyhashtags
User interface is great
Covers all aspects of flipkart and extremely user friendly with amazing User Interface
"not better than myntra interface,but ok"
Nice user interface but takes time in loading.
Interface is really good. Large size shoes also available but stuff like lubes and timers for rubik cube not available. Also a dayan zhanchi stickered I brought was not upto the mark. But overall really good. Prefer it over amazon.
Amazed by the the user interface the the speed of loading the content and the new features
"interface is good . but app need high speed internet , i think that is a problem ,thats y i hate it"
"Yesssss! I love it  , it provides very user friendly interface,good quality products ,good timely delivery , ...."
Liked it but it can be improved to give a better user experience...
App is amazingly cool loved the interface of app
Best indian online shopping app. It has user friendly app interface with no glitch. Trusted products with a wide range of collections. Must have app for every smatphone.
"Great and easy user interface. Works great, almost like a website. I am happy with this app. But it changes notification settings automatically, which I dont like."
Amazing interface......
Excellent ui interface
Can't compare products and Flipkart does not allow access to the web page from my mobile device. Prefer their web interface way more.
I have been a user of this app for the past 2 years. What I observed is that there has been a drastic improvement in the user interface. The app doesn't get hanged after the bug fixes. A suggestion from my party would be possibly to add more filters while searching in the electronics department.
Clean interface.
Excellent interface
nice and intutive interface
Best app in this category both in terms of product quality and service quality. And also very good interface.
"Cleaner user interface, better usability and almost no crashes whatsoever."
Best user experience among all alike apps.
The interface is user friendly and clear.
"Very good interface, wonderful shopping experience"
Very slow to load and the interface is worst.
"It's an excellent app but bit slow for fast user interface. Getting hanged many time; improve or sort out this bug for more comfortable usage. Overall experience excellent & satisfied,  keep it up guys !!"
Good interface with the user
Much better than any other shopping app...well designed and well arranged and sorted products... ONLY PRODUCTS WORTH BUYING ARE WS RETAIL...AND FEW OTHERS..vrest are nothing more than risk :-|......But app is app...small screen interface with products....so don't shut website... WE WANT WEBSITE TOO 😬   WE CAN'T GIVE REVIEW THROUGH AN APP.. ALTHOUGH WE CAN READ REVIEWS OF OTHERS
Please improve my order area in the app... Its very basic interface and less information.
"Loved the interface,Love the feel of app and love the fact that I am spoilt for choices....Just two complaints....More often than not the quality of footwear sent from branded suppliers doesn't come right at the first go.....I mean defective product...which do get changed....Secondly.....Hate it when you showcase a good product at cheap/discounted rate and add ridiculously high delivery charges....That's not fair :("
Love the interface and ease of use..
Flipkart app is as amazing as the brand itself. User interface could be worked upon (see Myntra app for reference). Perhaps more offers/ privileges for the flipkart first subscribers?
"A great user interfaced application, I loved it"
Can improve user interface
"Really awesome way of accessing a Really awesome place! Nice looking interface with lots of features that make shopping a breeze, not to mention all the great offers!"
The great thing is the app only offers. It's a great shopping app with a great user interface.  You should definitely go for this.
Makes life so much easier...shopping is actually in ur hands reach! Clean and trendy interface...good going!
Awesome interface..... so user friendly... in one click u will get right product...
easy and good interface.
Nce interface
A good interface with most details given simple and clear.
"Dear developer, why do you need to have all information about the phone ? I am sure it's not needed for user experience. Uninstalled.."
"You guys have got the interface spot on. Really simple to use. Only thing missing are the customer reviews. If you add that, you'll earn that 5th star 😀"
"Love the user friendly interface. Offers can be seen clearly, filters and sorting are also easy to use"
Nice app for shopping. Very easy interface. Perfectly categorised.
"Though I have not explored all of the features yet, liked the interface and navigation. Cool features and very responsive too!"
"I wd rather spend some time in my laptop as this flipkart app is horrible in terms of user interface,snapdeal and amazon have way better apks than this.. Why should I waste my time to compose a formal mail to your team,dear sir, by profession m a software tester of India's one of the largest IT firm. And by that way,u r quite lucky to have my comments out here.u should send me a formal mail to know more details."
"Flipkart is losing its worth since it started adding new sellers,  degrading services n now this app...  Its quite a bad interface with stupid offers listed..  I use site n if i find ny better deal on app for the product shortlisted,  i use app...  Else dis app is of absolutely no use...  If flipkart decides to go app only,  dey wud lose customers like me"
Great interface
U made a mistake here by deciding to shut down the site and going with  the app. App can never give me the rich user experience of a website.
"One of the better apps amidst the plethora of e-commerce apps. possible to sorts, browse and select products with ease. Haven't used the ping function yet, since i believe i have other communication medium available. Not too sure why I need another application to interface with the same guys even if it means leaving the app; but then that's just me. Overall I am quite happy with the app.  Can you guys try imagining a different UI and design that will liven up things on a 5"" screen.."
Love the new user experience. It helps me find things on the go and order them. So reliable application for online purchase. I do recommend this app to all friendz.
Loved the new interface...
"They are trying something new like ping n shake to share n all, but these features makes its interface buggy"
The interface looks very sad and boring
Notification gone but still lags a lot. The interface is not smooth as compared to apps such as snap deal and amazon.
"Better speed n smoother interface on app compared to using mobile browser, faster and well customizable."
Dream new interface and bound to get better. Love the prices and ease of shopping.
"Good clean interface, efficient and easy to use. No problems with the app whatsoever."
User friendly interface
The interface of the app is good and we can easily place the order through the app.
Nice experience. With this app I purchased lot of things of both good n bad quality. But bad quality can be returned quickly n easly. Use friendly n good interface.
"Gd interface, but can do better."
Nice app and very user friendly interface.keep it up guys!
This app promises to be great as launches but user interface is not good for us. E.g. we can't contact the sellers easily. It should be a lot easier but like this.
Just love it! Easy user interface with lots of things! good job keep it up
Very bad user experience. It has cost you the rating.
it don't work well on 2G network moreover is very badly interfaced.
Good interface
Good interface to explore all the products. But only thing needs improvement that delivery time. Sometime time it says weej but delivered in few days.
"I believe we can actually move from being a slouch to ""on the go"" kind. The interface is as supple as it gets. Minor improvements on the speed maybe, still better than the gauntlet of competitive .coms !"
Gud app nice and easy user interface.
Love the interface!
The visual interface is good and its easy to use. Nice one
"The app is very good.. The presentation and the user interface is very good.. Flipkart has maintained its reputation of good customer service, be it's delivery of goods or after sales service both are excellent.. HOWEVER PLEASE DON'T INFLATE A PRODUCT'S PRICE TO AN UNBELIEVABLE AMOUNT AND READJUST THE PRICE TO SHOW THAT YOU ARE GIVING A HUGE DISCOUNT... WE BUY PRODUCTS FROM YOU NOT BECAUSE OF DISCOUNTS BUT, BECAUSE OF THE SERVICE AND TRUST THAT YOU PROVIDE US.... Please stop manipulating the price tags..."
"Dead slow after recent updates, though better interface. I liked it better earlier and hate everyday updates."
"I want to ask you one thing,why have you disabled Flipkart for browser users.Even now,where many have smartphones,they don't like to install any extra app which can led to extra storage.When one can do the same thing in the browser,why to installed it forcefully.I know,you want to make the user experience smooth but if one to get that experience he 'll download an app.Even one doesn't get that much usability in browser,atleast he could search and make the purchase. Let you left it on the user to decide."
Love the interface. Placing an order wasn't easier than now. :)
Flipkart is very good online shopping website but now a days they don't provide shopping even Form PC or Web browser. New app only strategy of flipkart is very bad and limiting user experience.
Fantastic interface developed by flipkart. Makes you go on shopping spree. ..
It does provide user friendly interface which makes online shopping very easy
Beats Amazon heads up with this beautiful interface
Love the new app interface and needless to say about flip kart and it's service as everyone out here knows it's one of the best in customer service and quality.
"User interface is good and easy to use,  Ping is a nice addition"
Need better interface
"Wonderful service, awesome interface, before time delivery. What else u want in life.accessed the products without crashing of this application."
Hangs many times. Also the coming sale as app only is real bad move. Already have stopped purchasing from myntra from day it became application only. Also flipkart prices are always high. 99% shopping I do from amazon. Also had bad experiences before in returns where I had to courier myself from prime city and refund of courier charges as 800 Rs was only by wallet and could by products only by ws retail. Bad move. Before few years only used flipkart but now dislike the service and user experience and costin
"I think you should continue with the website. I don't want to install the app because I might just be browsing the catalog to check out the price offerings for the product. If I choose not to install the app I shouldn't be forced to. Please don't post a reply promoting seamless user experience. I'm a software engineer and I know how websites work. It's quite possible to create a website with a smooth, non lagging, user experience. Please try and get the website up."
"Best Online Shopping App with User Friendly Interface, Options and Filters!! Best offers and discounts!! BigBillionDay is the best!! Nice Shopping Experience!! Great job for the app as well as Flipkart as a whole!!"
Good easy interface
Smooth and highly user friendly interface.. Searching and filtering is also awesome
Most irritating interface ever. Older version was better.
My mom's addicted to your app. And I love shopping with you guys too. Only draw back of the app. You could work on the interface make it more user friendly. And let us update our new email id's in same profile we use.
Out of stock is not indicated correctly. Items are in stock and when I tried to place order It throws error during shipping address selection and payment. When contacted the customer care they are saying that the product is out of stock. Interface is not fluidic. Website is far better. I hate using this app.
Bakwaas!!! Worst interface. Sometimes images doesn't open in 'my order' section and sometimes it shows no internet connection.
It is fast. User experience could be better. It is too cumbersome
Interface can be made a bit less sensitive...still prefer desktop versatility
"There was a time when Flipkart was the only app that offered smooth search and user interface. Now, competitors are updating their apps and making it better. Whereas, Flipkart is becoming laggy and quite unattractive. Poor!"
"The best user interface and products are show cased nicely, easy classification of products, search option works perfectly fine."
Very smooth and lag free user interface. Delivery is also good and on time.
Loved the app user experience
Need a little improvement in user interface
Flipkart is embedding its app with all new awesome features like ping and cam search.  The interface is user friendly and enjoyable and of course not to forget the great app offers.  Bravo flipkart!
It's amazing. The interface is simple everything is handy
App is smooth. Interface is good. But faced issue while selecting multiple payment modes. After applying egv was not able to choose net banking. Had to pay with credit card. And seems like response time has increased. This needs improvement.
Excellent search list and user experience
Shopping @flipkart is the best... Awesome app with great interface with ease ..nd ofcourse the products here are genuine nd trustworthy.... Luv it man....jst keep it up..nd keep going...
User friendly interface.
Nice user interface
Friendly interface and using
Viewing and purchasing products are easy. Online payment is also secure. The interface is very good and makes it easy to find products. 5/5 stars. :)
Best User Interface ever seen in a shopping app.Barcode Scanner is missing a bit worrying info
"This review is solely based on the app interface and not on the shopping experience. My orders, wishlist sections cannot load up most of the time. While checking out an order it gets stuck in the all important payment section. Please fix it."
Nice offers on app and very nice user interface
Best products with proper technical assistance..n easy interface 2 swipe for loved products..
"Superb interface , No lagging..  I totally love it."
Need to improve on User experience.
Nice software interface
I have updated this app and the new interface is cool
Very gud user interface..i loved it
Easy shopping and appreciable user interface. Loved shopping on flipkart.
Much faster and the interface is just awesome
"Good app,nice work...easy to use..nice user interface..."
Better interface and fast too but I am not able to register my self to ping
Excellent user interface and filtering
"No way to get back to your previous search/filters. Irritating notifications. Is ""Ping"" a joke? Extremely inferior experience to the web interface."
Great app..very fast and easy to buy all at one place. Fast interface helps in quick buy...@ best price..@ quality
"Loved the update recently brought up in the app, size has been reduced, ping option, better interface"
Great interface.
The application has an awesome interface and usability
The interface of the app is awesome. Its a fun browsing different items. Ping is a very good feature. Always get full specs and details about the product
Interface is great. Its user friendly. But.. It crashes sometimes.. Rest everything is good.
Great user experience
nice interface
Best interface that makes u browse more n more n ultimately shopppp
One of the best apps in shopping category. The products are sorted in relevant categories and can be filtered easily. Payment and return policy is also smooth and clear.  All these combined with a light weight interface. I would say its easier to search in app than on web.
It does not show my orders moreover the interface is too slow
Options like compare and review (which are available on web app) are missing on this mobile app. We generally search and inspect products on the web app then order from mob app (because there are more discounts here). This takes time and products become out of stock quickly. So my user experience is not that great using this app. It could be better.
Great interface and superb offers....
Nice app and interface but navigating under sub categories is pain when I need to find something specific
I find the desktop interface easy to use .. App is a waste of my memory
Nice app interface loved it and also i got rs 100 voucher 👌👍❤
User interface is easy to operate.
It's provides a good user experience
Because its flipkart! But a multi tab interface would have been better.
Value For Money. Good Customer Care Services and Interface. Thanks Flipkart
has quite a smooth interface
Good interface
Awesome interface & very fast
Thanks for fixing the EGV interface in mobile
Good interface and service
Only in terms of interface good. But I think if they do not return items like full money back like amazon its not going to work..
Nice interface
The user interface is much better than other e-commerce apps. It is pretty convenient.
Most user friendly interface....ease of shopping....with great deals....
"I love small details in any app and flipkart app took appreciably nice care of these small details like nice interface,ping,etc."
Simple user interface
Bst interface than ny other shopping app
Great app with great interface. But the deals are not good in this big billion day as last year. Hope for good offers. And keep imroving app like this
D app its performance and User interface are wonderful. But please don't Bluff customers just by the name Big Billion Sale. There are NO attractive discounts at all. Even many items have prices more than your Competitors or approximately an equal price. HOW d HELL can be it a big billion sale !!  And please don't justify by saying ...'its a market place' ...'we r trying to get d best deals' and bla bla. I m not interested coz I m disheartened . Plz Be honest to ur customers !!!
Loved the usage interface. The check out is also fast and easy.
Evrythng is good.. on d interface part... but the prices r hiked on whch discounts r applied.. :-/.. so dis years big billion days r nt good.
"Good interface, speedy transaction.."
Like the web interface but not the products.
"I liked your effort to bring chat like interface on flipcart app, but not everyone use this app all the time, so please make a feature to share with whatsapp or facebook"
Very User-friendly Interface
The user experience is much better on the desktop version.
"Loved shopping via app, nice UI and Interface"
Easy to manage our purchases with initiative interface.. Liked it a lot..
"Applications good if not great. Social chat icon is a pain ,creates a hindrance whilst navigating. Interface colours (light blue) doest look great. The older navy blue looked stunning.cheers."
Not a full interface on Apple I pad
"Simple, minimalist functional design. Makes navigating easy while retaining a clutter free interface. Found what I was looking for and bought it with no hassles whatsoever. Great stuff for shopping on the go. BUT if I'm to share things or recommend them to friends, the share options is limited to your frankly annoying PING option. I do not appreciate you forcing another messenger app down my throat. Revert to the other share options so that I can share products and screenshots with others who can buy them"
I just love the userinterface
Thanks a lot team for taking us to Amazing offers & Variety of products with comfortable user interface through this app.
I love this app. User experience is better than the web app.
Easy to use interface
Well coded.. Good interface... Loved it
"Why sell on app when it doesn't work at all?        Update: Nice to hear that user experience as been enhanced but all we see is UNKNOWN ERROR OR PAGE ERROR IN THE APP.  Tried uninstall & reinstall, still same error...I can't even browse through the product page !!! You know it frustrates to check every hour to only see the same error...    P.S ...I tried this from Nexus 5 on a 60mbps high speed connection, so don't complain on device and network..."
Its very good reg app interface. But I am requesting flipkart team to introduce cashback facility as like paytm.
Best user experience .
Cool interface
Loved this app. User interface is excellent. Please do introduce filter column for WSSeller also so that we can select only the original Flipkart own wearhouse product's.Need ASAP.
Easy interface
Flipkart has worked very well on efficient shopping. Interface is pretty cool. Easy to use functions. Loved it.
Excellent light interface
"Flipkart is best in everything-delievery, app interface,after sales service,products everything is just perfect...."
Really good interface
Simple interface and looks good.easy to search the categories and products and the offers are awsome. Only suggession is the offers in the dashboard should have little personal touch depending upon user's search history and prefrences.
Need to improve its interface.its a lill bit tacky.
I just bought a couple of  things from this app. It have a user friendly interface.I would recommend others to use this app.
"Useless big billion day, no decent offers, stupid interface And the most stupid reply from "" the biggest event organiser"""
"Quite an easy interface to use,love the app"
Superb interface and user experience BT still needs to b improved in page loading
Flipkart always had the most satisfying interfaces of all the online shopping portals. The app is good but the products they sell are costlier than Amazon's.
Nice User Interface and design..
Search interface can be imptoved bought my iphone6s with good discount looking to use..
Runs flawlessly and has great user interface.
Easy to ise interface and user friendly
The app is nice but there is a need of complete shift to a new user experience for e commerce Apps....
User Interface is cool
All goes to simple interface and smooth shopping experience. ...
"Good interface. But goin app only will fire back flipkart. There are people like me who prefers to buy in the big screen..Reconsider ur decision.. Though I like flipkart, if u r not providing it on desktops, I will go for Amazon whch provides me tat comfort.."
Good app. Lots to be done for a easy user interface.
Awful tracking interface
Poor interface
Everything in d app is superbly up to date. Great performance. Great user interface. D best part is GREAT SERVICE. Cancellation and return requests are totally hassle free. Kudos to the team. Great work. Keep it up.
Very difficult to compare items. It can never overtake web interface.
The App is working very fine and interface is very good. Easy to find the things and purchase.
Nice interface
Best shopping app ever ..best user experience ..thank you flipkart
"Fast, robust app with amazing features and awesome user experience."
Expecting better User interface
User interface is 👌
Very good interface
Flipkart's service quality is gr8... But the prices are too high... Use interface is gr8
Interface could be optimized a bit. Feels kind of clunky right now.
"Nice and easy to use
A 10/10 for the interface"
Easy to use.. Loved the interface
Interface is quite easy to navigate.
Good user interface
More intuitive interface would be nice. Sometimes scrolling is to difficult.
Amazing app. Very easy to search with photo. Simple interface
Weird interface.  Not user friendly especially filters
"Why forceably push to install the app even to view a product? I know mobile shopping is the next big thing yadda yadda, but directed to the app while browsing on my LAPTOP?? Poor user experience...Edit: annoying popups every few hours. Uninstalled..."
"Flipkart is one of the greatest online shopping destination in India. Very smooth and easy interface. Offers like big billion days are best of the times in India. I had bought lenovo k3 note for myself, Iball brilliant tab for my younger brother, Swipe Elite for my Cousin and a hairdryer for my wife. All in Offer and maximum discounts. Double thumbs up to Flipkart."
Aweome app. Grt interface. Just love shopping using it.
Neat app probably the best interface in current market
I have used all the popular ecommerce Apps..Flipkart App gives the best user experience.. Good job done
Very user friendly interface
Simple and intuitive user interface.
"I can buy stuff blindly knowing the quality is going to be superior always.App user interface is the best,feels like i am actually shopping at a store.Everyone knows about its service.Keep it up.!"
"It is sickening to see some stuffs r only app. In PC or laptop can see the stuffs in a large screen. PCs have better user experience like opening multiple windows....There must be some hidden agenda or ulterior motive in going app only selling stuff...just to put it simply, it is just sickening"
Navigation and interface is excellent
Best navigation of app. Great user interface. Loved it...
Simple and user-friendly interface
"Good interface, sensitive to notifications, great offers, a lil issue with the delivery options for some items in the particular area but rest is good great work"
Really nice and smooth interface!
Excellent app with modern user interface and strong backend.
Best interface in competitive market.
"This app is simple, clean & has a attractive interface"
I love its interface
Best interface and reasonable
"Very good interface and based on my experience with many shopping apps, flipkart happens to be the best app! I have always loved using this app."
User interface is good
Most things are good except the app user experience and if it is improved with better theme and design it would be a lot great
Star removed.. Checkout screen takes me two times to cart screen and then again even after changing the address and payment option choosing again takes yo check out screen. Finally does not allow to checkout items or proceed for paymet. Also refund status is not shown though order is not confirmed after successful paymet.  Dissatisfied and disappointed in  the user experience. My diwali wishes delayed.... :-(
Best interface
The user experience of flipkart is much better than any other
Great interface...shopping made easy at tips......
"The ping feature is annoying, it's in the way in the middle of the screen. On top of that it keeps coming back even though I keep removing it. I also find some of the notifications spammy. The Amazon app does not give me as many unrelated notifications. Other than these complaints, it's nice interface."
Its interface is good for shopping
"The new version is much better, with a cleaner interface and of course new features, I personally don't like the chat feature and Flipkart's app-only for mobile strategy, I am not able to access Flipkart on my Firefox OS mobile due to that. Anyways, it is a great app, crafted better over time and expecting it to become my better in the future."
The interface is too nice and very easy to use and fast as well
Very intuitive interface
Great user experience...pretty fast app..and quickly adds an item t cart which is very important sometimes when there is a gr8 deal at an amazing price...
Easy n simple interface
But it dont work on low speed net and the interface is not good it just refreshes even by pressing back button.
Interface is pretty neat and simple.. very handy ..
"It has a great user interface.. However when I switch to another application say browser, and come back to Flipkart app the state is not maintained, it shows the first page and I lose my search results. Otherwise, the payment and other interfaces are very user friendly."
"User interface us quite good but some times application gets stuck, otherwise all thing is nice"
"Flipkart makes India proud . easiest interface for shopping ,simply the best .... Jai ho"
This is very simple to use and the interface is very convenient
Please make the interface compatible with rotate function
Good user interface and smooth navigation
The app is not so fast & laggings. The new feature ping makes it more slower.The interface is not so attracting as others.
"To be precise, useful and effective. But there is scope of further improvement to better the user experience and seamless use."
"It is very cool app. I don't like the interface,there return policy, the help provided by them,actually it is run by rogues and rascals.If you call them they didn't provide you assistance you need and rarely they have any solution. Though i like the veriety and products sold by flipkart but they deceived us by delivering wrong products and they didn't take responsibility for that."
Greatly simplified interface...good app
Too much info on interface...not simple.
"Great stuff, best price, good interface to browse products"
Good app user interface
Really i like the interface of app.
Loved the interface
Slow... Crashes many a times... Get the web interface back.
Always enjoy while using this app.well developed app i would like to say.it gives really cool and smooth interface however you use it low data speed.in terms of shopping experiance i loves the way it dose improvement like introducing online chat etc... thanks for the developer
Not very user friendly. Please improve user interface
This app has a good user interface.
So far good. Interface is excellent!!
Great app with easy n detailed interface
good interface
Very good user interface easy to search and find products. Next thing you know is product wont be delivered to your address. No worries you can get it from Amazon
I've been using flipkart app quite often and really likes its simple interface. Great app
Nice interface
Very user friendly app! Nice user interface that understands the the customer
Much appreciated user interface app
Other shopping apps are good but Flipkart is great because it's User Interface is such a easy to use
Better than Amazon and Snapdeal App in interface...keep it up Flipkart!!
"Excellent App! 5 stars! Absolutely pleasure to buy with Flipkart app. Smooth,  good user interface, easy and simple. App works very well.   cheers!"
It nice that flipkart has improved the interface and its much quicker to browse.
User interface is nice but filters are not that good. No COD option in major cities of UP is a big mark down from my side. Lifestyle products are comparatively cheaper but can't say the same for electronics.
"I bought Red me 2 prime...the phone hanged multiple times with no application installed, I called flipkart customer care and they did some test and told it's fine..is some test bigger than user experience and what is the authenticity of that test..really dissatisfied..."
Overall a good app with user interface  is clear. Only business minded selling strategy with flipkart. I was regularly buying from flipkart but now I stopped. When there is a offer sale all the semi urban and  rural areas will go unavailable. Better to buy from Snapdeal n Amazon.
"Lags every time I scroll images/navigate from one item to another, definitely not the interface issue as I run heavy apps too without lags"
"There is a problem with user experience, that is if I navigate within the app and that too n number of levels than landing on homepage is very difficult. I have to tap on back a numerous times to land on homepage."
Nice user interface as well as nice feature
#1 app in the country Very good new look & user interface as well as shopping experience.
This is a good app it has a good interface and in addition to that u get to have additional offers for the app. But still the website view is unbeatable
"From the 1st launch time, definitely improved. But still scope for improvement, especially quick launch, occasional hanging and interface."
Nice user interface
Better than other shopping app.nice user interface. And service is awesome. Thank you flipkart
The interface is pretty impressive
Working smoothly and having flexible and easy user interface. I like it.
Very easy to order and nice interface
"If an e com is moving towards m com with app only operation,they should at least be sure about the user experience they provide. It is absolutely poor,with irritating pop ups and banners. Being said that I appreciate flipkart's other services."
"App helps in selecting many different deals and offers much better than web interface. But the response time isn't as better as the web. Using in wifi itself requires patience, let alone 2G data network."
Flipkart introduced app only deals but when I try to place order in app one or the other issue comes... If I try to place order in web it won't give that deal so I end up placing order in amazon or in paytm even though I have flipkart first subscription. Guys please look more aggressively app errors ... Find some feedback error logging way from user experience and fix issues until stabilising the app allow web discounts also....
Grt interface Grt service
Loved so much for its offers and user interface
Awesome ....with easy and simple interface
Love the interface. It's easy to use :)
Nice Interface
An excellent app. Friendly user interface.
I liked the interface very well. Not purchased. So that in later
Previous version was good even it was a little big in size. That user interface was more good in look and feel
You need to develop the user interface regarding the exchange of gadgets
"Good interface,fun to use"
Intuitive interface and clean design makes this the best e-commerce app in India right now.  WS Retail service is prompt and quick. Great going!
Good interface...but I don't know why you people are charging for shipping for individual products this makes to feel very bad..
"Even though my wi-fi is full strength, the app keeps losing connectivity. Clean interface is a plus. Need product comparision."
Nice and simple interface makes shopping really convenient.
Good interface and easy navigation.  The ping option is also appreciable.
This app has best user interface in all Indian e-com website's
The interface itself deserves 5 stars. Never difficult to find any product and easy to order. The payment process is secure and quick and feels safe. Address entry is hassle free as well. For the functionality of the app the recent update is quite small. Great app.. Keep it up
"Easy to use, neat interface, quick- almost feels like some intuitive cyber assistant!"
Nice and easy interface. Loved it.
I've been using it for a while liked the user interface and fast delivery.... 👍
"I love the user interface. It attracts me more and also puts me in ease while purchasing when compared to other ecom apps. I see some issues always while applying multiple filters, -1 rating for that."
"Taking an initiative of prioritizing a solely app based approach by the likes of Flipkart & Myntra, don't you think this warrants a much stable & user friendlier UI?  Frequent failure to update & lack of hassle free shopping experience fails to deliver the results as promised.  Makes me wonder how practical is this 'app only'  experience summing up on the whole.  Please work out a much more stable app with a attractive interface, 'app only' shopping experience can wait till then."
Nice interface
This app interface easy to search and view the certified buyer rating
Flipkart app is best amongst all online shopping apps.. the interface is nicr and easy to use.. product specifications are mentioned in detail unlike other apps.. however there is scope of improvement in some areas such as.. 1) Require comparison facility 2) Facility to select reviews based on ratings..
Nice interface
Slow interface.
I have been using and buying from flipkart app. Works very good and smooth. Interface is smooth too.
Very good user interface.
Not an User Friendly interface
Good discounts with a user friendly interface and easy to use. Services are also good.
Interface can be changed though it's OK but ain't that user friendly
Nice user interface and wide range of options and secured payment options.
Just love to use the app repeatedly coz of itz interface!!!
"You will not find options to return orders with mobile app, where as the PC / Web version has all these and a easy interface"
Like the interface and ease of browsing through products.
A very good interface and user friendly app!!
Simply Love the interface and ease of use.
Awesome offers.my favourite user interface
"Great app, superb interface."
Friendly user interface....
Fast and friendly...user interface is excellent
Flipkart has best user interface.
The app is very nice it loads very fast got very good deals takes less space compared to other e-commerce apps overall very easy to use the app interface is very well laid out it is very welcoming to the customer.
Hangs a bit..slow at times..nice interface
Amazing update and interface.... Loved it
"Bad experience using the app for purchases. Unlike the web interface which is a breeze, the app is quite faulty. To make matters worse, Flipkart insisting on some transactions only via app, adds to the woes."
App interface is boring and not appealing.
Very fast and good interface
Need Some stuff to buy at very low price :-D  Nice App.... Nice interfaces ping rocks..
"Simple interface, fast loading. Overall good experience till now."
Very good and user-friendly interface. Easily navigate and search products which we want to buy..
Nyc Interface n user friendly...
Really love the app for its light and easy interface. Gives easy access to compare the products and sellers.
Easy  user interface.  I like it.
Fantastic Interface
Simple user interface easy to use and good service
Easy user interface and a perfect showcase of product
"There are many sites.....but i think flipkart blows them rigjt out of the water in terms of interface,customer service and variety of products. Snapdeal comes at a close second.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
"Way better than amazon, snapdeal , eBay, etc.. User interface is awesome!! and include the OPTION TO RATE AND REVIEW products at least in the next update. EDIT: Even after an year am not able to find the option to rate & review. It doesn't make sense when you people promote the usage of a unbaked app! 3* from 5*!"
App is good for purchasing quickly. Wish the interface would be simpler and clean. No complains but just doesn't prefer cramped up space.
Good user interface
User interface is not friendly. I use  Amazon more than Flipkart
I find navigation in app is bit cumbersome. I think it should also improve app interface.
But need to some code change and change some user interface cause all shopping apps interface is same 🏢 need to speed and prettyfy with coding that's all thank you flipkart for loyal e commerce  and support is very good
"1. Browsing is possible but I cannot log off from the app. Why ?? 2. Please do not force users to use ""Ping"" only for sharing. 3. I have been noticing that Flipkart is forcing users to stay on app, make it difficult for log off, if the product is not available, search result will give you other relevant products without notifying user. Such policies will probably gain some customers but definitely for short time. I love to buy products on Flipkart but, such policies makes user experience very frustrating."
"I Love the interface , easy. To browse."
Good interface
great app for shopping.. nice interface.. love the ping feature...
I love the interface. We can find any product easily.
"Smooth user experience, no lags, Overall loved it."
Best Interface
"I am trying to check my orders from 3 days, and the stupid app shows 'internal error, try again later'. Flipkart hires people from iits n still have such a poor app. Really dissapointed. Other apps like amazon, snapdeal are much bettr for user experience!"
"It's feasible, but I'm uninstalling because the mobile website is much much better. Maybe you should make that the app's interface too."
User experience is getting worse.  Frequent loading problems and errors. Frustrating to browse products and filter search results.  Samsung Note 4
Flipkart app is amazing and also has a good interface not only that but offers on app and fast delivery helps make shopping more convenient
"Fake prices. Flipkart is no more trustworthy. Why the hell am I seeing the ads in the middle. I should be able to filter my search, yet I find ads, flipkart has turned out to be completely commercial without thinking about user experience. No use of keeping the app anymore."
Nice user experience
"So far the best e-commerce app for India. With too many categories, these guys have made a well segmented interface. If you see a product on website, you can send a notification to your mobile so that on tapping, it will display that product on app. I found this very useful for sharing & utilising app only offers."
Best user interface
"It's a cool app , great user experience !"
Easy to use amazing interface and happy to use and capare but product is cheaper in market insyide of these sites so be carefull while buying product
Very Good user experience with ease of operation
"i like the user interface. clean, simple and good filtering options. however its ridden with bugs. often i get ""error encountered, please try after sometime"" for no reason. sorting options are sometimes not accurate. can be improved"
User experience is average and can be really improved upon multiple notches.
Good user interface. And nice products.
Best app for shopping online in India. Great user experience and very reliable service
"Improved a lot, good user interface, however  improvement still needed in search options, incurious combos, catalogues, specifications, descriptions."
App User interface and the search mechanism in this app is very good.
Nice interface  and offfer all the time
"Tried putting multiple filter, and after applying what do you get..... Please try after sometime. This App seems to be a replica of IRCTC website, which falls apart very quickly. Had multiple instances of unexpected errors on the App. On the product front, had to return 2 of the last purchses from Flipkart, since the seller had mentioned pack of 2, but shipped only 1 item. Beware Flipkart.... Amazon is giving serious competition, and with this kind of user experience, Flipkart isn't going anywhere."
User friendly interface
Easy to use interface
Filters are not working properly some times.. Once when we are viewing the costs in grid that shows one and after opening another cost.. Is it mean to loot the people or are your web interface is weak?
Worst user experience.. Can't even reach the customer service executive... Hate this..
"Lovely interface, easy to understand, excellent delivery system and communication through email sms and phone....Thanks Flipcart"
User Experience is good very smooth
"I buy all most items from online shopping from all the sites but your user interface is the most attractive thing which I like most, your customer care is perfectly supportive I wanted to give 5 BUT some time your dealer isn't delivering items on my  pin code I use 6 officials address and it's happening mostly when products are very less price or you started the sale. So please make the solution. If we  want to buy and you aren't delivering  it, it's felt so 😞."
Nice user interface
"Hey flipkart team, I hope you are listening. After the latest update this app has become very slow. It takes time to load even on a wifi with broadband connection. If this is it's loading time on wifi then what can I expect on the greedy mobile operators network. Please fix this issue. One more advice please give less importance to your user interface and more importance to service and optimization. Sincerely a regular user."
Its the media and the interface that keeps me interested into it.... And purchased products should also be verified from seller...... Felt cheated twice.
"Fast, responsive.. Good interface..    Love it"
Good user experience in shopping...with this app...keep up flipkart....
Easy and simple user interface
User interface has been upgraded as per the mobile needs and e-commerce features
Amazing wow loved it best deals very cheap and the best of the interface. I bought a new Redmi 2 prime very good service
Nice user interface....
"App is awesome, nice user experience through out the application. Good lock."
Amazing interface... cool products
"App is having a nice user interface compared to amzon and eBay. eBay and amzon is having a wide area product delivery using postal services,bluedart and other courier services. Try  to deliver products to those places where amzon and eBay is making delivery."
Smooth app with better userinterface
Please Change the interface like MYNTRA
Well it's good. Not that good. It's kinda buggy and lags and sometimes it looks like a web wrapper. Maybe just update the interface a bit more? Thanks.
Good deals.. Friendly interface
When it comes to user experience it's not give good experience ..
"This app is just useless, filters section is just for enhancing the interface. They don't work even. Every brand expands but Flipkart is opposite. Earlier it used to deliver most of the products in my city, but now 9 out of 10 products are not delivered here. When it asks for enter your pincode so that results can be filtered for your city and when I do so even then it shows me all the products without filtering. The app sometimes loses connection even there is 3g/4g connection."
Good User Interface
"Slow  While all the other heavy apps run smoothly on 3G/WiFi network, Flipkart app refuses to show the product catalogue. The interface is sluggish. Even the notifications start to appear only after the app is visited once."
"App has nice user interface, smooth.one thing that could notice that they finally enabled the future to share product via any sharing app rather than ping.Flipkart tried very hard to make ping popular but failed."
"Its good but can be better! Its not as smooth as Snapdeal is. Interface (layout) of app is bit boring and older. Anyway, we love shopping on flipkart only."
what's wrong with you guys. with every update only the app size increases. what about the quality of info displayed. the product display shows a wrong selection of items. You guys have really gone way under in your user experience.
Nice interface and good shopping experience with Flipkart.
Interface is slow. Takes a lot of time to load. Filter works horribly. Please work with your 'Filter' guys. It malfunctions a lot.
"Your app is the best. It has a very user friendly interface and a wide range of products is available. Also you deliver products on time, and they are always genuine.   Keep up the good work."
"So much greed, degrading user experience, amazon is much better at least they care about customers                                                                                                                      edit : I am unable to retrieve my account with the ""simple"" two step process because i have another account on flipkart with the same email id as on facebook ( like most people ) so it conflicts and raises an error."
Nice User Interface
Its interface is better than other online shopping apps...
Its very easy to use...i use a few other shopping apps...but this is the most user friendly...i love the interface.
Good app  good interfaces easy to shopping.
Great user experience
"Best online shopping experience, great interface..."
The interface is pretty much good easy to access n I like the feature of related items shown below the product the only thing that disappointed me is the scalability of the product as 20-25% of the product are not available to my pin .... I hope u will look into this matter.
The interface is too good than other shopping apps
Super friendly interface
Interface is good. And quality is great. Thanks for gaining our trust.
nice interface
superior user interface
Nice app.cool n easy to use user interface but add option for switching background to dark grey or black
Totally loved the new flipkart app's design and interface. So smooth.. Keep it up
"Flipkart new interface is just awesome, I love Flipkart,  always best and ahead and best of luck Flipkart team"
Easy user interface and helpful
The new interface is much better effort from the coders. Still lacks shortcut to home & other useful links while on browse mode. Keep a master link on screen top at all times for quick selections.
My all time favourite shopping app... I liked the new user interface... you guys are awesome... keep up the good work up...
"flipkart is one of the best among e-retail sites. you just think and type at flipkart and there you have it on flipkart. but this app is one among the worst app of e-retail sites, the app hangs a lot and i feel is making huge losses for the company. i request flipkart developers to kindly improve there app interface because the updates provided by you are not helping."
Nice interface
Very nice user interface
Gud user interface loved the updated app
Super intuitive and amazing interface... keep up the good work Flipkart!
Nice user interface
User interface is very friendly and works like awesome
Much bttr interface but no option for size in filters. Must fix that bug
User experience is awesome and UI is best.. You can easily search and Buy. Service is also nice.
Good app but still needs more improvements but still it way better than Amazon in user interface
"Best  for offers especially in case of electronic and fashion, easy to return, fast delivery  and app has very good interface too. So prefer it instead of Amazon or else any.. . only one bad thing is that it apply extra delivery charge on many products .."
User interface improve ment
New interface. I loved it.
Nice and improved interface
Interface loading for slower connections a lot... remaining everything good....
It is a very good app with easy interface
Nice interface
"The app is simply superb and very easy it use and order. User interface is very good too. The filters could be better,  and tracking info can also be improved.  Hope  to see that in the next update"
After updating very nice app experience in user interface
The interface of the app with us is great. The search might become even more user friendly.
Improved User Interface 👌
"Looking good, user interface is so good when compared with other applications."
This new interface is great. Check out options are really easy. Searching products have also been improved. Images are big and clear. Overall love this app.
Awsome app like the interface
User friendly ! Good interface.
The app interface is very crappy.further it crashes many times and  while browsing messagesof cannot load the page happens comes very often
"This new user interface is really awesome, easy to find things and really runs faster than all older versions. Its very sober and classic in looks. You can find all the features, reviews and description on one place."
The user interface is very good !
Easy interface everything on a click
Interface is great and comfortable
User interface is easy to use.
User interface is just an awesome! Loving it
Nice app  nice interface
Love the interface and has very good offers
"I liked the app interface earlier. Now the interface is too damn slow. It takes a lot of time to refresh a single page, even though I have a 2 GB RAM. I am not liking it now."
New app is better with easy interface.
A very user friendly app. User Interface is very good!
Simple and efficient user interface
"The interface is very laggy, instead of adding unnecessary features try fixing your UI. You guys can look up in myntra/jabong's app if needed. That's the way an app should work....myntra jabong's app are very smooth with minimal lag, flipkart's is the most laggy app amongst the shopping apps I have used. Should increase the apps performance and a smooth UI like jabong/myntra."
"Why am I not able to see my orders in the app! Do you really want me turn on my PC and check it on the website coz let me tell you that whole process, it's really not that thrilling. Sense the tone fk. Seriously, Amazon's app interface might be boring as hell but that stuff works."
Better interface and easy to shop ...
The new update is good and stylish. Very nice interface.
"Love the interface , easy to use and very convenient."
Likevd interface ..
"Flipkart shopping experience has been great so far and app has been having best interface but since you have added sponsored product ads inbetween the listed products, you have spoiled the fun of app. Come on you people are not running olx like free service, you are already earning enough from selling products, don't spoil your app by ads."
New interface is really good.
Awesome interface   user friendly....!
"Great interface , & easy to find all items."
This update bring the User Interface on fire.....loved this app.......no doubt..it is better than any other shopping app in India
nyyc user interface better searching options

good interface.
Nice user interface compared with other online shopping apps..
Easy interface love to shop... Easy to use and a variety of wide range of products... Love it....:p
Previously its user interface worked even with 2g.... But after update its not even working with wifi..
If I would have. The option of negative stars I would have given to it...worst update and app interface.disgusting
Good user interface... searching for easy way...Nice one
Very well sorted and an amazing interface......
Awesome user interface .....highly recommended.

Easy user interface.. Make me to feel of having comfortable and satisfied shopping experience..  Good luck flipkart.. U changed the India's shopping views..
Hassle free returns  and great discounts  with easy app interface
It's such a leading e-commerce company... U must be hiring great engineers... Then what about the UI...  The interface is really slow.. The picture loading time is a lot more than expected... Pls take care of it
"This app user interface is more user friendly and reliable. It creates a confidence in customer to order something. Its nice, go for it...!"
"Absolutely spotless interface!!!! Loving it totally!!! Way to go, guys!!!"
Excellent app friendly user interface and very useful.
Very awesome interface and easy access to orders.No bugs at all.

Nice interface...all in all...a cute app...vry much useful
Good and simple  interface
"I just love the Flipkart app. It has an easy to use, very intuitive and a rich user experience. Finding the products is pretty easy too."
"Amazing app amazing products. But like everything in life, there is a room for improvement in terms of user interface and rationalization of delivery charges. When I buy more than one products from flipkart (sellers may be 4-5) worth thousands of rupees why should i pay delivery charges on each product individually..."
Although I loved new user interface but this has made the app work slowly I am trying to order two products since 3 days and I am not able to place the order. I was trying with 4 G connection. Team please fix this issue because I don't want to buy this from any other e tailer.
New interface looks good
I've using this aap...didnt find any issue ..easy refund.great user interface
Good interface.....
Better interface
Easy to use. Best interface...
Smart Guys at fk.. IT has one golden rule. Don't try and fix it if it is not broken. I used to love the filtering that u guys used to have. So many problems now.. 1. The result set just changes to something random on its own. 2. The numbers don't add up. 3. Previous ui was much better. 4. Don't design ui for small interfaces. I wonder if they even shop with you guys. 5. Give me an ability to comment and rate my purchases.6. can't buy flipkart advantage from the app. 7. More if you contact me..
The interface is better. No issues so far. Good that the chat option from the previous version is removed as it was not a great value add
Amazing User interface :)
"Every time it notifies, and they provide notification through not just app but mail and sms..also their user interface of app is far more better than amazon...thank you flipy.."
I'm really happy & satisfied with your     services. But it would be better if you could solve the interface problem in your app.
Not upgrade interface it took much time to load
Great User experience
As above said while sorting the result it shows problem and also new interface is boring
The new user interface is butter smooth. Gone are the navigation errors found in the previous versions. UPDATE: Filters don't work. I click one item and something else opens. Search is very slow and non responsive. Please make Android app just as better as iOS one.
"Loved the interfaces, you get the same feeling of searching on web."
Amazing buying experience at Flipkart app.. nice User Interface
Great interface... But takes time in loading... Try to keep a basic type
Can you add compare option in user interface. also I request to Flipkart for launch Flipkart affiliate app for Flipkart affiliate partners.
User friendly interface...
Superb interface
New user interface is awesome
Flipkart app provides with the best interface I've seen among the other toplisted shopping apps.
Lovely interface
"Easy to use, good interface!"
Good user experience and Flipkart is improving day by day.
Most trusting app. & very good interface
User interface are good and fast response.
user interface is not good
Bad app. Filters don't work. Click on filter and it says something went wrong. Really bad user experience. Disappointed 😞
The interface used in this is better than any other online shopping site app
I like the flipkart over other shopping apps it's cool interface and good speed are the liked factors
Not a very pleasing interface.
"Good user interface, huge variety of products"
"Rating is just for user interface but app operations sucks start from login. When you guys don't wana provide social media as login option, why the hell that option exists in login page?? Are you guys capturing database through our Gmail & FB a/c??"
"This is good as I said gud interface, the views of product,and also selection of product is gud"
Good User interface overall user friendly
"I always purchase from flippant,  but I'm sorry to say that your app is s#it. Just spent half an hour just trying to get the app to filter results properly.. It was so smooth before now it looks like a cheap interface full of weird bugs in filter & sorting. I'll stick to the desktop version."
"Great product quality, fast delivery, and better Interface. Last but not the least..."" All original products""!!!"
User interface of Flipkart is much better than Amazon.. I had bought a laptop charger from Amazon which last only for 2 months.. I had recently bought le eco le2 from Flipkart..their delivery as well as the package was in good shape..mobile is also working well...
Good user interface
Good app. Chat interface is nice.
I didnt like the new user interface with new update... The seller details and delivery charge all that have to be found out on screen small font size is not good before it was catchy with bright colors
This app is much slower. Improve the accessing speed. User interface is right
"Superb interface, limitless products & great customer service."
Nice App.. User friendly Interface
Interface of this version is too good than previous versions. Just keep the good work goin on ..
"After update, app just get slower. Very bad user experience. Had to switch to website to make a purchase."
Friendly interface and quick response
best interface u can get . But flipkart !!!!wht hppnd!!!! why all brands and flash sales are turning towards amazon though u r better.. jus bcz of shifting of tht brnds u r lagging behing amazon
Nicee... Really like the interface...
Simple and nice interface. Easy to Order.
User Experience
Good delivery and good interface makes it excellent shopping app..
Its really nice.Its interface is very  beautiful
User interface is good.
easy interface ..  hands on experience. Very effective..
"The shopping on flipkart is cool and I haven't faced any problem till yet. However, I am facing a problem regarding app interface which I am reporting from over a year i.e. the app is showing that I have 1 unread notification even after clearing all. This is quite frustrating for me. Please take a check."
"Great app, smooth interface... No hassles at all. I love Flipkart"
Good user interface
Interface is superb. But as per the cost of the products .it's bit more costly than other online portal
New user interface is amazing.. might have 1-2 bugs but it's okay.. appreciate it.. 😍😘
"Like the new interface, just change the color theme. Also needs to focus a lot on customer service, Amazon is so far winning the race with low prices and impeccable service. It is sad to see homegrown product loosing out."
"The very first thing which everyone encounters when he/she is on Flipkart is that it responds very slowly than compared to Amazon app, i personally think that the Amazon app is faster to search because its interface is clean and not cumbersome."
Love The Interface
Bad interface
"Its Little bit unsatisfiable with new one, not as  good interface. Minor icon to selection. I like older flipkart as new version"
"What I love about in this app or website is which it clearly gives the idea about the product! The flipkart left the deciding authority to be the user through lovely and 'truly what needed' user interface! Flipkart stands high in features like product comparisons, user reviews and ratings, pictures, detailed specifications, flipkart advantage on products! Other apps or sites fails to excel in it, which is what important and needed by buyer!"
Plenty of scope for improvement in interface and suggestions
"When user is in grid view, list view or side profile view image (allowing next available view) should be displayed but not the grid view image.  Please check and correct for better user experience"
"Delayed view. Comparing with other shopping app like Amazon, snapdeal,myntra,ebay,shopclues flipkart is the worst app. Not good interface and and also not good speed"
"I am using flipkart for last 5 years and it was a great experience using it. Interface is user friendly,latest products and easy checkouts...thank u flipkart for your great service"
Great user Interface
App Interface is nice.
Love its user interface
The interface is user friendly and I've made orders via app earlier.. The experience is satisfactory.
Awesome!!!! Interface is too good.
"As a shopping app..it has the best interface. I don't know why people r saying shall buy it out, they don't worth. Dere app is a crap"
This application might have goo dinterface but the products that we shop are duplicate and copied. It's misleading and irritating to wait for your product and receive a price of crap. #myopininon
The App interface is kinda cool but it has got lots of bugs and sometimes it won't show any search results at all even when my Internet speed is high.
Nice really easy to use interface.
It's the best app among online shopping apps.Best user interface!!
Love 2 use this app ....good user interface

Migrated from windows phone to Android for sheer user experience of these apps... Superb
But the user interface can be made easier and smarter
Best user interface. Better than most other shopping apps
User-friendly and well designed user interface
It's interface is very good but speed is noticeable slow
"Sometimes the prices are little high, but the user interface of this app is very good."
During the viewing the product when we scroll top to bottom ping comes within 10 seconds again and again whether you closed it or not so it iritates very much .plz disable it this is a bad user experience
Fast and lag free interface
User freindly... Brilliant interface... Reliable... Nd much more
Excellent app. User friendly interface. Loving it
Flipkart is the one which I can trust completely....I bought my phone...which I am using...and it just works fine...best service...and the support was very good...they kept me informing about my product's status...about the app...it is lag free..unlike other shopping apps...which show some lags.....but I gave it 4 star because I feel like the user interface should be changed..it's too old now...I would recommend to try new theme..just that's it...other things are lovely
Nice interface
Excellent user interface!!

Though many shopping apps have come up but the speed & accuracy with which the flipkart app opens up & displays products is unmatched. Some issues  like applying filters are there but flipkart has evolved over the years with a new & user friendly interface.  Keep it up

Very responsive User Interface
Awesome user experience
"The best thing i like about flipkart is its ease of access and user interface which makes browsing, comparing and buying of products a fun like experience...."
The offers right now are simply disappointing compared to amazon..and the 'aided search' and filters are simply annoying now. Doesn't filter or sort properly. Too much headache to even use let alone purchase. Myntra has much much better app interface. Why can't you simply translate the same here when you own it. Edit: I am fine with the offers. Been purchasing since years because of the trust. I am mainly disappointed with the search. It doesn't sort or filter according to my selections at all
The app interface is good .App is attractive much than other shoping app
Very nice app and easy to use interface
User interface is so much better than any other site
"Features, user experience is good. App is fast."

"Loved your new interface style and with the sophistication of your app, this seems to be the best shopping app in the store"
Very good app with glitch free experience. Smooth interface. I would have given 4.5 if possible. Only thing which I don't like is size this app takes. Being an engineer I know we can still work on it to make it more lighter not much on interface side but definitely on storage space it requires. But nothing sort of worst.
Good interface for payment options
Please improve the app interface and the lag it's too small to search thru the products would appreciate if you can categorise it like a booklet.
Nice user interface
Impressive user experience
Love the new interface of the App
Liked the interface and service

"The Ekart delivery service now provides option to customers for scheduling a delivery day. Wonderful it is. I could schedule my delivery according to my conveyance, even before the item was out for delivery.  Kudos Flipkart! It'll be great if you can provide an interface which can let us choose a delivery time as well."

"User experience is very nice and easy to choose desired product, I'm not very sure about the discounts and offers. Over all its good app for busy peoples."
Well designed user interface
Interface is really good. You get what you want. Search engine is precise. Good experience. Still going to give it a 4 star rating so that you people strive to make the Flipkart experience still more better.
User friendly interface... Lot of payment options... Should add the filter to select Seller... Then it will definitely deserve 5 stars...
Great app for browsing through the product categories. Clean interface. Easy to check out. But still no comparison to the web browser.
This is a wonderful app with very apt navigation. However I feel the web interface is as important as the Android counterpart and you can't put one over other. So its good you are giving as much importance to both.

Wow interface best offers good options
From the title I think it's quite evident that I'll say the app's pretty good! The experience is very good with the card like interface! The side panel gives you quick access to every information you'll need! Now about the cons! The app is a bit laggy on start up! Though that will differ from phone to phone and carrier to carrier!

"Wide range of products, easy access, user friendly interface and affordable as well. Chommon!"
App is good .. Flipkart service is also good only reason for not giving star is user interface can still be improved..

Easy user interface
Best user interface among the trending shopping apps. It's really a large storage online shopping mall.
I have come across situations when I required items which are not locally available. At those juncture I have always bestowed trust on flipkart and it hasn't disappointed me as yet. Other e-commerce sites also offer cod on their interfaces but when you try to finally place order you realize that they were simply misleading you but it is not so with flipkart. All in all i am a happy customer .
Easy to use and smooth user interface. Thanks flipkart...
Although I have had a terrific user experience with flipkart I am aghast to learn that it is against net neutrality.
Everything is great in and from Flipkart. User Interface of this app is just excellent.
"User interface VB is awesome,list of item appear very quickly and payment options is also sufficient"

Worst interface.   Also can't confirm order many times
Like the user interface.
"Smooth interface, good service"
Nice Interface
"Good but far behind Amazon. User experience is at low standard. Item images are from same angle, seems like trying to hide information. Put something in kart in night and in morning they will increase price, without notifying you. You cannot give feedback easily, surprisingly, I tried for 30 min to find a place to help them by giving feedback, I did not find so came here."
Very beautifully designed user interface and quality of good
"I love the interface and how easy the app is to use. However, what I have a minor problem with is that fact that when one buys cosmetics, manufacturing and expiration dates are not mentioned. Subsequently, if one buys a product and after delivery finds out that it's going to expire in a couple of months, then it's a shame."
"App is very heavy, user interface not that nice."
Love the app and its interface
Very good interface 2 shop.great offers.best products.I always search it like using Facebook.
Tons of features in app. Very user friendly interface. Just loving the UI while shopping😊

Since the inception I have been shopping from flipkart when it used to sell online Books..... Really liked its services ..Products very authentic.. Sometimes price goes off to the roof..though it keeps me satisfied with product authenticity. Replacements issues I seldom face but are handle efficiently by customer support team...2. Is that Flipkart application is wicked cool rich with contents very well planned to flex items quality n specifications..USER INTERFACE IS AWSOME. Keep up..

"It's an easy way to buy products here it's more comfortable than any other e-commercial app ,although I have buyed only two products but it has really faster shipping than it's estimated.....The only thing Lacks this app is it should have a more comfortable UI (User Interface) in it."
Nice app. Easy interface
"The user interface is good. But, the system slows down often and we miss out on several offers that we want. I use Flipkart mainly to purchase books and till date, I have never been disappointed by the quality of bookd that I have purchased from the assured sellers. The discounts available are pretty good too."
User-friendly interface
Wah! Flipkart best online store to explore value based products to the customers at affordable prices..Nice user interface... Feeling proud on time delivery...Thanks to Flipkart
"3 years before I gave this app a 1 star rating. It was buggy, slow and the interface was just not upto the mark. Down the line they have improved upon a lot of things. OT has now been almost 6 years since I started shopping at Flipkart and I must say I am impressed by their work until now. The current app has all the goodies that an online marketplace can provide. The number of products have increased, the delivery times have got much better and overall my confidence of shopping with them has increased. Hopefully they should be able to carry forward the momentum. The one star I have reduced because of stupid flash sales. You are never able to get your hands on anything during that time."
Extremely user friendly and great interface... Varied options...fair price... Genuine products...... 100% recommended
"Nice app with good interface, love this app and also good offers on products 😇"
Best User experience

I have tried to contact customer service center but they did not respond properly. In fact, they told me that they can't do anything. The price they are showing is in User Interface is lesser than actual price at the time of placing final order. Worst experience!"

Its good interface
"Flipkart is the best ecommerce app in india. I am saying this because I think I am the most eligible person to write reviews. I only shop online, and that too at least once every week. I have tried almost all shopping apps/sites say amazon, snapdeal, shopclues, abof, yepme, yebhi and manymore but no one has been able to provide such commitment. Amazon does provide good service and delivery but their app sucks. They have really bad interface, search and filter options. Flipkart outdoes amazon in overall comparison."
Interface in not so intuitive. Beside this there is some bug while entering card no.
Prices are more than amazon And also image loading and interface is so poor

best user interface out there.
"It is the best Indian online shopping site till date. Except very few things like emi options available and some missing items, everything is crowd puller including user interface support, delivery time, shopping cart management, payment options and support and return request. Upon cancellation of some item money refund is very fast even after shipping of that item. Most importantly the online shopping portal showcases largest number of dealers having lakhs of varieties of quality products which you can't find within offline shopping mall anywhere in the world."
Nice Interface and great variety of products.
"Best n trusted shopping site , App User interface is awesome 👌👌👌 But please improve n add new filters"
Absolutely pathetic customer complaints interface. Complements their customer executives apathy to the customer plights brilliantly.

Awesome interface
Quick and easy shopping . Smart and intuitive interface .
Better user interface than amazon
The app is really good and the user interface is excellent when comparing with other shopping apps......The reviews are really confusing coz half of people give good review about a product but other half give really bad review..... So cannot relay on the reviews to buy a product.. Shopping experience is really good.....
The app is excellent! The shopping experience from the app was comparatively much better than the Amazon India Shopping app. The user experience is really enjoyable. Though the app can be improved by making the availability of products on a wider landscape and areas and the introduction of refurbished products!
App is good and interface is pretty easy
Good and clean interface and above all the return policy is very very very  good
Great app.. and simple user interface

"I have been a part of Flipkart family for a long time now. There are so many e-commerce sites but I can say Flipkart is the best. Of all the products I have ordered from Flipkart, hardly I have found any compromise in the quality. And if I found any, then the replacement facility is awesome without any jibber-jabber. Talking about the mobile user interface experience , it has the best one.   So, all in all, kudos to Flipkart team. Keep doing the great work and I would love to be a part of your family throughout."
Flipkart is a good e-commerce website and provided good quality product and easy interface to using it...

"If your internet speed is slow then it will annoy you a lot. Snapdeal has much faster user interface than this. But if you want an honest information about products then this is the best place.  Edited Review on 18-07-2017.. Internet speed and user interface issue is sorted out very well now with 4G era. Welcome Step of addition of videos of products.  Hope Other shopping apps like Myntra, Paytm Mall, Ajio, Fynd etc who don't even have space (in their intentions) for CUSTOMERS REVIEWS of PRODUCTS will learn from you."

"Good app for online shopping. Number of products available is high. It has a  good user interface and they provide good customer. Nevertheless, I doubt about the genuineness of the original prices and when they show the offer prices. The buyer has to be careful about the brand and quality and see the reviews of the product.     service"

"Amazon has a more fluid interface, and has few exclusives.... But I dont like gheir policy of lightening deals since it pushes people too much. Onegets pushed to select products which add up to 5000 or more during cash back deals. Flipkart does.not do that which I appreciate."

Nice app..Interface works great in phone..Just need to stick to the price in sale that they shows before sale.

I had received my orders just on the same day and very next day.

User interface is easy to use and thanks for great sales like big billion day.
"But for some bugs which don't filter and sort products despite setting parameters, the app is smooth, fast and has a good interface. The presentation of categories has changed, making it pictorial and as per pre-set specific categories of flipkart e.g. brand/price/style etc. And I personally preferred the traditional categories."
Really easy user interface. Better than Amazon shopping application.Hope to have more offers in future.
Nice interface

A lot better than amazon or any other e commerce website/app .... better user interface... better design.... better packaging... better replacement/return policy.... one thing in which amazon overtake flipkart is that amazon is available in various other countries also... hence more multi national companies have ties with amazon than flipkart.... rest flipkart is the best....

Gud app for online shopping. User friendly interface
"Awesome experience shopping, loved the user interface."
Awesome user experience
Good app..nice interface... moderate prices...love the books especially in Flipkart
The overall user interface is good enough but what it lacks the most is a well functioning flash sale system. One of the worst I've seen so far. Flipkart needs to up its ante or keep losing its customers. Not a tough choice but time will tell.
Nice user interface
Good User Interface and nice deals
good interface
The best thing that I love about flipkart is it's app interface which creates mood for shopping
Simple n easy user interface.nice application.

Best online shopping site in India. App user experience is far better than Amazon. in
Great user experience with great prices for online shopping. Filters are very good compared to other shopping apps.
Delivery is best and user interface is better than competitors
Better interface on web and user friendly...but it would be best if the options are also available in terms of product and offer which I see it's lacking behind in recent time
A great app. Handy to use. User friendly interface.
Flipkart has been at it's best when it comes to user experience. It is way much better than it's competitors. Keep it up Flipkart and introduce newer business models to start making profits in the coming years. Cheers!
Loved it....User friendly interface ...And very good customer care experience
User friendly interface
User friendly interface.. Better than Amazon..
Easy interface &  Superb shopping experience with Flipkart
Great app amazing interface. it is even easy to use for old and fancy for new. Flipkart has always been on top in  e-commerce and best service by sellers too. I never got dissapointed by flipkart till now Love it
Taking time to review this app because of the new pay later option added by flipkart. A bold and  thoughtful move that will make sure there is no last minute cancellations done like in cash on delivery. Though this facility is  limited to few sellers i find it really useful because I get to experience the product use it before  i actually pay for it. Hoping to see more sellers adding this facility for better user experience.
Wonderful experience. Innovative interface. Simply loving it.
Good interface and well done online merchandising..makes browsing easy and shopping experience fabulous
"Smooth searching, sorting, filtering and order placement interface, good experience! Some filter options could be made better, and option to sort by ratings is missing."
Great interface. Fast access.
User interface is better den Amazon
Fooling people on the name of flash sale . Stupid interface for flash sale product . Will never buy a XIAOMI product and uninstalling the app . Good bye
It's a very good app with everything available at just a click. The interface is nice. The product range is just as big as a dinosaur.
The goods thing first - App user interface is top notch compared to other players in the market. The ease of finding products are pretty good. Now the bad thing - Flipkart will need to catch up to amazon for pricing. 70-80% products that i search for are better priced on amazon.
"This is an experience for me with this app, very good interface i like so much and good performance i like it."
Over the years Flipkart has emerged as one of the best shopping sites.It is popular for its swift and  authentic product deliveries.The Return and Refund policies too are customer friendly and quite hassle free.Shopping through this app  is always a fun.But the user interface should improve from time to time.Otherwise great...
"Flipkart has provided good interface for purchasing high quality products on very efficient price, thumbs up for Flipkart"
Good user experience
Simply better than best even better UI than the others. More reach and enhanced user experience. Keep it up.
Easy interface and nice products
"Flipkart has a very clean user interface, everything is organized very properly not like Amazon... love you Flipkart 😘😉"

Nice platform easy interface could be used by anyone
Very good interface...
"Its a perfect place to shop for one who doesn't want to go outside. Yeah it has a very nice and ordered interface, and never gets you bored while scrolling it!"
Nice app. Good user experience. Good front end design. Nice performance. What can be improved is the flipkart deals. What flipkart does is increase the price of items before sale and then during sale offer them for the exact price they were before their price was hiked  in the first place.
I like the app's interface.
"Well, I am a long time user of flipkart and really it is a good service. The interface of this app is much user friendly. However I have encountered bugs while using filters. And please, I want to update my mobile number. So please add an option to change it. Otherwise products are great and services are much good."
Very good and user friendly interface.
User interface is nice... Over all good experience
"Very useful and simple user interface,good service"

"Good app, nice interface and user experience."
Nice User experience and service.
"Amazon is way better than Flipkart. Shame on Flipkart, it was amateur while its first flash sale of mi 3 and its even today . While using Amazon I use to get 15 min to buy a product once it was added to the cart, I don't no when Flipkart will solve this problem. Today it was third time I tried purchasing mi phone but as always it's was in cart and the very next second while commencing the payment ,mobile was out of stock. Flipkart needs to solve this mess,  even mi store  has option of placing order first and then gives an hour for payment. Please use your investments in building good structural and robust interface."
The User Experience is really Good And on time delivery with great Products
"All time AWESOME APP, USER INTERFACE IS VERY EASY,"
Interface is Good than Earlier Easy to get all deals and offers. Even booking also easy
User interface of this app is better than anyone else.
Awesome interface..

Good interface
Good interface compared to amazon
easy interfaces
Awesome interface!!!   The best part is how quick they respond on your conserned problem !!!   Really amazing .
Having a variety of stuff and good user interface...Flipkart's brilliant
"Nice E-commerce website with multi variety of products. The display, interface, speed, products' details are quite nice."
When are you going to improve your interface. Worst experience
"The app has developed quite nicely.  Experience is smooth and great.  1. But, while ordering products like mobile phone with extended warranty and buy back, app and online interface does not allow the no cost EMI to be availed! The system should be able to process this single check out internally as separate transactions one with no cost EMI and one without. This is important since warranty and buy back cannot be bought separately!  2. Users cannot add photos on product reviews, which should be enabled. Real Photos and videos make decision making much easier, like on Amazon."
Nice interface
better user interface than amazon..
"When I started to use Flipkart, the service was not very good but gradually, i have been very happy with the service that they have been providing. Mobile app interface is very good and easy to use"
"Good web interface, good products, good service"
The App is very slow and doesn't opens search results.kills the user experience
nice and easy user interface
"till now most reliable and trendy app, keep on doing the modification and one more thing jusk liked your updated web interface, all the best for future."
Good user interface

Nice interface
Great design. Amazing user interface and best reviews.
Keep it up And i like ur User interface
I love it's user interface
interface is best  in all indian online apps.
"Its too heavy for 2g users in India. Takes a lot of time to open. It takes ages to search any product. When it finally opens, the specifications are missing. The customer would like to see the specifications first, but this app loads it the last. The refresh interface is also very cumbersome. Even the said filters in the app are not that great when you actually want to filter out something. Very limited options. As an app browser it sucks and has way too many bugs."
Interface is much better than other shopping apps
Much more authentic products and a lot more emphasis on user experience than other online shopping apps
Interface is average type as compared to myntra
Nice app interface. Trustworthy name. Excellent service.
Earlier Flipkart's prices were higher than amazon. But now they are comparable and even lesser on some products. The app interface is also good.
The interface could be more better
The interface is continuously evolving. Very convenient and super fast delivery.
The best user experience when it comes to online shopping

"Superb interface, product very good."
"It is a good app. Nice interface and is trustable, but I can't go ahead the continue option from my wish list. Moreover I don't get why is it not letting me use the forgot password option. It says try again but nothing happens even though I try again. Please fix it."
Nice userinterface
Best user experience And Best offers
In flipkart or web interface application we can't able to place a call back request frm flipkart customer. It say Request failed try again later. Worst App management.

User interface is very pleasant & user friendly. Loved it.
The app is brilliant. It has been on every phone that I have ever owned. I like the app interface and the offers too. I have been trying to purchase the redmi note 5 pro. Hope flipkart checks this review and gives it to me.
very user friendly interface..perfect app..never had any issues with it..love Flipkart
Nice. User interface is fab
Great user experience
Easy user interface.... Make more easy shopping experience 😊
"Flipkart has literally changed our shopping experience. I cannot remember when was the last time I had to visit a brick-and-mortar store to buy a t-shirt or a pair of jeans. Having said that, Flipkart has come a long way and kept improving the Flipkart app quite often for a more friendly user experience. However  I would like to suggest that the Filters should be more refined in the apparels section. The item attributes should be more defined so that user can select the appropriate Filters and not go over the endless items. Something more in line to what your sister company MYNTRA offers."
"I always have a great time with flipkart , its user interface is awesome and simple .  The product always reach me before time ."
I missed using this app so much... Now its back with new and improved interface with so much of new products and options. Keep it up!!! It's awesome!!
"Best online shopping site. Wen compare with other shopping site, flipkart is best in service, delivery, site interface, apps, cost, etc. Then i like modebof payment. Easy to buy.."

Useful app good user interface
One of the best user interface
"Improved and Updated App provides more flexibility and good choices for 
Shopping great User Interface .Good Job Team ."
"Hopeless user experience while buying mi phone. Every page starting from 
add to cart till payment page, I gives error indicating high volume. If you 
are allowing till payment page, you should reserve the inventory till 
payment confirmation and allow the user to complete the transaction. If you 
can't handle that volume in flashbsales, you better nogotiate with vendor 
to have enough inventory. This has happened third time in a row while 
buying a mi phone. Flipkart needs to understand that its ratings is getting 
affected because of vendor's fake demand creation strategy which is Redmi 
in this case."
"Flipkart... When you add a product to your cart how is it that it shows 
that product unavailable during checkout !!? Why isn't there a timer to 
checkout like every other site while buying.... U guys are cutting corners 
at wrong places .... Poor customer service poor user experience can't even 
copy Amazon properly , natural selection is coming for you !!"
"Very nice user interface for searching the product and any body can handle 
easily."
Very user friendly interface love it!

Super app and it gives us a good user interface loved it
"My favourite shopping app .Am a daily customer of this app . Fast delivery 
and good service are the main attraction and the cash on delivery option 
also make flipkart as my favourite. Product description ,photos and videos 
make you choose wisely. User interface of the app is very nice . One 
problem is there ,when we search a product say mobile we get a list I 
scroll the list and open a phones page . When we close the page it will 
start from beginning . It is one of the annoying thing I have noticed in 
this app. I expect they will fix this problem in their next updation.Except 
I like it and enjoy shopping with flipkart ."

"There's no reason to rate Flipkart any less than 5*. However, I request 
Flipkart app development team to make the app light weighted and fast. I've 
found Flipkart as the second slowest app in my phone (Facebook being the 
first!). Item description doesn't load faster. It takes almost 50-60 
seconds to load a full page. Yet, I'm not willing to rate Flipkart any less 
than 5*, as I'm very satisfied with the Item Description, User Friendly 
Interface, Quality of products, Delivery and also everything that one is 
willing to have known about any product is very well kept and put forth 
that no one would face any problem in finding right information, be it item 
description, or seller ratings or reviews or pictures or anything, 
everything. Loved the app! In fact, the app made me the fan of Flipkart!"
Interface is great than Amazon so i like this app

"Nice and good interface of app and best place where we can buy our needs

their customer not seller regarding any products quality issue."

"With the increasing success I feel like their customer service is going 
down. I have faced a lot of harrassment on my previous order. I really need 
to speak to a customer care executive but they do not provide a number 
anymore. I left a request to be called back 1 week back but am yet to 
receive a call. I've been using Flipkart since the time they only sold 
books. I must say I am extremely extremely disappointed with the new 
interface."

improvements in user experience things."

attractive, eye friendly and wonderful."
Good user experience
"New Review Flipkart has gone a long way in last two years. nice offers n 
easy to use interface. Yet to check on return policy n returns 😁 which was 
troublesome earlier. Old review Rating is for flipkart service and return 
policy...... It's not buyers fault if he is getting a faulty product and 
neither should the buyer run around to get the product corrected..... The 
return should simply be accepted not rejected...... As per reviews many 
users are facing same return issues specially in case of mobiles...... 
Snapdeal is much better if compared...... Good luck to people buying on 
flipkart"
An awsome Marketing aap ..with an user friendly interface ..loved it
Good app for shopping & user interface is good but item costs are high
App user interface should be improved .
Good interface.. genuine products..
Excellent interface
"It offers more user friendly interface than amazon, filter helps to 
identify good according to price range and brand . 5*for ease of use......."
"Update: flipkart does not provide a proper gst invoice... So you can never 
get gst input credit... Cancelled the order for mobile Browsed a few 
categories but prices are higher compared to competitors. Eg searched for 
laptop most at list price few with discounts of 2-3%. With nonconventional 
methods of specs eg display size in cms instead of inches. Even the 
interface needs more work. You've to click a few times to get proper specs. 
Will uninstall it and probably check it in a month or two if it gets any 
better."

Flipkart app and interface is much better than Amazon
"First of all, we are only gonna talk about the app, and not the service, as 
it dosent come under Google play's jurisdiction. •A very well built app, 
clean and easily navigable interface and Good search. •My personal 
favourite; also the main reason I love shopping on Flipkart; is its perfect 
SORT AND FILTER menu, you can easily find exactly what you need in just a 
couple of checkboxes and search in great detail about the product you're 
looking for. •Other than that, arrangement of the Homepage, displaying 
ongoing offers is very comprehensive. •Specifications, ""In the Box"" options 
make you satisfied about your potential purchase. •Seller Details, Other 
sellers, Delivery Options, each and every menu format is perfect and very 
easy to converse. User-friendliness is going through the roof. Much Much 
better than any other App-Based e-commerce platform.Though I do 
occasionally use the other apps, ive never enjoyed shopping as much, 
anywhere else. Now Speaking about the Company Service: •Delivery Time is 
accurate for 80% of the Orders. •Packaging Quality and Handling needs 
Improvement. •Reliable Return, Replacement and post purchase service, ideal 
warranties and damage protection for products that need it. Refund, may 
sometimes become hassled and difficult. Customer Support is never up to the 
mark. •Product description is precise but Rating and Reviews look shady and 
Doubtful. •Theres no limit to product category expansion, keep going.

nice interface
Best e-commerce app I have used so far.The interface is even better than in desktop.
very clean interface of the app attractions the customer to shop
The interface of the app is better but I feel flip cart isn't good at offering better price than other ecom sites.
Good and easy user interface☺☺
Flipkart has improved a lot over the past years regarding delivery and user experience.
good user experience
Almost good service and good app but I think there should be an additional feature about price drop for each product and customer should have an option to opt for price drop and once there is drop in price there should be notification aboutprice drop.I think this feature can play handy role to improve user interface.
Very good interface . very good customer support
User friendly e-commerce app with a good user interface
Simple interface with Cool and easy to Browse Products
Great user interface compared amazon but only disappointment is that prices of product are higher when compared to amazon. Pay later option is good.

User friendly interface!
"Products are mostly as described. Delivery is also always on time, sometimes even early. Best part is refunding in case of any issues with the product. The interface of the app is also very simple and user-friendly. Great flipkart."
This app has the best interface than any other shopping app's
user interface is attractive
"Shopping experience is no doubt top notch with Flipkart. However, I feel product tracking details shown in the app is not as good as that shown in the website. The website offers a much better idea of tracking compared to the app. And I always have to access the website instead for that. If Flipkart is shifting completely to the app interface, I would like to see a more informative tracking details section. Thank You :)"
User friendly interface and good service
"Nice Platform for online shopping with great interface. Easy for shopping. But there is something that needs to be taken care. Most of the times i have found that even after adding the product to the cart it becomes out of stock. It should be ensured that once the product is added to the Cart, certain time limit should be given to check it out. Due to this issue many of the times, users come up with issues like wrong shipping details and many other problems. It's an advice to kindly work on it"
Best UI. User friendly interface. I think flipkart has best filter options in the world. Even Amazon can't come close in this matter.
user friendly and easy interface.
the interface is so smooth
"Nice shopping app. It not only shows nice varieties but also do its service in a most befitted manner. The user interface & other things are very simple & one can easily understand how to order , similarities, cancellation,few more. I jus have a request that though it has all the stuffs needed for us some varieties are there in Amazon,so getting those in flipkart will be much more useful."

nice interface and its atrack to the customers like me and reasonable prices also.
user friendly interface to acess variety of products...
Good interface and services while using this E-commerce App.
A few points I'd like to mention Cons: 1. Products relevant to purchased items are shown right after your purchase which is unnecessary as many don't care about it later. 2. Variation of delivery date even in higher tier cities. 3. Way less focus on the details of the products. Pros: 1. Shipping service is good and packaging is reliable. 2. Interface of the app is too good to make people leave the application. 3. Advertisements or any kind of distractive content is out of the way.
best user interface for online shopping
Good interface and easy to find products.

App interface is very good. It is much better than that of Amazon. But the choice of goods is not up to the mark. They dont have even some basic products. The delivery is also pathetic. It took more than 3 days even to dispatch a product from seller. I ordered a pair of sunglasses that took more than 15 days to arrive.

It is great for shopping. One of the most pure user interface integration ever.I can seriously tell you amazon is getting a bit stale. Flip kart is more on a new side. Just for saying things released are freshly available here. Only minor upgrades needed.

user friendly purchasing things for my nee place and i am impressed with the interface
"Need to enhance user experience by modifying the graphics and fixing the bug such as filtered search gets refreshed if any item is viewed in detail, It starts from the first item istead the last viewed item. Need to have pop message about how many items available in the given list and exactly where the user is currently in that list for e.g. 45/500. There are more suggestions to give but in short compare your app with Myntra and implement thier features your sale will go much higher."
"I bought lots of stuff using this App, books mostly and it works flawless. Interface is good too. Keep up the good work guys. Cheers."
Good user experience
Nice app and user interface. Ordered many times and got very ggod products at a very good price and at very good quality.Plus membership is too good. Many benefits of plus membership. But one cons. is that if you choose two or more items from different sellers and brand under 500 the delivery chatges are also there but they said above 500 cart value no delivery charges. They are cheating in this case remaining all excellent.Also the best time to buy is sales like Big billion days.

"I'm a regular flipkart user. Sometimes I've got different products than what I actually ordered by seeing the image, this happens with flipkart assured items also. Also they should remove the maximum limitation of only 10 coins per order. Other than that, the variety of products, the user interface, price, shipping quality is good."

Simply superb interface to browse..Never gets bored while searching for products
"Flipkart is Most Trusted But Amazon OffersBetter Experience, Survey Finds. India's homegrown e-commerce player Flipkart is now the most trusted Indian e-tailing brands but rival Amazon offers better user experience, according to a recent study. ... Both companies were, however, tied as India's most trusted brand in metros"
Flipkart is just nightmare. we ordered laptop and they cancelled delivery in the end moment and saying can't deliver because you have ordered in bulk. even they don't have system where they can check customer order. when I called they are making new story. I ordered more than 1 Lakh Laptop and they are treating like local vendor. I am taking action if they are making delay in payment refund. don't use Flipkart as they this totally fraud website. use Amazon. Amazon has good user experience .
keeps asking me to install the app... too much incovenience.. app isnt gr8 either. Now they have deleted mobile website too.. Dint like the app. Showz only what they wanna show. Dint like the interface. edit : app has become good now.
"Smooth interface, several times better than Amazon. There are out of the box info on the products which aids in choosing the right product. And above all, it's an Indian firm, so I'm hell bent on driving away monopoly of the US based Amazon on my soil."
User friendly interface. Good service.
colour full and speedy interface

"Great app with great offers. However, at times I have faced issues relating to interface but recently I found exploring thorough the app a smooth sailing. About the concerns related to originality of products I think it's a challenge either on any online marketing site or in any local store. You can be ripped off any where. However, I have had no issues contesting my case with Flipkart whenever such a situation arose."
"Nice User Interface , Just Awesome ,Love it"
Easy interface to use. To improve - the prices reflected on the main screen are generally ranges and not specific. Can reflect the actual price to avoid multiple ups and downs.
User experience and Ease of shopping is at its best in Flipkart.

Best Online Shopping Application with Simple User Interface
Very friendly user interface. Felt very lively while using it.
"Best user interface for online shopping. Excellent range to choose from and incredibly, free delivery on next morning. May it remain the same under Walmart. Amazon failed to deliver an order even after two weeks and several complaints. Strangely they asked me to rate my experience on the date of expected delivery. They are clueless about their vendors activity and failed to respond to my repeated complaints. Long live Flipkart."
I m fully satisfied with this app & the interface is user friendly

User friendly interface with range of quality products on competitive price has made it a overall great experience while shopping on FlipKart. Eye-catching offers are add-on to ameliorate its magnetic effect on payers.
easy to navigate app... awesome interface
The review on Flipkart shouldn't be trusted. I submitted a review for a product long back and Flipkart denied to publish it because it was a negative review. However i never had any issues with thier delivery. Also their app looks very beautiful and visually appealing. But mostly you will find the same item at a cheaper price in Amazon. Amazon's interface is a bit dull and boring though
user experience on this app is better than Amazon's user experience.
"Good user interface, with flipkart pay later option, faster process, good prices comparatively other websites."

After using flipkart for at least 6 years...I can say that the overall experience is good. Being the Indian company it has given a tough competition to giants like Amazon. Let me tell you what I like the best in Flipkart: 1. The user experience because of rich UI is awesome. Features like compare to is very helpful. Right things at the right place. I am fond of its UI. 2. The service is on the next level. Till date all good experience. So keep it up because this is the key to hold customers.

worst user experience. I bought a k20 pro from Flipkart(FK).since i had an offer for icici card i paid using it . Even though the cash was deducted my order was not placed. i tried twice but just getting a notification that your order cant be placed and refund will happen in 4-5 days. After which i tried the same using citi card and my order is placed . M not sure it's a scam or a glitch and your customer support really sucks ( wait time: atleast 4 hours). I will make sure noone i know uses FK.
great app . Very fluent and easy to use interface

Flipkart has since reactivated the mobile site. The interface on the app is clean and user-friendly. Good range of products too.
"Good Service,Need to improve user interface"

Awesome shopping experience. punctual customer care.I am happy with user experience as well

"Better user experience than Amazon. My first choice would be Flipkart, no lags in app, can contact to delivery boy on delivery day and asking for suitable time."
Good app interface but need to work more on categories list. Categories list should be large and should come to eye. Ads size should be small. ☺️
Fast and Easy Interface
super app for shopping and simple interface
really nice user interface. very easy to use. good products and services
amazon interface is better than flipkart. irritating with login credential mismatch. i don't find any solution even after using forget password option. worst application. you should open retail outlets instead of selling online.

"Neat app, easy search, sufficient information and yes, user friendly interface!!"
nice interface
Horrible interface and bright colours. Item removed from cart still shows as notification count. Pathetic. Learn something from Amazon. Oh.. and get some good designers to design your app.. Its cluttered!!
The degree of excellence of user interface
"I love the interface, it's easy to navigate, not cluttered. Better looking than ES Explorer. I originally accused this app of a terrible adware pop-up insertion. At least twice as soon as I closed this app a giant ad popped up almost the size of the screen prompting me to try out a game. I now believe it was a coincidence. I reinstalled it on a new device and the situation has NOT repeated itself. I now think that device was infected by some other app. This is a GREAT file manager! Highly recommended!!"
Awesome User Interface

Nice Interface but load problem after every 2 to 3 days

I like its interface and service.
"Literally the only reason I used this app was because I'd received a gift card from someone, but my prejudice against Flipkart was only reaffirmed. App interface is substandard, and there are several bugs, causing it to crash. Every single order I've placed over the last six months failed in the first attempt with the amount debited. Processing of refund also takes inordinately long."
Found a 'Book' which I couldn't buy on amazon. Great user experience.
App experience has become excellent. Smooth interface.
"App interface is far much better than Amazon. Just two suggestion to development team. When ever user edit or view something in wishlist, wishlist starts from the beginning. 2nd if user can get option or make folders to categories their products in wishlist that would be very helpful same like Amazon"

"user interface, prompt delivery."
Amazing.... Good user interface....
Really disappointed with the app while searching for a laptop specifically. There's no filter option to select intel 9th gen or 10th gen in laptop. Laptop filter on the basis of intel 9th or 10th gen is not possible here. Really disappointed. Very frustrating user experience here with laptop selection.
How do you manage to be so useless. Such a crappy user interface. Firstly you again and again deliver me wrong product. One doesn't have so much of time to keep doing this and get into useless hassle of complaining where you cannot expect anything as it is so useless. If you can help..kindly take the packet back and get me a refund.
Nice and easy interface
one of the best indian B2B portal and trustable apps for a online shopping . Also easy and user friendly apps interface
Just okay with the services it provides and just a simple suggestion to make the app interface design a little more modern and contemporary.

Nice interface and good service
Flip Cart has best service. staffs are good. Timely delivery. Fine products. Attractive app interface. !!!👌👌👌
"User Experience feedback: When user traverse through the list of pages inside the app, user has to reverse back to all these pages to come back on home page. This is bit annoying user experience, as user has no way to reach home page of app in single click. And this is because, hamburger menu is only available on home page of the app. Generally, Hamburger menu has list of items, which links to all root level pages. And so this menu has to be consistently available on all the pages. In fact, all the android phone has hardware back button, so you may also not need to provide back button in top navigation. Instead of back button, in top navigation, for android app, put hamburger menu there."
Good user experience
Very well user interface and glad to shop with flipkart
The app and it's interface is good but flipkart delivery is delayed as compared to Amazon
"Good app interface. Very detailed product description for electronics and great clear high res images of products. And, the filter mechanism is BEST IN CLASS amongst the slew of online marketplace aggregators."

"Very bad user experience. Payment issue not resolved. Extremely dissatisfied and disappointed with this kind of service where money is deducted within 2seconds and requires 24hours wait for confirmation. Payment was immediately marked successful on googlepay with Transaction I'd. Even after providing all details, issue couldn't be resolved quickly. Is this the ""benefit"" of online transaction? Well, I guess COD is 100times better."
"In terms of customer user experience easy and friendly to use, filters working fine and yes i loved the pay later option👌"
Nice improvement for user interface.

"Nice app,Better than Amazon's user interface."
Very nice UI design and best quality products.. Excellent user interface and functionality App is very responsive..
Specially i like the user interface which very much short and simple. Payment and return policies is awesome. I could given 5 star but u have introduced video and idea which is irrelevant. Its shopping site so pls focus only on shopping for other things launch separate app
Simple ans lucid to use interface. Love the experience
"Huge collection,best price..best interface to choose"
Flipkart has got best user interface. I personally love this app because of fast delivery and till now whatever I've ordered I've got it in best price and best condition.

User friendly interface
Nice interface and good experience
"This app has the most amazing user experience, their UI makes me want to open their app at least once a day, the products and offers are amazing, everything from clothes to groceries are good and are delivered on time, their customers support is very good and very helpful. Love this app"
There is no Home button. This makes the interface very annoying. Whenever I have to go to home i have to keep pressing back again and again. So navigation becomes annoying. Improve this otherwise these little things makes Amazon way better than Flipkart.
Best user experience
Good app even more simplified with more features. Now I like it. The interface is now user friendly.
Smooth interface
So lag and hard to browse in the app .. the ui is good but even if my network is good and device is smoothy only the flipkart app is too slow loading the product and soo laggy interface
I found flipkart's user interface better than Amazon thanks.
Awesome user interface
Better user experience and use easy and believble app
"Nice app, with good user interface.."
Flipkart is my fav shopping app. Its clean and comfortable to use. The interface is so user-friendly too
"To be clear, this review is only regarding current ANDROID APP 7.2, NOT Flipkart's Service. Since last 2-3 updates, the app has been extremely slow, laggy, takes ages to load a page. Even on a very fast broadband connection on a flagship device, it is taking a lot of time to load a product page, or search results. Uninstalling and re-installing the app had no effect. This is particularly bothersome, because this app used to be the fastest online shopping app in terms of UI and user experience."
This app give me all things i want very easy in use nice interface and this app show good price at all time
It's a cool app User experience with this app 👌
smooth interface
"When I see the interface of Amazon, i always appreciate Flipkart for its user friendly interface"

Wonderful user experience
The service and interface is best but sometimes amazon have the same product s at cheaper price Otherwise i would give you guys 5 star☺️
i like flipkart. but its still not as polished as amazon apps and its website. i would like flipkart to improve user experience in both apps and websites. i would like flipkart to be a very good competitor to amazon. and Others. specially for india it is the best chance for it to become a global company.

interface must be improved
User experience is better than that of Amazon or other online retailers especially I like the 'product search and filters' feature.
The interface is very user friendly and helpful but I'm giving it 4 stars because items go out of stock very fast. I wanted to buy the Poco x2 phone and I have been waiting for 1 month yet there is no new stock since the phone first went out of stock. Except for the stocks everything is perfect Good job Flipkart

Bhai interface mast he
"Good for basic purchases. Still prefer seeing the product I am buying on a bigger screen so that I don't end up buying the wrong colors with clothes. For other stuff this is just great. Wish they would add an option to calculate with shipping while sorting by price or an option to filter for free shipping only. Great filters on tech items, much better user experience while searching for mobiles, tablets and microwave ovens compared to nearest competitor."
Very easy interface user friendly and simple transitions...quick payment options 👍👍👍
"Outstanding delivery process , user friendly interface of app . Customer care facility is fantabulous . I love it . Every time I am eager to order something new from Flipkart . Thank you all the team of Flipkart."

Few people keep complaining about missing deliveries, bad quality, etc. That happens even with Amazon also. I'm buying on Flipkart since 2015 and I didn't find any issue. I hope Flipkart maintain the same in the future also. Thanks!"
"Best online shopping app, very nice user interface"

"Very easy to use interface. Millions of products are available wirh free delivery as well as cash on delivery. You will also earn points with every order, which can be used in next purchase for taking discounts."
Good experience. Good products. Good service. Nice user interface for app
"Compulsory filters. The user interface is very crowded. Too many pictures. They overdo it. It's very local and annoying. No quality. You cannot see products of only a specific brand - even if you filter to see one brand, it'll compulsorily show a few extra brands which might have paid them some money to make their products visible. Very bad way to market. Poor quality user interface. Please take down unnecessary images and advertisements and make it a better place to shop."
"User experience is Amazing , I can search the things very easily , great navigation"
Best app for shopping.app interface very good👌👌👌
Awesome experience We get to know about every sale live through notifications. Easy to use User friendly interface.
I am trying to buy mobile but it's not deliverable. I don't know why now? Lockdown has open and evey e-commerce started to delivering at my address but your are still un deliverable. Very poor User experience!
"Good user experience, just one suggestion, please add 'cash on delivery availability' option on products in Filters, to cut down browsing time for those who are still interested in COD option."

The worst app in the history of Google app store.

"App interface is awesome. I was stuck to Amazon, but just because of good service of Flipkart i have ordered more than 15 items. Im so pleased with Flipkart service nd payment operations."
"Since the Walmart have acquired due stakes of Flipkart, it has improved in many parameters which include: 1) User Interface 2) Product Portfolio 3) Website/App navigation 4) Customer review database handling 5) QnA section for each product in review section Overall I can say now the Flipkart is gearing up to give some good competition to the market leader Amazon with its new armour for the war known as Market Share... Best of luck to Flipkart"
Great user interface

"Easy to use , informative and attractive user interface is the highlight of this application."
Nice interfaces and servuce
Very nice interface excellent deals would have given 5 stars but lately a lot of my orders placed during sale got cancelled repeatedly even when lockdown was completely lifted and flipkart was fully functional by sellers just on grounds of unforseen issues though in reality it was due to sale price
Almost every product is available here and at reasonable price but wishlist interface is not convenient to use.
Best app interface.
Very nice app user experience!
"Improvement is needed in providing most relevant searches based on given search string by user. Explore the option of giving customizable home screen interface for long time users of application. It really frustrating to see too much clutter of criteria, choices on load. All the best Original Indian org. 🙂 Keep pushing up the great work! 👍"
Good with interface
Best user interface
Very user-friendly interface and so many filters available for each product so we can easily sort out it from huge list. And so far I got good products only that's too at reasonable price. Thanks to Flipkart.
Excellent interface easy findings good offers. Better when compared to amazon
Very good user experience
"Best experience, easy user interface"

Very good user interface of the App. Awesome.
Best thing is user interface of Flipkart. Easy to find. Still now no problem 😊

It can deliver upto more places where Amazon's delivery is not available. Very very clean user interface and have excellent discounts on all the products.
Good interface and fast user experience
Doesn't have nice user interface
The interface is awesome. The Filter mode is far more categorised than rival apps. Customer care is responsive most of the times.
"I like the app and it's interface, Cheers"
Better interface than it's rivals and easy navigation.
The apk interface is amazing and smoth
Literally unusable.. you cannot open anything as it takes ages. I have a 40 Mbps fiber broadband and still it doesnt work. It just says hang on loading content. The website doesnt give the same user experience so I am forced to look at other shopping sites. Its a shame the app doesnt work other wise flipkart is excellent.
This is a Very useful and premium app As compared to the others and its interface is very cool
New interface for wishlist items are worst.. unable know product is in stock or not. Fix soon
Very good user experience 👍
Simply Awsm..... User interface is way cool.....
Good customer service and app interface
Excellent variety. Good interface.
Always loved the interface
Very neat and easy interface
"I used Flipkart more than Amazon. Main reason to use Flipkart is user-friendly interface and also good service. They're offered card less credit for me. From the beginning of I faced lots of problems with card less credit. Every month if you paid your dues, in their system not updating balance until you have to contact customer care 4 or 5 times. Now my two months payment not updated in the system and i raised complaints more than 5times. Second thing they are not provide your credit SOA."
User interface is pretty good. Delivery time is also decent
Very good interface and easy results. i am happy
Love the app and it's user interface
Good interface
good app. Nice interface also
"Everytime I open the app, it notifies me to update. No other app does like that. The developers must understand that while using an app, a customer should be provided the home interface and nothing else. Updation can be reminded once in a while but it is happening every time."
Flipkart is the best in terms of app and website interface and of course in products and services
Good interface
User interface is amazing thanks to flipkart for such an amazing interface
Its always a feel good using flipkart for shopping and comparing as well. User interface and overall experience is best s a cusotmer to me
"New interface is not good, wishlist is not shown properly , whether its in stock or not like it used be earlier"
New interface very good
I love it products and user experience.. Nice price
"Flipkart just got bad after latest update , wishlist interface just worst can't do much about that , plz guys bring back the old interface of wishlist menu , I just totally hate this one , I literally uninstalled it twice but have to download because I love your services , but you guys are doing wrong changes in my opinion"
"It's a great app for online shopping. Gives me the best user experience, offers wide range of varieties and the deals offered are just mouth-watering!!! Loved this one!!!😁"
"I am a flipkart User since 2018 and a plus user since 2019, the reason I use this app is its user interface which attracts anybody at a first glance and its ease of reaching customer support executive."
Flipkart user experience is way better than amazon
Best UI .. and user experiences are greatful
The application is wonderful. Found no flaws regarding user interface and compatibility....just one thing- navigation could have been more specific. Whenever we choose any product and view it in detail then after returning to the former page we have to start from the beginning of the page again. If fixed it will be perfect.
Tye interface is user friendly
I like the offers available in this app and the interface is better than amazon
"It apps interface speed has improved Recently. Is it at the cost of security, hope not."
Ease of browsing products. User friendly filters. Premium packing and delivery system. Fantastic user experience.
Excellent interface and very affordable.
Not bad...a good app interface...but there is no certain good offers for plus members...there is access for early sale thats good
"The packaging of flipkart is too good , I love the interface of flipkart yaar ! , It's so easy and simple Replacement is a worryless thing in flipkart 😍"
User interface is so good
Good user interface
Very user friendly interface
Great UI and user experience. Works really smooth.
Very user friendly interface
"Tum ka ghatia aep banaya baabi, tumareko aep banane ko nahi areda🤮💩 The user interface is awful to say the least. When one views an item on the wish list, and proceeds to explore related products on the bottom of that page, and returns to the list, it commences from the very beginning. This is only one of the plethora of UI related issues I could list. I suggest you make amends immediately as this is poses quite an inconvenience."
Worst user experience
Awesome User Interface. Easy to order. Easy to manage.
Easy interface app
"App was good, until the recent update, which changed the wishlist interface. The update adds a tab for grouping wishlist items, which is good, but the actual wishlist view itself is bad. Hope the previous style will be reverted back to."
I like flipkart services very much. And the new services of super coins is much better Their interface is top of all shopping apps like amazon shopclues snapdeal etc
We use app because it has better interface than webs. Exprience in shopping through app is way better than web.
Interface can be improved like myntra ....
It's taking much time to open the app. And clothes collections are worst like some wholesale bazaar. While they have the 2GUD for such stuff. Atleast team needs to work on this refining part to improve user experience.
Loved the user interface. Awsome experience......
Great app and great user experience
With best prices and User interface we can purches products
Very easy to shop. User interface is very comfortable
Nice interface of the app and product choice is also awesome
"User Interface is highly impressive. Some algorithms which is like last visit product, most like products, are needed improvements. Overall experience with flipkart is good. Try to use new tech stacks for Frontend development, it will give the best user interfaces."
Great User Interface... Nice E Procurement App. User friendly UI makes it popular. It is very good than Amazon App
"1, Overall Easy interface. 2, Product description and image quality is very good. 3, Please improve your homepage."
App with friendly interface...
Too easy interface and hassle free payments
Easy to use interface and perfectly organised👍
I like the interface and its good for shopping
Better user interface when compared to Amazon
Extremely awesome interface but nowadays the stocks are rarely available and the flash sale is very disappointing (You should give atleast 1 minute time in doing payments like amazon does). If this continues flipkart will be way behind in the e-commerce race
Great user experience from my side
Nice app he have many products and delivery service are very fast and simple interface for use this app 👌👌👌
Not liking the new wishlist interface on the phone. It is not showing all the products and it is very time taking to categorize the products into collection. Older one was best
I used Flipkart long back and using now again. User Experience and Pricing both are very good 👍
APP's INTERFACE IS FABULOUS.. THE DELIVERY IS ON THE RIGHT TIME CUSTOMER EXECUTIVE ARE WELL SPOKEN AND HUMBLE. FLIPKART JUST GETS YOU ALL THE THINGS DONE.
Good interface
User friendly interface
Best user experience for an ecommerce app. Far better UI than Amazon.

"I have used almost every shop. app inclding myntra, amazon, limeroad,nyka ,snapdeal and flipkart. Acco. to me the best is flipkart you dont have to worry at all . has a good interface and trusted delivery part. Myntra has bery high rates for almost ery prdct, amazon takes much more delivery charges, limeroad is the worst dont ever try to use it they will cheat you with there useless offers like cut the price, nyka is good op. for cosmetics, and sanpdeal may give you fake prdct. hope it helps ❤"
Quick interface
Very nice service and interface for users and delivery before the expected date.
"Improved a lot from before, extremely user friendly UI navigation and good user experience compared to all other rival e-commerce apps"

no other online shopping app has an interface which is as customer friendly as this app. loved it :)
"Very good site to buy things, and easy return options. User friendly interface, overall nice shopping site. 👌"
Bad user experience. One of my friend just bought a new smartphone from this platform. And she got a defective one. Now their are not even responding to her queries neither refunding the amount. Flipkart sucks.........
Great search and user friendly interface!
User interface is pretty good.
The user experience and service quality increasing everyday
Good and cool user interface
Flipkart app has the smoothest user interface with easy acess to multiple category of products.
If I have to choose between Amazon and Flipkart I will choose Flipkart Bcz they have user friendly interface and I love there theme too
"One of the best online shopping site, attractive user interface"
"I am glad that you have provided your services in Tamil, Telugu and other regional languages in India. Now please provide your services and interface in Marathi which is official language of Maharashtra."
Good to shop and nice User experience
"All efforts are to create more business. Little or no effort on supporting customers or making the entire experience better for them. The option to get help (call, chat) is burried deep inside the App. No human interface. Stupid chat bots that can't really help you. Not a great experience."
Hardly any human interface. Doesnt look like they care for the business I give them. Maybe they have become too big to care any more.
"Add Marathi language to your interface, otherwise we will not buy products from your site"
Very smooth and timely delivery experience with Flipkart and nice interface to search.
Great app interface is very good. Everyone can go through it.
Its interface and product quality and customer service is good

User friendly interface
"Good range of products, offers, best service and fast delivery. User Interface can be better. Please give advisory on products 'Made in India'. Kindly stop selling chinese products. We are ready to compromise on product range and quality for now. #madeinindia #promoteindia #supportindia #makeinindia #indianproducts #manufactureinindia #banchineseproducts #stopsellingchineseproducts #banchina #banchinese #banoneplus #banmi #stopsellingchinesemadeproducts #banvivo #banoppo #banpoco #banxiaomi"
"I'm editing my review now. Actually user interface, filter options are really best. But please compare your product prices with other apps like amazon. Both of you are having same concept of picking up items from nearby shop, pack them, and deliever it to customer. Then why your prices are bit higher. Please check them. Otherwise everything is good. Sorry for the one star but i needed your attention only. Hope you will see this review."
The best interface
I always love flipkart.Very good user interface when compared to others.
"Flipkart is the best app to shop for.... Team seem to have done lot of hard work to built and maintain such an awesome app .. In terms of User experience, offer, products, quality, rewards, discount, return policy....u guys r awesome.....pls keep up the goo d work and u will always stay top of all your competitors 😀"

"Better than amazon in interface atleast, same in other ways."
"It has a great product range, and a pretty decent user - interface"
Good . Need to work more on user interface and easy navigation. Good luck.
"The app and its interface is quite user-friendly.... But the courier service they chose for delivering the items, is not so good in our locality though its close to the city."
The delivery takes time . Maybe it's due to the lockdown . But it's okay. I like the interface better than other ecommerce sites. It's lively . It is easy and well arranged . Kudos 👍
It's good and this user interface I like also. But try to improve ur style. I love ur interface style. Thanks

Flipkart app User interface issue Give Some time for Payment in Flash sale i have too buy Mobile in Flash Sale But in Payment Page Product Out Of stock So Please Give Atleast 5 Min For Payment Process
Fabulous application easy user interface and smooth to handle and also cheap prices. Compared to physical market.
There is no confirmation or an email after the payment. And the delivery people was not all educated that there was an option of online payment and they were asking me cash even though I paid online. Poor user experience. Customer support would like to get back in 72 hrs. But what should I do at the present situation when delivery person is standing at my door. Super customer satisfaction delivered.
You guys can add improvements in application's user interface!
Nice app interface
Nice interface and service
This app provides the best user experience and security.

"Writing this review after using Flipkart for 2 years, Mistakes occurs that is human nature., I've received defective product many times, But how these people handling that issue and sorting out is amazing. Their sleek refined interface and search option is the most like feature of Flipkart according to me. Thanks for giving nice experience throughout the year..."

"The interface is simple. I like it. I want you to add a link to the home page. After placing a order, going back to home page is not straightforward. Most of the time I exit the app then again open it to go to the home page."
"Where Ever product delivery is not possible Please try to inform before to users so that users will stop wasting there time for sale. For example today there is sale on 12 pm for realme narzo 10, I have waited there for this product and on 12PM its saying we can't deliver this product to your location. Just sharing user experience."
Good interface and easy application
Amazing user experience
Home interface too flashy and distracting. Otherwise good.
Nice interface
Nice user interface
Very Good App for Shopping with a nicely designed interface.
"They are not delivering the items even in stipulated time. And calling customer care is a joke. They gimmick by saying that call is not audible where I can clearly hear them, even the keyboard typing sound. I have even recorded the call. Not expecting such user experience from then."
"Great app, great offers. I liked the user interface and the smooth payment process."

"I luv this app.... Nice interface, user friendly and smooth... Also comes up with creative things every now and then... Thanks flipkart"
The Interface is really awesome...But the service is quiet compressed... Feels good if the Customer service got cleared fast...And the delivery was late as compared to others e-services:-(
"I am not giving this rating for the user interface of application, I am giving this for the service of the flipkart because I have order a phone whose delivery has not been done and they are saying that they raised the problem and I'll get the feedback after 7 days. There customer support is disgusting now a days earlier it was OK but now its terrible. This of for flipkart service.🙏"
Very useful interface. I always prefer for this site for continuing my shopping..

I feel flipkart better than amazon and all other online shopping apps User interface is very simple Suggestions are accurate Sometimes offers are fabulous I like this App
The user interface is not user friendly after update. The major issue is in wishlist tab the prices or availability of product don't auto update after the recent update the section became more complicated. I don't know why they do this earlier it was more easy to use.
"Happy with the app, easy to use and find. Interface is even better than amazon."
"Good app and good interface ,easy to use ☺️"
Interface is excellent. Super products with great service
ADDING ITEMS IN WISHLIST IS TOO TOO TOO TOO DIFFICULT NOW THAN BEFORE. USER INTERFACE IS SO DIFFICULT NOW. NOT SO SMOOTH LIKE EVER BEFORE. NEED IMPROVEMENTS.

The user experience along with faster money refunds and best customer support
Been using the app since years. It justifies the expectation considering the brand popularity. The overall experience was easy & the interface is loaded with features.
User interface is super. It showing large numbers of categories. User should have an option to choose categories based on his interests that he wish to display in the app.
Pretty simple interface with good offers and easy checkout..... Recommended.
best platform to buy electronic goods and I like the interface mostly
App interface was Good but delivery service very bad.
Very easy user interface... Go for it.
Great user experience with awesome customer support.. one suggestion that you can add more varieties of products..well done Flipkart🤟
As compared to rival user interface is great of app
Very easy and conviniant the interface is user friendly with all the details
Probably the best app in user interface. And you can see product more clearly than the amazon app. But sometimes the prices of products are slight higher than amazon.
Clean interface is good one of the best shopping app
My experience with flipkart is good so far. The offers & app interface are superb. One con I met is....we don't have any option to delete selected order history ( This is needed for our privacy purpose).
Flipkart is the best in business. I chose Flipkart over other e-commerce site any day. And it's app user interface and the courier services are the best in the market.
Very good 👍 users interface app
The UI interface is pretty good which makes shopping easier.
Beatyful interface n really user freindly experiece

Very useful app with a simple & powerful interface.
Better interface compared to other online shopping applications
"Range of products, offers, user experience on mobile application is best."
Flipkart is no less than a boon for Indian users. Its interface is very simple to buy any product which people of any age can easily use. I have been using it for the last three years. Looks like some products do not bear my delivery charge which is a good thing I will recommand everyone.you can join this platform without higitation......
"I bought a ""Flipkart SmartBuy Edge To Edge Tempered Glass for Samsung Galaxy M21, Samsung Galaxy M31 (Pack of 1)"". I received this item in a broken condition. Flipkart is not allowing to return this item as this falls under No Return policy. Now the point is, there is no support from Flipkart that if the item is received in a broken condition then what is customer's fault? And why do customer face his/her money loss??? Customer rely on Flipkart for a better service and user experience and therefore, I did not order the same thing from any other applications because I wanted to purchase it from an Indian App. But getting this negative experience m forced to use any other non Indian App like Amazon and others. Flipkart at least provide a way to talk to the customer care in all possible combinations. I hope for a positive reply from Flipkart team."
"Easy to use, Good User Interface and also plus membership is good."
"It's a very good shopping app, with a nice user interface"
"Nice app , nice user interface 👍🏻"
"Best selection of products, best interface and most importantly best customer support team."
The interface is good
A good and a friendly user interface for frequent orders of goods around the world
I love purchase in Flipkart!! Because four reasons..... 1.Interface 2.offers 3.delivery 4.super coins.....
Very bad user experience. Issues are not resolved even after multiple requests.
Great app with easy user interface
Grocery purchase was an aweome user experience

Responsive Easy to Use User Interface
Good user experience 😌
"Beside abnormal delay in delivery, false update on the Flipkart, unwarranted advice for cancellation of order to hide the fact of delay. However positive, polite, and logical acceptance of Faulty despatch and delay was positive action. Mr Vivek, who became interface and expedited shipping, delivery, and due resolution deserves huge appreciation who turned negative situation to a positive end Louds endeavours of Mr Vivek. Col BN Sharma"
I like user interface of this app...it makes easy for a layman to place orders..
"Slow interface, late delievry."
"Good app for shopping and its layout ,arrengment and interface so good compair to amazon app"
App's interface is very friendly and easy to browse.
"Good and automated product suggestions and good user interface. I've ordered for the the forst time from Flipkart..if it good ,, I'll continue with the same platform..."
It's awesome to other applications And I usually orders by this application. And I haven't face any problems during delivery and order time . It's too simple . Thanks to all of you developers to make esay interface of this application.
Flipkart is more user friendly than Amazon! Like their interface and also prices are comparatively lesser on certain products.
"User interface is just unique and have an indian touch unlike Amazon app... With the period of time..... in consumer experience, flipkart rules in India.... Enjoy Shopping"
Nice......User Interface is Good👍
Good user experience and good customer value. Like it very much.
This app is awesome 👍🆗 very good The user interface is awesome very clear products
Nice interface
Good but lot of catching up to do with amazon in terms of delivery time and app interface and app journey
New version is nice. Deliveries are fast and the app interface is more user friendly.
Excellent good interface
Superb user experience
Customer Services is just pathetic as it displays just standard options. Doesn't have an option for account related problems like updating phone number or email id. Why does it need to ask for older phone number while updating to newer number. My older number is lost/ don't have access to it. And I cant even take this up with customer service as the complaints helpdesk is automated to reflect only some standard options with problems customers face. No match for competitor's user interface.
It is now more user friendly and buttery smooth...interface.
"Best app for online shopping, and the user interface is much better than any other shopping app. 🤗🤗"
Application Interface is more attractive than other shopping apps. Also good.
Simple interface and easy way to pay
"App is nice overall, interface needs to improve little bit but great range of products"
awesome app i like this app more than amazon because its interface is fast and i feel like it is growing exponentially and will become the no 1 online shopping app.
Thoda app ka interface me halka change ho sakhe to dekho aur lite karne ka bhi dekhana app
User friendly interface
"Easy,friendly and lovely user interface.Good customer care support.Perfect genuine products delivered with less exception."

User friendly interface...
"Easy to use, clear interface, good customer suppott"
Great user interface it has grown alot since they started

Worst experience. Late delivery of products. Misguided interface / unprofessionally listed items just to increase their sales. I found Amazon better in every term.

Awesome user interface and easy to use. Best shopping app in the whole world.. Loved it
Awesome app ... I m really glad about this services... delivery before date... And user friendly interface
Nice interface
Nice interface overall a good package for shopping .
Very good user interface for product details and delivery of a product is fast when compared to Amazon but prices are bit more high
"App interface is overall good, but tracing of the ordered package should be more precise like it is reached at this state or town. The delivering time of the product is more than the other online shopping apps. I hope This upgrade will be really great help to customers."
Good interface..
Im feel smooth interface and feeling like real shopping on every products thank u
"Gud deals,fast nd smooth interface are nyc"
Best app to online Shopping ..best interface..

Very good interface ... User friendly app ..
Can improve user interface
Great Shopping app Easy to use and attractive interface
Amazefull experience is going on........ Loving it. Real Fashion Capital Of India. Best than Amazon. But little cons are there which are not recognizable. Smooth and swift interface.
Very bad experience. The user interface is awesome but delivery time is very long plus Flipkart has started to delay the deliveries. Now it takes around 14-20 days .
An indian app with better user interface
"Trustworthy,easy interface and quick response. Conclusion: Best online shopping app"
"First of all I thank you Flipkart for the amazing service. The offers you get on Flipkart are exceptional. The User Interface is neat and clean, and you find easily what you are looking for. You get exactly what you order. The most amazing thing is the Flipkart Plus service and offers, also the Credit facility you get. Just one recommendation, please add EMI service on the credit you provide. Would appreciate it. Thanks once again."
Interface is more friendly than Amazon . Fast delivery and return policy is up to the mark.
Lol why my orders are not deliverable to my address after ordering even 10 times but now it interface only not deliverable
The user interface is far better than Amazon
App interface is best
"Simply better than Amazon, much cleaner interface. Better range of products"
"I cant use Flipkart gift card balance to pay utility bills because you route me to MobiKwik interface. Amazon lets users pay from within the app and that too using gift card balance, because they value user convenience. Pls get inspired to do good like them. Also, how can ypu even think of starting a grocery supermarket without bothering to load Amul cheese & milk products?? I mean shouldn't that be step one?"
Very nice interface. Easy to operate. Now new helpful features. I like it. Can reduce delivery charge a bit
User friendly interface
nice interface👍
Interface. Is very good but some time flipkart delivery time exceed too much .a
"Like the user interface, easyto access menus, prompt cancellation refunds, wide range of products, attractive pricing, timely deliveries."
Awesome App But You Want To Provide Dark Mode Because Its Interface Is Too Bright It Gives Stress On Eye's When I'm Using In Low Light Conditions
Really good interface
Nice app interface is very good we can solve issue with any product to the customer care in seconds the customer care services autowired to the customers is very fast I like this app and get it five star
Good user interface
Love this app. Very friendly interface.
Old wishlist interface was better
Great app for indian people with great interface and easy handling
"Flipcart offers the best user experience in terms of ui and the payments,delivery services and product overview is awesome.The most wonderful this is now the delivery guy knows my home and he delivers the product by just ringing the bell..without any unnecessary phonecalls.👍🌠"
"This app the most appropriate and has a easy interface to make the orders.Love it .And Thank you, Flipkart.You have helped me a lot.Thank you."
Easy to Use.... Good interface
"The User interface of the app is worst, so many bugs and issues the site works very slow, their employees are not working properly"
Easy to order | User Experience is good | VocalforLocal
The user experience is great in this app
I like your user interface. Personally I find your UI better than Amazon UI.
Best interface than amazon
Best app best interface
Service is good but the problem is with the interface. I wanna buy an electronic device and the product description says that the COD is available but at the same time in the payment portal COD is not available. Please make sure what is being displayed before someone makes their mind to buy it but due to lack of payment options they can't purchase it. Electronics are costly and one cannot always rely on netbanking. Dissapointed.
great experienced.. very well user interface
Good user experience
I never used Flipkart till 3 months ago because I disliked its interface. But it has been improved a lot now and I now prefer it over other platforms.

Very slow interface... Not user friendly and counter intuitive...
Worst login interface
Worst interface. Searching for tv and it shows tv store with no show all options. No matter how much I try I land up on the same page. Also grocery is highly overpriced when compared with other grocery shopping apps.
User friendly interface
Very nice user experience and collection
very good experience I love flipkart Love to shop here It's so easy and has user friendly interface
Very easy interface
awesome and quite good and fast and user friendly interface but there is some bug in review system. I like to shop and like to post review but flipkart dose not post my review don't know why?
Awesome Quick Response smooth interface all in one store
Good interface
User interface is Good. Good service and Availability.
I don't know why but after you guys changed your user interface... Everything got messed up... You are not showing the price and product review when you open the product window.. I don't know why you guys changed that but just remove that Supercoin banner from product window... It covers the whole area where the price were written once... Plz do something of this
Good user friendly interface and good customer interaction..all in under one place
"Best interface!... just loved it ☺️ user friendly interface, no unwanted adds and fast delivery!"
Best shopping app... User-friendly Interface. Perfect on-time delivery...
Nice app. Simple and clean user interface

"appearance and user experience is awesome Smart app, product description and display is very clear and crisp with self explanatory images. assured and genuine product"
User friendly interface
Wonderful. Simply the best shopping app. Fabulous discount along with nice user interface and excellent delivery service makes it my first choice.
Excellent app. App is user friendly and has better interface than Amazon. Product delivery and customer service is also relatively better than Amazon.
Really good user interface!
"Delivery speed, app interface amazing. Actual product and the Pictures don't have much difference. Only two things I don't like about it. First that Customer care support is not impressive, writes out complaint and forget and the other that many a times, product price increases when we open its details."
"Now in contest with amazon.both in terms of delivery speed and pricing Everything,from user interface to flipkart pay later are getting better day by day. In most cases,you can get products at more discounted price using add 3 get 5%extra or add 4 get 10% extra discount. Shopping is fun here. No need to go anywhere. All products are original. U can trust blindly"
The app has changed its interface a way forward and no lags found and easy to browse and search for our needed one to buy and happy with the app!
Good interface with ease of shopping wide variety
Awesome products & user friendly interface ❤️
"Great app ,good user interface and customer friendly ecommerce site. Recently you had improved your delivery speed. 👍👍"
"Very customer friendly interface, online store and Service. Flipkart is Leader in India...,,👍"
"Nice Experience With Flipkart, If You Dislike The Products Which Delivered To Your Hand, Flipkart Will Take Back And Replace It With New Product Or Refund(4-6hours) Without Any Question. That's What I Like It, Also App Interface Is Also Amazing.. Overall Great, Useful Flipkart App. Thank You."
Excellent app user interface is too good every one should use it
"Pros: User experience is one of the best in the business, top marks for that. Checkout process is also smooth and very rarely fails. Recently ordered groceries as well via Suprmart feature within app which is really remarkable place to buy multiple items in one cart. Search, sort features are really intuitive. Cons: Supermart can't be found easily, it should be on landing page. Support management sometimes create unnecessary tickets for general queries."
Excellent interface
Flipkart service are good but interface may be need to improve now and more icon add now
Verry good interface
Awesome app interface and reasonable price.
"Nice app with nice deals and good User Interface... Filters also work properly, which makes shopping easier."
"Overall a good app with nice interface , can be improved in terms of packaging items and delivery"
All about this app is the user interface is very much good
User experience is good..
Easy to use..... interface is better than others....n I'm very poor in bargaining.....so generally I shop the stuffs online.....n I find filpkart is a good place for the purpose......n I'm such a book lover n I find best discount on the books at this platform.....so thankful to Flipkart.....❤️❤️❤️
"Dear Flipkart, I am dropping the rating from 3 to 1.. Worst ever customer service staff you had employed, who are not able to understand a simple concern. You had disabled your customer to directly call the helpline no. & when your dumb customer service reply the mails, without understanding the issue, directly close the issue. Being a Flipkart customer the treatment & user experience should be best, But sorry to say there is more harassment for being a plus customer."
excellent interface as usual and flawless experience
"Keeps saying - ""Transaction Declined on the basis of risk checks"" what a stupid user experience. Fix your false positives!!! Your are making loss for yourselves by not letting me buy stuff. It's happening for last 1 week, I could've purchase over 10k worth of items. Amazon is way better."
It is the only online shopping app with very awesome interface and facilities.I personally order all my stuff from only Flipkart. In my opinion It is the only trusted and legit shopping site 💯
Best Offers are available. Nice User experience always.
"Always a good experience.... Availability, interface to order and delivery are great.."
"You guys use big brand names during marketing to sell cheap crappy items. Nothing useful and quality is ever in stock but the marketing is done as if you're a one stop solution to all. I'm getting notifications for Puma, Adidas, etc but all that's in stock is unknown brands and their super low-rated stuff. Surprisingly, the prices are as high as top players. Please improve user experience and not just marketing strategies."
Clean interface
Userinterface 👍
"Nice interface, easy to use.. As a flipkart plus member the product has to deliver with 1 or 2 days.. It will take more than 1 week. Its very disappointed"
Worst user interface
Search options are better than any other apps multiple brands to choose from ranging from local to international the app interface is user friendly
Nice user interface. User experience can be improved by removing infinite scroll on home screen. Showing categorized products is more useful than mashing them on the same screen. Show the date of coming soon products. I was not easily able to discover the product's release date.
Superb Interface and filters
The app interface is the worst I feel that I am in a government website . Delivery is slow and even boxes are damaged Out of 5 App-3 Delivery-2 User friendly-2 Customer service-3
Very clean interface and awsome deals keep it up
Nice interface than Amazon. Better and more options than Amazon.
Fast delivery. Some rare products not available. Flipcart interface is awesome compared to Amazon for easy to access and look good.
Very nice user interface
"Comparatively better offers and pricing. Easy User Experience and Interface. All in one app with best delivery options. Easy customer care procedures also. 5 star the app serves what it is built for, instead of diverting into games, videos and such totally different sectors, which becomes a bit annoying"
User interface is Very friendly
Overall a gud user experience. Also I'm happy with the quality.
Good app and user interface very easy Super....
"Great Experiance on the user app interface, I like their services."
Great experience for shopping 😁 great deal 👌 amazing products easy interface all good
Wonderful service And convince App Interface
"User friendly interface,very nice"
Very friendly user experience ❤️
User experience is excellent 💯
Great user experience
The user interface is awesome
Worst support and interface. Instead of making shopping experience easy flipkart is downgrading the experience day by day. The new return policy in which everytime I have to share my ID proof to return a product is pathetic. Flipkart its a request do KYC of account one time rather than requesting ID proof everytime I return a product.
One of best user interface in have seen till date very easy to track
"Flipkart has started providinv pathetic service. I ordered a skybags luggage trolley and i received Aristocrat. What kind of nonsense it is? Now when trying to contact the customer care, your app user interface is not useful. Never going to order anything from here."
Good user interface
easy user interface

"Flipkart is amazing. I've been shopping for a long time. Easy interface, best offers, trusted suppliers and no hidden terms. Thank you flipkart for making our shopping easy. However, I'm bit disappointed with changing date from 10 to 5..."

"The best delivery experience along with an amazing app , the products orders so far have been working great no complaints. And best part about the app is the user friendly interface helps you to sort, filter and compare every product categorically by your preferences."
Flipkart has very good interface for buying product and they also provide huge product but butere customer support is not good because they didn't provide appropriate solution
Very easy interface & payment methods
"Overall great app, Good interface and noce offers, just a minor change i would like is while searching after entering text once let the text be cleared when searching again."

Very nice experience with very easy interface pretty good product in pretty good price
Easy interface for shopping and has lots of products in various categories to buy with desired price range
"Flipkart interface and other search features are good. I wanna suggest one improvement in search criteria. Please add one thing in search criteria that whether delivery fee applicable or not for low budget products. It would be helpful to place order with ease. As this filter is not available, we have to open each and every product to check the delivery fee. Please note this and help us. Thanks."
App user interface is very good. Easy to shop products in flipkart. Thanks to software developers
Great user experience
Great app.. User friendly interface..
Sometimes user interface goes terrible. Inspite of good Internet speed still keeps loading. Only appearance is good but interface is worst.
"Easy to use , fabulous app , great user interface problem exist while scrolling the list of wishlist press backbutton and it takes you to top of list"
Superb app interface & great visuals!

very friendly user interface and nice experience
Good user interface. Best offers ever.
variety of products are available. Amazing user interface. easy to use.
"Fast, convenient user interface"
User interface is better than Amazon
User friendly interface
"User interface is extremely good, but many times app hangs a lot"
Edit: I don't understand what happens when user is done shopping. That final landing page is so confusing now. When I click on back in left top then it takes me to payment page again. There is no visible clear button to continue. I think there should at least be one clear yellow.button saying continue shopping. Everytime I am done buying something I end up closing the app. Guys user experience can be improved here.
Good app with nice user interface
Great shopping app. Overall user experience is very nice. Great discounts and offers
awesome app with simple and easy understandable user interface.
"Nice app.. Flipkart provide what they tell.( I only used Flipkart assured, so this is my opinion. ) Waiting for big billion days. And debit card emi is a God send option for people like us in this Corona time. Interface is good. Five star from me.😎"
Best shopping app always got the right product from flipkart and the user interface is also very good.
Amazon gives far much better user experience. Neither fast delivery nor good user experience.Its better to stop wasting your time in flipkart
good collection of products and reasonable price. Excellent user interface
Love to shop online. Easy user interface of Flipkart App
You guys are in mainstream e-commerce line but your UI just gets worse and worse each time. I'm so disappointed with Flipkart. It was good till late 2018 but after that things went downhill and you guys didn't even try to step up your game. This is ridiculous. Please work on your app and provide better user experience and pay the developers to make UI smooth and decluttering instead of paying thousands of so-called influencers and celebrities.
Best E-comerce site simple and best interface
Great interface
The best platform for online shopping clean interface and easy access
Interface is much much better than Amazon. Search is also too good. You can become plus member just by shopping not like Amazon where you have to pay must for prime
I always get an error message when I search for something. And on top of that this is an unbelievably sluggish app and just gives a horrible user experience. No discounts are worth the horror you go through when you open the app!! I'm done with Flipkart.
User friendly....excellent user interface
"It is very good app for e-purchasing. Also, the user interface is very helpful."
It is very handy and good application..Awesome experience...lot has improved in user experience...great offers too by flipkart
I like app performance and user friendly interface
Flipkart user's interface is always better than any e commerce
"Considering corona's situation in India, majority of the people are working from their homes. So, it's a humble feedback to Flipkart that in order to make some money not only from big cities but towns too, please update your app as well as logistics model. Your sellers don't deliver even at 2nd tier cities or maybe it's an app glitch that it always says SELLER can't deliver to this PIN CODE whereas Amazon, Nykaa, Myntra can. Marketing will never work until User Experience is smooth."
Affordable prices and easy to use interface
You can find product according to your pocket from low to high👍👍 and variety also...but u should improve on ur interface
Better deals than ever earlier on Flipkart....even better than Amazon..still few glitches..need to improve app interface...
Flipkart is a Bangalore based E-commerce site.. the Best in User Interface than Amazon.
Very clean and professional interface 👍 Nice
Interface is not good try to improve it
"Great deals, offers. Keep it up. Wonderful user experience."
"Cool UI, easy to use interface, amazing offers and pretty simple return policy! Love flipkart!"
Handy interface
User friendly interface.

Good user experience!
Awesome app!! Cool interface
"Good offers, prompt delivery and very user friendly user interface"
I have bought realme c15 for Rs 7600/-. Which is much cheaper than amazon. Very simple and fast payment....interface. Thank you Flipkart...
User interface is far better than Amazon.
Nice interface of app and easy buying options....
Its interface isn't as advanced as amazon. You can't even save more than 25 products in the cart. And sometimes the packaging isn't that good. But the prices are cheap and delivery is fast. So 4 stars for that.
Very user friendly interface
Nice user interface
Best Ecommerce site in india. I prefer Flipkart over Amazon. Flipkart has nice and clean user interface. Limited but good product's. Flipkart plus is great service. Supercoins is greatest way to purchase thing's.
Good user experience
this app has wonderful userfriendly interface i love it.
I love the interface & services that are provided by Flipkart But The Refund Process Is Horrible If ordered by any debit card rest of everything is superclass
User interface of Flipkart is far better than Amazon. That's the only reason i like it.
Great app the interface is so Frank.
I am very happy with the user experience app is very fast a easy to access and also very cool offers Tq flipkart
"Pros. of using FK is Plus membership and good application interface. Complaint resolution services are poor. If you want to cancel 1 product from your order, it will cancel others but not the desired one! While, Amazon offers are too good and very much regular/frequent."
Could be better! User Interface needs improvement.. Now seems better..
Excellent user interface
Superb user interface .
Good interface and their service is best and the products has quality

"Big billion days or fake. flipkart cheating public (Customers) fraudulently offer. Fake price on interface. Fake price. Fraudulently Ecommerce website on flipkart.(0)Zero star Owner: Walmart (81.3%), Tiger Management (4.70%), Microsoft (1.3%), Accel (1.1%), Founder(s): Sachin Bansal; Binny Bansal Filpkart Cheating and fraud public"
Easy to purchase and returns. Need to improve little bit on customer interface
"The thing that makes flipkart better than amazon is ""Optimized Product search"" whenever we search for any product ...the Optimized search shows us perfect results at the top. That thing is missing in amazon ...Its User Interface is hard... Sometimes it becomes difficult to get perfect and best list associated to our search."
Nice interface of the app
The interface is very nice . All the items come under one roof . Price and quality of products is nice .
"very user friendly interface. easy to view products,specifications are clearly written ... and yes,huge number of available products is its core advantage over others."
I really like user interface of Flipkart app
User friendly interface and easy to find the products.😊🙂

Nice user interface I like the filter option 👌😁😁
"Need to improve a lot on there server to reduce lagging on search and other surf's, otherwise a good clear interface for an awesome purchase experience of items, to clearly see the descriptions of the items."
"One of the best user interface. I did get a lot of good deals on Flipkart, sometimes the concern is about the authenticity of the product."
I love it because of its user-friendly interface.Unlike other shopping platforms and the stuff is relatively cheaper in price !!!
I like the interface most .. easy to find anything from wide range of authentic products. I never get the chance to return anything. whatever i order i get the real one.
Good interface
Interface is very good but Flipkart need to work on their sellers.... Sometimes there are false information...otherwise everything is perfect ❤️
User interface is good. Just try and improve on filter content.
"Use interface is good compare to rival company Amazon, wherein it's difficult to sort the things and most of time is is frustrating but on Flipkart it always a pleasant experience."
Great app with best user experience
Amazing Experience. Its interface is so convinient to use.
Easy to handle and great interface
I feel very happy to browsing ur app...really very good interface 👍👍
Certain sellers are really good..some are really bad. Delivery is slightly slow but manageable. Return policy is really good better than others in this regard. Interface and filters are the best. Overall best shopping experience online.
Flipkart in terms of interface and graphics is way better than Amazon..
best user interface Easy to use And good deals....👍 loved flipkart pay later... feature.👌 But most of the time product is out of stock in my area pincode👎.
Why Bengali language is not included in flipkart interface?
Amazing Deals... Easy Interface
Very good. Love the browsing interface. Much better than Amazon. Delivery is fast. Installation of products also happens fast!
"Indian Company, Genuine discounts and user interface better than Amazon"
Best interface out of all shopping app 😍love it.
Nice interface
Best shopping app with easy interface
Good user interface
Safer and good user experience
I loved it user interface and delivery timing
"I am a regular Amazon shopper and it is after a long time that I used Flipkart. The interface has improved a lot and I was happy to see Flipkart doing well there. But when it comes to overall experience it sucked and I am not going to recommend Flipkart or use it again. First they gave Rs 1000 extra on One plus 7 for exchange. So as a customer I went with Flipkart instead of Amazon for this model. It was clearly mentioned that the product just needs to work, have no CRACKS on screen and DENTS on the body. All these were true with the phone I exchanged. Finally when the guy came to pick up, first he will make you wait for half an hour since he has a long process to finish while taking return. Second he is incentivised to cut the value of the phone. Even when Flipkart never mentioned about scratches on body, it was a test the person doing return need to sign off on and he won't take the phone till there are no scratches. Finally he charged me extra Rs 3750 or value reduction for these scratches which Flipkart doesn't make clear of. Flipkart, your experience sucks and I am not going to come anywhere close again which your wrong commitments."
Better than any other app. Has a great interface. Also provides a wide range of brands
"All the promotions are good,interface is awesome,but worst responsibility while during delivery,costumer care is really ignored"
Flipkart..has this.. better ever interface among..all .. service is good..time to time update..& delivery services are Good..it provides notification abt shipping ..details to track your product..easier..
Interface is user friendly and offers are pocket saving
I had a very nice shopping experience.. The cool things which i like in flipkart are the supercoins and it had user friendly interface... I love shopping from flipkart.. 💝
"Filled with absolutely unprofessional employees. They are a total disaster when it comes to user experience. I was delivered a defective fossil smart watch, raised a replacement request and they are continuing to delay their response. It has been hilariously ridiculous talking to them only for them to disconnect my call midway."
"Wow super app, user interface is better than Amazon, nice offers also. Just loved it"
I have been using this app for a really long time and my experience has been really good . I have got quite the loyalty benefits I deserved according to my spending. Overally this app is great. Much better user interface when you compare it with its rival Amazon.
They have actually worked on the interface of the application..I have been using it for years but I can see the transformation..it has improved..I would enjoy more if the interface becomes more customer friendly
Very attractive user interface also very good order details with fast delivery
Very good interface I am really impressive
Very good interface for shopping Way better than Amazon Can find things easier than Amazon Offers also good But plus membership don't have powers like Amazon prime Overall good
Good website with excellent user interface
"Great interface ,easy to buy"
Very nice user interface and then very easy to compare and view the product s.....
"I loved this app, I am a Flipkart plus member and delivery free for me. Excellent application interface, easy to search n sorting, mostly product on Flipkart at low price compared to other"
User interface is something better than Amazon and other sites.
It's a great shopping application I just love the way they showcase everything to their customers. Great user interface highly usable.

"Friendly user experience, in time delivery"
best online shopping portal..... no online shopping company can compare flipkart.. not even Amazon. interface of app is good and very convenient. great facilities to the customers. hassle free returns.
Good user experience. Little bit disappointed with delivery.
Best n more friendly user interface than amazon.
It's good and has a good interface.
Any product open thats not open something went wrong in interface mobile
Lakho rupay ki shopping kari maine. Aur uske baad bhi itna bura user experience. Big billion days me maine ache discount pe order kiye. Aur mere order bina notification ke cancel kr diye. Maine complaint ki to bolte hain dobara order place karo. Are chutiyo dobara order pe discount doge kya. Bhaiyo amazon se shopping karo. Unke offer bhale hi itne ache na ho. Par aise bikhari nhi hain wo.
"Edit: I ordered some products but the delivery date is some 10 days after or 15 days. Delivery should be fast Deals are good here no doubt, But the main thing is the app interface which I liked very much easy filters and search options than Amazon. Well done Team Flipkart. We are Proud to have a Indian E-Commerce website like you. 👍"
Best gui ever.awesome experience. The user interface is super easy to scroll and filter
Improve user experience
"This is better than Amazon in these sections 👉 (App interface, App maintenance, Fast Delivery, availability of stocks & offers.)"
"Worst experience...bad interface,for every product it shows not deliverable.sometimes very late order packing and shipping makes it uncomfortable."
User Experience improved a lot. Especially refund is processed within seconds which I loved ❤️❤️❤️
"Mostly i buy through AMAZON but this time their user interface was too tough to get the right deal. I tried flipkart after long time and easily found some deals of choice. Still u need to improvise your offers. Manybitems are offered very less dicounts for eg say........ Pressure cooker,Cricket bats,etc. You r focusing only on high end gadgets. Which i did not need asnon this time."
The user experience is not good nor the delivery agent is picking the phone or any flipkart representative is picking the phone the order is already at least response to my problem bt no one os there. I willnot purchase from Flipkart from next time
very user-friendly interface
"Very easy and smooth interface, though need more improvement in the app but still it deserves 5 stars"
User interface is very reach and friendly....i love while surfing for choiced products....Feel if Indianess is real
Worthless app as compare to Amazon Flipkart delivery time approx 10 days and Amazon gives us to delivery within 3 day Flipkart is worthless and interface is very confusing its not a friendly very complicated please don't download this app we have batter option Amazon.in its a bestest app for shopping and Flipkart's coustomer care are not responsive and very poor communication skill like unprofessional zeroooo app Play Store please remove this app
Good app.nice user interface
"Flipkart is improving day by day , Earlier I used to shop on amazon , but the service from Flipkart and offers and app interface has improved a lot...thanks for great bbd sale experience"
"Earlier I was not satisfied with this online shop...but today Flipkart has improved a lot in its application user interface as well as collections of products, delivery and all the other services. My only concern with Flipkart is that some delivery agent declines to deliver the product when the pincode is actually deliverable...please concentrate on that and educate your agents for home delivery, that's what a home delivery means. Its not that asking the customer to come somewhere and collect."
"Best App for online shopping, the most thing i like is the user interface....the best in all"
Just like better user interface
I will suggest this app is the best shopping app and the interface is very excellent when compared from Amazon.
Interface is very good
Good interface and products are delivered before the estimated time loved it
Good app with user friendly and good user interface ..fast delivery some of the products..
The interface of application is very good. Flipkart shows every product image in very attractive manner.
The user experience is really good
"Wonderful aap, at time of shopping filpkart has h osm experience also it has very user friendly interface I loved filpkart 😘😍😘"
This app is very stable and interface is very user-friendly.
"Worst user experience, user have to struggle to order his product. Better to buy products from Amazon"
Interface user to be improved while shopping from supermart
Nice app. Great discount but the interface is not up to the mark..
Pathetic customer service. I have faced one user interface bug/issue in my phone . There was worst customer service from flipkart and irriatated me alot by disgusting techinical expert support.Always they are telling that the they could not reach the customer.Finally one point i want to mention that worst process to reach out the customer service.
There is a good thing that can be modified that is the user interface of the app . It's far good in Amazon but we believe flipkart will make it more better.
Interface much better than Amazon.
The user interface and all is very good appreciated But the delivery time of your products is very high You don't deliver on time
Webpage interface is way better than Amazon. Smooth shopping experience with fast & quality packaged delivery. Thanks to their Good Logistics supply chain......
The best user interface
Very Good And Awesome Interface and Marketing Experience Just In Our Area The Deliveries are not in time We have to wait whole day then they came at night 😑 Otherwise Everything is Okay
Professional Simple user interface.Thanks to flipkart
Good interface
Great for shopping and the user interface is nice
"Pathetic experience, brought a refrigerator during October 2020 sales, got a damaged product. They said ba technician has to visit and it's taking forever. The app interface is not user friendly,you can't talk to someone who is in authority. They have predetermined corporate call people who mumbles the same words taught to them. There is no space in the app to rise a proper complaint and connect with the authorities... If you have a damaged product to return you are doomed."
Great UI experience for text as well as assets(better than amazon). Easy and simplified navigation and user experience. Only problem is with ekart ie. their logistics which takes lil extra time to deliver. Apart from that amazing app
Good interface
Good interface
Amazon se accha hai aur indian company should refer it before going to amazon and its interface is also good than amazon
The best app in the world 😊😊😊😊😊 It is the best online shopping app I have ever seen and wolud recommend real things with easy returns and every type of delivery accepted and interface is also user friendly not like Amazon the graphics are good very good shopping worth it I have order 80+ orders on Flipkart I am sharing this app also to improve it very good experience So my experience is good to Flipkart I want to give this app -------> 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟stars
Best user interface .
"Awesome. Even two years back app needed some improvement. Resumed shopping from Flipkart due to more quality products, better offers, discounts & variety is more than before. User interface also changed. Now ""coin"" option is also available. Ita up to date with all feautures. Thumbs up."
"Since 2014 I am using flipkart, I purchased many and many products with good quality and good discounts. and the User interface face is too good and the app is very user friendly. I love flipkart and the deals which they are providing 😍❤️."
Very user friendly interface and great offers too. Payment interface is awesome.
For now i haven't faced any issue regarding any product that i have biyed from flipkart So i consider this app is reliable hope it doesn't betray my expectations and also the user experience in this app is good you must checkout some good deals which is provided by the app....But some of the products are not available in the store pls provide us some variety of options
Always better interface while using the Flipkart app
"I find Flipkart the best platform among all,, reason being best user interface and it works fine in slow network conditions unlike Amazon."
Good user interface . Quite happy with the app and offers.
A Great app. CARES ABOUT its customers. The interface is much smoother and easier and thus the best ecommerce app in my view. You get deals worth every penny.Above that you too get Supercoins on every purchase. And you get the Plus Membership for almost Free. Thus Flipkart Rocks. Thanks.
Interface is awsome
I 💝 flipkart because the discounts are awesome and especially I 💝 the order details interface 😍😍
Interface is good but delivery service is poor my product is already 1 week delayed and whenever i call them they said sir you will get your product from this date but in reality its had been 12 days i ordered my product but I didn't receive delivery of my product 😡😡😡😡
"The free delivery option in cart says buy x amount of product and delivery will be free. But when 3-4 items are in cart, it never happens. Similarly if add and remove any item in short span of time, the price fluctuates. One painting cost increased from 200 to 950 in a matter of seconds. Other than this type of problem in cart, the user experience is nice and smooth."
"I am changing from 4 stars to 5 stars, primarily because the user interface experience in the app has increased quite significantly."
Being a regular user of your app i would like to point out few things 1 ) The interface your app is really good 2) The delivery speed is not good as few things take more than 2 weeks to get delivered which is really not appreciable and also on average it takes around 4-5 days to deliver a product which certainly is not impressive since i am a flipkart PLUS user which promises a faster delivery . Therefore please look into it This is the only problem that i face
Lovely app with kind interface
Simpler interface and great pricing
Nice user experience. App is upto expectation.very user friendly
Shopping easily and user interface is looks good compare than amazon.
Flipkart has outdone Amazon. It's more user interface is way better. Add a more myriad collection @ more affordable prices!
The best thing is you keep improving the user experience day by day..
Awesome....Good deals at reasonable price. It's the best online shopping site with good quality at attractive prices.. The User interface and product information is also much better than amazon. Please keep prices low as possible on products as we are getting cheap products on amazon and snapdeal and paytm mall.
Best user experience with flipkart mobile app
Has improved a lot from what it was a year or 2 back. After purchase it sometimes gets confusing how to go back to home and pressing back leads to the same pages of payment and cart. U need to fix this as it causes bad user experience.
"App interface is hangig, while placing order. Except that shopping experience is good."
Better user interface easy to order or replace good quality better than Amazon
User interface is very easy and smooth
"Amazing Interface, always go to place"

"I like the user interface for this app..!! I didn't find any other online shopping app this comfortable. But delivery is too late, Tough, I am plus member. I ordered an item on Amazon 3 days after I order on Flipkart, Amazon delivered the product today and still Flipkart didn't deliver the product."
The interface is way better than amazon
Utter slow when loading the front screen and the pictures of the products. Amazon is far better than this app when compared to user experience.
"Like the products, also the app interface is very good it is user friendly and the products are really good and of very good quality also the service personnel of the Flipkart are very much understanding and helpful they solve our queries and co-operate with customers"
Better user experience than amazon. It gives you supercoin feature but one thing i don't like about flipkart is there are always some frauds happening.
User friendly interface

Nice app.. Easy interface... Good offers.. Nice customer support.. Keep it up
Very good user friendly interface
The app doesn't let me get past the Select Language page. What if I don't want to see any regional laguange? I want to view the app in English itself. The language page pops up when I open the app does not have a skip button. This is what poor user experience looks like.
Very good user interface for search product.

"THIS IS THE WORST AND DUMBEST APP I HAVE EVER USED .!! All I wanted was to reset the password to login, but it has been making me running pillar to pillar. First I was asked for the number.. Entered number and opted to use OTP for login.. But damn its asking for the password again.. God!! Are your developers high on something while designing the login interface?"
"Good deals,user friendly interface,grt consumer satisfaction"
Good app interface and prompt customer service. on par with amazon these days.
Very good interface... Easy to use
best app for online purchase. Refund is quick in case of cancel. Flipkart coins can be used for multiple subscriptions. User interface is quick and easy. Delivery is on time and well packed items. Delivery fee is higher than amazon but cleaner interface and delivery than amazon. Well-done Walmart 👌🏾
User experience has improved considerably as has customer service of Flipkart. But the the layout could still be improved especially on the product landing page. It still seems too cluttered
Good operating interface and competitive price as per other shopping site. But sometimes price was less before opening product details and after opening product details price was increased.
Good user interface along with good process speed compare to some other shopping apps thanks flipkart for amazing service nd delivery in rural areas
Just better than other apps in shopping items are genuine . App interface is good i like it.
"This app is great but you should improve your app's animation and user interface . Otherwise, EXCELLENT till now , I looked out many online shops for a product but got it for lowest price here."
Freindly good user interface.
UI is awesome Best part is the user interface... From searching to checkout... Everything is smooth... Worst part is they wont take faulty phone.
The user experience and interfaces are nice. Buy the product is not quality.
"The interface is very slow. Please fix it, as we are unable to use pay later section. The pay less option does not show up and it is interfering to pay the amount as tge due day is showing up. As a whole the whole website interface is slow too."
Flipkart app has been upgraded. User experience has improved.
"Nice intuitive interface, but lately facing issues with setting notification for back in stock items, it always shows error that ""Please try again after sometime"""
Excellent purchasing experience.. Grate User interface and Product category. Lot's of product. Faster delivery. Big Thanks to Flipkart And App Developer.😃
The interface of the app is much much better than Amazon. That is the reason I order only from Flipkart.
"1. Very easy user interface (Amazon are you listening) 2. The product categories are perfect. 3. Search names and items listed match 4. Lot of search items for purchase 5. Good prices - usually less 6. Trust worthy 7. On time/in time delivery 8. What else do you want? Amazon? No, you can't buy Amazon on Flipkart. But the app repeatedly asks for feedback and I don't like giving feedback. Hence 1*down"
"Great user interface,besapp"
Very good user experience
User-friendly interface
User-friendly interface 👍
Products are cheaper than other sites but the application interface and the filtering process should be more better.

"User experience and delivery process much improved mainly Flipkart quick, I m getting very good benifit out of it. The quality of vegetables is very nice."
"Great app for shopping. Although the app's user interface could be better. I sometimes feel some of the listed products and sellers are of substandard quality, there have been few glitches while making payments and when it comes solving any issue you guys need to improve."
"Better user interface , less data consumption but I noticed that for some products there is a huge difference in price compared to amazon like S10 plus it is almost double which is a bit disappointing"
Best app for online shopping...great exeperince... User friendly interface with smooth policies...thanks so much

Amzing and awesome graphical user interface
a good platform to buy products online. I like the user interface its very user friendly.
"Easy interface, easy to use, great products and services"
really liked the user interface. i found it easier than amazon in every way
I have no issues with the app interface and functionality but few third party sellers on the platform sell duplicate and cheap products which is very disappointing and that holds back the customers from buying products through Flipkart. So I suggest Flipkart to give permission to those sellers who are verified and well mannered when coming to their services and behaviour !!
good app interface and easy to navigate
"Undoubtedly it deserves five star for its pay latter feature, pocket friendly interface & genuine delivery"
Better user interface than Amazon Happy that the filters for searching for products is very good.
"70% of the orders are not deliverable to my location (Rampachodavaram) Amazon is far better in this... but the app interface is more simple, easy compared to Amazon.."
"1. User interface is too overwhelming. 2. Lots of unnecessary stuff. Is it ecommerce store or online casino/game parlour or online video platform? 3. Most items cannot be delivered at my location where all amazon, bludart etc delivers the product. Overall app developer's false attempt to keep people on this app it is stuffed with too many unnecessary things."
Good User Experience
"Very useful app...great user experience,nice work."
"The best shopping app in India so far as per my consideration. Truely amazing. The smooth interface, fast service, great customer service, best Prices, great quality all you can get here. Till date no objection. Very very happy customer."

"I have got a used product and on return order, pickup boy denied to pick up as he was not able to understand their app interface. He was confused how to process this return order. I have very clearly mentioned that i have got a used product and the product is very dirty and has stain on it."
Easy interface for all generation. All type of things have number of variants.
I like the User Interface Of flipkart.Easy to use and so comfortable

User interface can be better
Very bad interface
Awesome app for shopping..Good user interface..!!
The app and interface is pretty fast. Connects seemleslly with cashback sites without any fuss. Their AI tracks your interests to bring connected items over other items. The best part is I have never faced any glitches in payments or gift card payments.
Good user interface
Can you add Home option in the top. We need to press back button multiple times. Make userfriendly interface
good interface
Way Pathetic service compared to Amazon in terms of customer support. User interface is also disgusting. Their call back option is the worst of all. I haven't got a called back till date. And also the customer executive are unprofessional in way of talking.
good online shopping app..but quality check of Flipkart assured products must be enhanced to next level..sometimes duplicate stuff are being delivered.othewise user interface is good.
simple interface

Super Shopping App. Which has good interface other than any any shopping app.
Flipkart is one of the best App I use. User friendly and interactive interface. Good order tracking system with fast delivery product. Last I would like to thanks delivery boys.
Good offers n nice interface
"The interface is good that makes this easy to use. But when I ordered a pack of two tshirts they send me of two different sizes. And the best thing is COD , other apps like Amazon doesn't give option for COD payment."
Great app Nice interface Easy to find anything
Good service and i liked app interface
Nice interface. Love the flipkart assurance. However collections are less in home decor range.

"Thanks flipkart for valuable service, response. Easy to use interface also customer service is very good"
unfriendly user interface
Awesome interfaces
Used to be really good but the interface now is just a little too slow...laggy...and choppy...prices are still amazing tho🤑
user experience to select products and naming needs to be improved
user interface is good
awesome interface and best discounts supercoin feature is awesome
Bad user experience. Invoice takes a long time to show in the app after the item is delivered. The app is 4+ stars in google play. Maybe paid up reviews
"Good, but Flipkart need to do a lot more on packaging and handling of products. To be honest the user interface of Flipkart is way way better than Amazon. The graphics of Flipkart are unmatched even for Amazon, thats how good the UI of Flipkart whare an $850 billion USD company ceases to match a $30 billion USD startup. But, Flipkart you need to choose good suppliers for cheap products like bags, books and cheap cloths. Keep, pushing your boundaries."
User friendly interface 🥰
User experience is great!! Also Many offers are always available.. give it a try.....
"Initially we used to prefer Amazon over Flipkart due to few reasons like delivery speed,wide range of products etc.But now Flipkart has improved a lot in terms of customer friendly interface,fast delivery,collection of various brands and products,low prices compared to other ecom businesses.Appreciate the great Job Flipkart 👍🏻"
Best User experience !
Good Application and using Interface is Very easy
"If u talk about interface, customer service, product availability, product quality etc are on top notch..bt two things that I don't like- one Flipkart takes longer than usual delivery time which I hate the most bt u can do much more with the supercoin which ultimately gives u satisfaction."
"Superb User interface , Premium Products , Quality Packing And good after service"
I just loved the User Interface.
Fast delivery easy interface on site.
good experience with flipkart it's interface is sooo good to understand everyone
fast and good user experience.
nice ....interface...easy to search any products...love it..🇨🇮JAI HIND🇨🇮
"App is good but Customer care contact option needs to improve in the user interface, it was very complecated to find."
"The best shopping app, user interface is far better than Amazon."
good user interface
Very friendly interface... Shopping is butter... Giod price and quality depends on brand. Overall great to shop on this
You know what I like about Flipkart the user interface No online shopping platforms provide the best UI like Flipkart hats off to their work But there are things to improve the grocery items are limited including the detergents especially because Amazon provides wide variety of groceries including detergents
"Facing issues with uploading ID proof details on contact us option in the app. the interface does not give any acknowledgement regarding successful upload or rejection of uploading of documents during return or refund through contact us portal in Flipkart app, perhaps Flipkart is not so customer friendly anymore"
good user interface
very poor interface
Awesome user interface 😍
Good interface. Secure booking. Safe delivery. Little late but ok. Packaging is also good. Payment options are good. One of the very few trustworthy shopping platforms.
Amazing customer service and interface
Happy with the interface of flipkart.
good user interface
i like the app interface
Very user friendly interface. You guys have COD for the Pixel 4a. That's amazing. Debit card EMI is another good feature 👍 although I'm not eligible for it. 😔
"Flipkart has user friendly interface and easy to use, I'm fully satisfied with this app."
Good user experience compared to other sites. Price is also less for almost every product compared to Amazon or other websites. Nice app.
Nice service. The app and website interface both look fantastic and easy to use.Kudos to the flipkart team.
Best user interface i have ever seen
Can't add GSTIN to my account. Amazon has cleaner interface and business account portal
100% satisfied with app interface and servicing
Great interface experience 😀😀
Best online shopping experience...... Nice user interface
best user interface to shopping
Product is safe delivered then I like user interface
Had Geat experience always with Super interface and systematic display of items
Best part is the User Interface which is user friendly. Best app compared to other applications.
Best broswsing interface
A very complicated interface to operate. A fraudulent system of delivery and an equally abysmal resolution of customer problems.Ekart delivery guys cancel orders on their own and flipkart has no clue. It's a system devised for harassment wherein a customer is caught in a loop of endless calls and mails and problem never gets resolved.
great app...thx Flipkart.... great interface ...
"Reasonable rates , nice delivery and excellent user interface of the app makes flipkart the best shopping app in India."
Easy user experience makes shopping fun and also addicted. Prices seems less compared to other shopping websites. You can select product based on ratings of users which can never go WRONG. I LOVE IT✌️
Very good interface for purchasing
Awesome User Interface we like Flipkart due to there great presentation of product and offers
The app has a good interface and great collection super coins system is also exiting services and deliveries are also great totally amazing
Best app for shopping clear and simple interface than amazon
Great e-commerce company. Service is excellent and as a developer one thing added is user interface is excellent than any e-commerce app.
"It gives good deals during big billion days, so you should move your product to cart and buy it during sale. Also, Flipkart's interface is so good that you can pass your time by just scrolling."
Now it has become very easy to shop on flipkart as it has got varieties to shop from. Also loved the new interface that is user friendly. The supercoins and the games are very interactive and addictive too.So its been a great experience to shop on flipkart now compared to earlier..😊
An excellent shopping experience With varieties nd varieties of products With a sutable nd affordable price Nd its a good user experience
Nice Shopping app 1.Nice user interface 2.Easy to use 3.genuien product 4.fast delivery 5.give product as description
Best & easy user interface.
Excellent app excellent interface 🥳👏👏
"The user interface of this app is much much better than Amazon, also the price is lesser than Amazon."
You are good . Better than amazon on user friendly interface. Amazon is bunch of unrated product but you provide all queries answers and have wider courier service. So you are better than amazon in India. Ican give you 4.5+ .
Best shoping app especially for India. Most beautiful user interface. Loved it.
Excellent application. Very smooth interface.
First open interface Nice & best shopping app💚💜💞💓😊👍
"User interface is superb, ease to find required items."
Nice app very good interface and all product
User experience is not much intuitive. The suggestions need to be made more dynamic. Keep showing same results for months. Too much information is on screen. Need it to be little clean with clearly set out the shopping part with other options available
User Interface is good but customer service is very very worst . Products are not Good As I have to return every products which I have ordered and only in second time I get the satisfaction product...
The User interface of app is awesome. It provides great offers for buying. Delivery is very good.
Nice User interface
I find the interface quite impressive.
Good interface
"It has improved alot , good user experience"
"Poor post sale service, delivered incomplete product and now delaying retut or in competing order, poor chat interaction interface, where you have to wait a long to get any response, that is even non fruitfil, The same thing happening again and poor customer interface"
User interface is better than Amazon
First of all it was made in india app.... second such a good user interface ..... And I can say probably best app to buy electronics....I myself order every electronic from Flipkart....
Well Good Application Made in India too The interface and category wise distribution of products and it's simple to find any product available on it(flipkart).
The User Interface of Flipkart is way better than Amazon. 👍 for that!
Lovely user interface and order delivered fast.
"Imagine one day you got message from flipkart, that you can order anything but (just one) for free, what would u? #loveflipkart #awesomeinterface"
"Flipkart is a fastest growing App for online shoping. User friendly interface, easy to access . Its provide lots of offer during festivals and every months with fastest delivery. I had best experience of it. Fully customer satisfaction. Thanks Flipkart"
Good App User Experience is very good
Amazing user interface...Always surprise me with great deals
Upload country of origin of the products ..... for increasing user experience
I love user experience
This is one of the best Platform for Online shopping .......user friendly interface.....easy to use
Half good ( for interface & shopping xperience) & half bad (headache of getting exchange prblms ....! & Refund issues - fraud )
"#Return policy - ☠️☠️☠️☠️(never ever keep hopes ). If you got any wrong or damaged product ,just put on fire and just grill sweet potato on them. #Interface - delivered sms will be send to your grand child #customer care - High on weed ,just casuly sitting and busy in their own things , become active at the time of asking ratings for themselves. #Delivery - below average (my bsnl net is faster then them. # price - asking like we are ambani.you can buy 2 for same price from amazon and ebay."
This Shopping App has Never let me Down Its aweSome Just the App's User interface can get better OVERALL ITS REALLY GOOD!
"Very handy and easy interface, excellent customer support."
Excellent user interface. Much better than Amazon 👍
"I have recently thought of buying a ROG Strix g15 Laptop from Flipkart, i thought of buying a Laptop around ₹80,000. When reading description and features about the laptop i found weird glitch that is been found predominantly when scrolling down and up and unable to read the specs, So now I'm thinking to drop my buying thought since i thought my phone display was the problem but when i checked with other three mobiles on same page i found the same issue.,Unhappy with user experience."
Its offers are amazing and user experience is good and simple but you cant rotate it
Good interface
"Good app for online shopping, nice user interface"
Nice interface
I like interface of flipkart than amazon
Best shopping app till now..i dont like amazon..flipcart is having very user friendly interface
"Flipkart is a fraud I had ordered a side table recently. There was an installation date given by Flipkart, but after delivery the commitment changed and I was told to do the installation myself. This cannot be sellers fault, it is Flipkart's fault because there was a clear pop up on the order kart while purchasing the table to schedule an installation date and time. Just after delivery, the interface changes and says it is a DIY installation"
If I Had To Say One Thing About This App Then I Will Say User Interface....
"Very bad user interface , sometime it works and sometimes not... Supercoin page doesnt open.."
"Some improvement is required in the flight booking interface. Post confirmation of all relevant details and before moving on to the payment option the summary of itenary must be visible for the ease of reconfirmation and to correct any anomalies say time, date etc. Even it would be better to reflect the same as a summary on the page of payment if possible or as a separate summary sheet or review the booking once more before moving on to the payment page. It would make user experience seamless."
Best user friendly interface
Xlent interface
"Nowadays, while click on any products the entire interface become blank. Only can see a white canvas."
Interface of this app is way better than amazon.. but delivery is way slower tha amazon
Please solve the glitch of when I open any searched product it will be invisible to my interface please solve the glitch
Excellent.. User Interface.
"very good app, user friendly user interface."
nice app interface
User interface is very nice
The worst user experience and delivery service ever.
"Poorly designed app, very cluttered interface, search is pathetic and now even checkout process is worst, smartphone device info view flickers and then goes blank. Tried purchasing Motorola TV, on trying to make payment, payment view goes blank..."
"Good user interface, smooth shopping experience. Look for ""flipkart assured"" deals"
"Best shopping experience over amazon,amazon app interface like an going in hospital.But, flipkart is very charming and offers Delightfull experience"
"My Flipkart experience has ways been great.. The interface is so user friendly and is do easy to use. The service is great, and returns are also hassle free. Flipkart is always my go to app.."

User friendly interface Easy to shop
Good application and user interface is really good
Great variety of products. They are good quality. The delivery could be faster and the user interface could also look better. Haven't shopped for clothing here as yet. But other items seem good.
All in one app.. Nice user interface to access the contents...
Ultimate user experience
Excellent User Interface easily navigata to various sections of the app Very responsive and delivery information experience is also great!!
"User Interface is very bad whenever I search a product , scroll , open a product and press back it takes me to the start of the list which is very annoying."
Nice user experience
"Nice experience,keep it up..interface and search engine is good."
User friendly interface 🙏
The using interface are awosame ... It's really fantastic....
Nice app good user experience but all offline products are not avelaible
User friendly interface
Great interface
Nice and better than Amazon. Interface is user friendly and cool. The system of super coins is also pretty good. Low rate of product scams etc. Their is a chance of Only 10-12% of getting product defective. Over all nice app for all and all types of products are Available.
"The shopping experience is great. But sometimes the product price drops after my purchase and return period which makes me sad. It'll be great if you have a policy like ""if price drops within one year of my purchase , I can claim the discount"" like amazon. Except this I love the Flipkart's interface. My laptop, Washing machine , AC , Books are all ordered through flipkart. Thank you flipkart."
Easy & balanced interface
Superb interface.
Good using interface compare to Amazon
"Flipkart is trusted the most and Amazon gives better experience, says Survey. The e-commerce homegrown Indian player Flipkart has trusted Indian brands, but Amazon's user experience is better. Thus, both companies are trusted brands in India"
Great experience. Easy to work with. Smooth Interface.
Best interface easy to use Good service fast delivery 👌
User experience is very disappointed for me please improve your app user quality and icons of under app
"If you have a situation that's slightly (even marginally) beyond their SOP, the whole Flipkart system comes down crumbling. Classic cookie-cutter syndrome. Their customer care reps are totally hopeless and so is the system interface. I wonder what made Walmart pay USD16B to acquire them."
Overall good interface
Much Better than Amazon in Terms of User interface and Delivery
"Best place for online purchasing. Interface is simple, which is good! And easy to use."
Best app for online shopping. It has best interface and search results. Best customer service.
Very Good Interface
"Wow, a great app compared to all other online shopping apps! Nice features, wonderful interface, lightning deals, fast delivery, great discounts,..... what not to say!!! Really liked the app very much."
The user interface and product line is good in Flipkart but I'm giving only one star because of their worst delivery service and because Flipkart delivery boy centric instead of customer centric I had waste so much time because of their delivery service and delivery boys I will never order from Flipkart in future
Mast experience hai. Interface bbi amazon se achcha hai
"First impressive thing is that it have a very good user friendly interface, and options also good."
Great offers and excellent users interface..
Great app interface
Flipkart is one of the Best online shopping interface in India. Every product is good qulity on flipkart. Reasonable prices on products one more thing is good customer support I happy with flipkart online products and also in time delivery.
Great easy to use amazing interface😍
Good interface ....
Whenever we are browsing a page and when we hit back it will take us to the top of the page instead of just sending us back to the most recent one. The worst user experience.
The most cheap quality service of everything. The only thing about the app which is good is its interface. Rest everything from delivery to quality of customer satisfaction is very poor. The delivery gets on delayeing and at the end u need to call the support staff which rarely give some support.
Flipkart should learn from other shopping sites like amazon how to design their user interface and keep it smooth for their customer. Flipkart doesn't values the feedback of the customers.I request amazon's technical team to help flipkart in upgrading his application for better customer service
User experience is getting worst day by day.the layout is a mess.finding a product difficult than ever
Awesome interface and easy to use
Please change your interface....
"Shopping now made easy at Fingertips. Supermarket is very helpful for womens and elderly peoples as a safe shopping and delivery. Awesome experiance of electronic products, house holds and furnitures and more. must try for online home shopping. Customised and handy user interface with multiple languages options."
5 star for super fast delivery.irritated by tons of feature make the app simple interface. But most of the item are not deliverable to port Blair disappointing.
"The product search everytime throws up this error ""Something went wrong"". Not a good interface anymore.."
"Interface is better than other apps, easy to order, order cancellation & return... Product are on cheaper rates than other apps"
Best app and good and easy interface
great interface but should expand their inventory like amazon and should improve search results
Good interface and Options...
"awesome Delivery timings, Quality product,nice App interface"
interface can be better
Smooth User Interface. Easy to order.
user interface is good
Interface and word search can be improved.
"Buying experience with Flipkart is good, wide variety of products are available, clean categorisation, great user interface. But the only issue I have experienced is that delivery of a wrong product is not addressed by the Flipkart though they give us refund it will not work all the time mainly during the Big billion days."
User Friendly interface.
Best user experience app.
Love dis app. One stop destination for all my needs. User friendly interface and plus point is d supercoins u provide. Keep it up👍
Getting to much leggings while using interface is not that much cool

I like the flipkart mobile app. It has good user experience.

User interface is very easy.
4 star because of the interface. Amazon interface looks better or may be we have got used to it
Before the last update I was happy with the user experience of this app but after the update the app has got lots of wired behaviour and it automatically stops when I go to My Orders section.

User interface pahle Jaise Nahin Raha use karne mein Maza hi nahin hai
Easy & Convenient interface & Also reasonable price & best quality provided by FLIPKART
"The add to wishlist is not working properly, whenever i add something to the wishlist the app gets stuck for some time 8-10 seconds and then it says added to the wishlist. This waiting time just for adding into wishlist makes me close the app. It is very bad for user experience please fix the issue in this functionality."
"The delivery, User Interface and Everything very nice and so good"

"Great app interface, it remembers everything you see."
Good experience because great price options and user friendly interface👍🏻
"Im a long term user of this app...One of my favourite app.Interface is good except these worst things:- 1. when you select multiple items in any of your wishlists, there is no option to move them to some other wishlist. 2. when scrolling through wishlist,my orders or filtered lists and you select some item to view and come back, everytime it reshuffles and screen move back to top of the list...very irritating. Other than these flaws the app is good in all other aspects.please remove with update"
"The interface of this app, Multiple filter options and review section all are amazing. Plus membership is a worthy add on. Good job flipkart."

Best platform for online shopping in India. Almost everything you need is available. Prices are almost same on other sites. Packing and delivery is much much better than any other platform Interface is good
Keep up the good work Flipkart team! I am impressed by your user interface and your fast and uninterrupted delivery services! The only issue I have is regarding your unavailability at some areas specially of your grocery products! Many grocery options are always unavailable at my area for last four years! Hope you will resolve this issue:)
interface little bit bore
"App is great. Interface is way better than other apps. But i cant get anything to my pincode as there are no seller, whereas amazon provides some items to my area."
Its user experience is worst than before. Why its happening like this. Every time im going it will load and load and load and load. After 5 minutes only products are being displayed by your app. Please fix this issue. Im uninstalling this app amd going to use amazon
Very slow interface.
good interface to choice the items
"Guys, it's far better than amazon in terms of shopping due to its interface, trust me I have worked in a similar company as a Graphic User Interface designer."
"Very bad app interface, wishlist is very difficult....when i tap on 20 th item in my wish list and afyer my plan is go back to 21 item in the wishlist to check details, but when i press back from 20, in the next window list position goes to the top 1 st and again i need to scroll down to 21 st item to check...waste of time nd speed watchtime, u imagine if i m checking with my 1000 th item n my wishlist and my next plan is to check 1001 in the wishlist, u thnk what is going to happen next to me.."
user interface is good
It's interface is very cool and the service is amazing. I prefer flipkart to purchase.

Good shopping app Nice interface
nice app very easy to use and great interface
"Great user interface, easy to use"
"I use both Amazon and Flipkart with about the same frequency. There's something about Flipkart's user experience that's a notch above it's rivals. Narrows down the selection process, and gives you the satisfaction of purchasing the *right* product."
This is best Indian online selling platform this user interface amazin other than i liked.
super interface
Very good shopping interface
Very convenient user interface
Best app interface and easy buying.
Love using it. Nice interface. Very handy in surfing through different products.
App interface is Excellent
"Flipkart is a good app. Good uder interface, easy to browse, minimal glitches. As far as the e-commerce is concerned, I have found it really satisfactory, delivery services are also good. I am yet to rate the customer service since I haven't used it till now (which is a good thing). Keep it up, Flipkart."
good user interface
Improve user experience
lovely interface
user interface and search engine is very good better than amazon. and good offers comparatively
Reliable....the app interface is comfortable.
Wonderful user experience in E-commerce application
I always get satisfied with the price and product also if whenever I was not satisfied I changed products many times and without creating any issues flipkart helped me to get satisfied... Also it do contain various branded products ... I love flipkart and also it's interface is better than other applications
"Best shopping app,nice user interface but problem is that the updates during the tracking info of the product are not updated properly, if i have to return any product,after the pickup it should be updated like pickup time,date etc ..but nothing is updated on time."
Improve the wishlist interface. Very annoying. I have to keep scrolling back everytime I remove one item.
I just love Flipkart. User interface is really good. They have good fillter option. Good packaging with genuine products. Go for it 👍
Flipkart's interface is so good but products availability is not enough.
Nice offers and good user experience. Great deals on all Branded products.
Nice app interface
Best user interface among all e commerce apps n good deals
"Very good app , very user friendly interface, only one thing ,why dont you add an ootion for dark mode ,it helps"
"Wonderful online shopping app. One thing is lacking that is full description with more pictures and videos and specification details. If you provide it, it will improve the user experience certainly. All the best."
I am a regular customer of Flipkart. I have been purchasing items for more than 5 years . I am extremely happy with flipkart .From big to small items they have been delivering with utmost sincerity. Its user interface is superb. I never faced any problem of refund or cancellation. Thankyou Flipkart ...
Nice interface...!!
"Very poor experience, interface doesn't update the delivery details on time creates a lot of confusion, promised delivery date is not held."
Compare to other sites it's better in the view of user interface and pricing
Amended 10Jun2021 A vast improvement in the interface. Perfect world class experience. User friendly 👍. --------- A pity that flipkart has lost the plot. Such an unfriendly app. I come to this app only if the product I need is not on amazon. The app forces things upon the user and this is the most irritating part. These guys think they are intelligent but actually this way you are distancing yourself from the user.... a real pity because the desktop site was a delight.....
One of the best app but it its interface can be better
good services and app interface.........
The app interface is not good nowdays . all the time its show white blank.. you have to restart the app again nd again ..thats not good
"User friendly interface, high quality products with less price"
Good app. 3 yrs ago i had experienced a horrible service from Flipkart. But now they have improved a lot in delivery & user experience. I'm really satisfied & better than amazon.
Dear flipkart your interface is very nice but many sites makes you mod application so I request to you please take action on them
Nice n easy interface
well user experience and easy to use. valued offers available frequently.. great platform to buy things online.
User friendly interface and awesome deals.
I am loving your user interface thanks 😊🫂 flipkart
"@Flipkart team, there is no doubt that the app user interface is seamless. The 1 stars is because there is no track of where the ordered item is. The expected delivery was of today and your team has lost track of the ordered item. Now the team might not lose track of orders because Nothing is deliverable from your end."
the user experience and the app response and even the service is way better than amazon
while we type order it is not as smooth as Amazon interface
Good and easy to use interface
Good interface of app and good products
Best app good interface
User friendly interface which keep customer in loop.
This is very good app for shopping anything. It has very user friendly interface. Do anyone can easily buy anything.
"Qualified product, Good Service and delivery. App interface is really easy to access. Thanks Flipkart"
User interface is too lag
Very neat and clean user interface and multiple payment options also available. I trust Flipkart.
very slow interface
Extremely unfair ! Flipkart suddenly increases the price of several products. It deteriorates the user experience. You guys have to change only a number in the pricing by having some changes in your algorithm but that particular single number can bring a huge difference in terms of pricing & specially in the Covid era when people are unemployed & several do have their businesses shut. Please have some humanity & keep the prices constant atleast in this Covid era. Hypocrisy !
Super e commerce app better user interface than other popular e commerce stores
"Nice user experience and easy to use, and simple steps to order"
User experience is very good and the way it takes directly to the upi payment app is very good.
good interface
Much better interface and ease than Amazon or any other apps
very nice user-friendly interface liked it a lot
Great....easy to navigate User Interface and payment portal. Well done ;-)
Way better than Amazon...... As it has good user interface.and pricing
nice interface
very nice interface very easy to use good experience
"Pathetic interface, orders page isn't getting loaded since 19 mins, tried number of times to open orders page, not working at all"
"It has more items, catagory and price drop than Amazon and the interface is much more user friendly but some times product are delivered late but ok and returnes and ok and customer service is avarage but I like the app but needs improvement...."
Very friendly user interface
liked the interface and the way address is shown while searching for area
"I love (website)user interface,user friendly.No confusion and we can also look reviews. Good service."
"After the recent update the user experience has become pathetic..... Takes hours and hours to open ur Cart , to go on your orders and even for placing the order.....ONLY BUFFERING BUFFERING AND BUFFERING..... Please fix this ASAP"
User friendly interface and awesome work
User interface super gives lots of option to choose please come up with more offers and fast delivery u guys will do great then Amazon
Offers at Flipkart are better than any other sites. As well as app interface and information.
Application interface is awesome but delivery is not fast unlike amazon prime.Delivery time is same for plus member too and there no use of plus membership. Also flipkart shows low price of the product and after you will search for 2-3 times the same product will be shown with increased price. Also there is new trick to sell outdated product by not showing not deliverable to your address so similar less popular product can be sold to the users. Amazon is much better than this in terms of service
Good interface
"The interface sucks. You can only go forward but not back. It just loads and loads when you click on the back button, until you clear the app from recent apps and start all over again."
"What is your tagline surely it's not about delivery on time, pathetic interface but we can purchase small items like juta chappal for anything else not worth it."
Earlier it was working properly....now I have to restart the app again and again for any particular service request....you guys should improve its interface....make it user friendly
"User Experience is fantastic, yet to experience customer centricity, if they are good at that too will come back and change my review stars will give 5 on 5."
I have order phone and still not recive my phone and dilivery date change in one product three times change my dilivery time .i think flipkart giving best interface for user but dilivery partner. E-kart they are very worst service diliver for the dilivery reason flipkart loosing his reputation .when i am going to call customer support they are not giving correct reason why booking was delay .i am ask to raise complaint that 12 days happen but they saying we not able to raise complaint
very nice interface
why to use interface
"Company is best as compare to amazone but many time this app show error ""something went wrong please try again"" need to improve the user experience in your app. thanks to flipcart for your best services."
"Payment and User interface is good, waiting for in time and correct goods(product) delivery."
Best user interface... Vocal for local.... Deshi👍

"Flipkart user interface is too amezzing their represting way of any product is very different and real what we see actually there is actually we get and i luv it and me and my husband like very used to to use this app for ordering something,their rufund policy quick response makes this platform very easy to every user ...so i am very much satisfied for this shopping site need some improvement in seller who sometime did mistake to deliverd different colour or pattern otherwise overall is gud❤️❤️"
User interface is good.
"Timely delivery, nice response, easy payment interface"
The interface is not as good as Myntra or ajio. The number of items listed in a single page are very less because of which you have to toggle between pages again and again.
Worst QuizGames Worst interface Worst service
"I would say, the app interface is quite better than other competitors. Also, flipkart is improving its services day by day. Hope flipkart continues what its doing now, keep up the good work."
"Exceptionally well designed app, and very easy on user experience."
"The best thing that makes it better than amazon, is its interface. When u visit the amazon app and then flipkart app or vice versa you will notice tha huge day and night difference in the first glance. Amazon looks like centuries old app and they don't even want to change that a little bit, while at same time flipkart modifies its content creations time to time."
Worst app even after having the plus Subscription it takes 10-15 days for delivery and not good interface for users worst app never recommended
I love this app because of its easy interface. But distributors of flipkart are bad. Once I orderd one phone and they sell it in shop in higher price and told me that product damaged because of rain. I discovered their scam when I went to mobile shop for buying phone after 2days of this incident.
What's hell.. New interface is not user friendly.. Bcz of user friendliness interface of flipkart I'm preferring it.. Now it's too creepy..
Its super and better it is used for online shopping best interface
Easy to use and good interface
good user interface and on time delivery if you are a plus member. sometimes they cancel order on their own but overall still a good app
Apps interface are so good
Great interface to use
"Simple User interface with high quality search filter provides rich and better experience... Kudos to Pre/Post Sales, Design and Dev/Delivery Team"
Very useful and very clean user interface easy to use!
"Great shopping experuence with flipcart I want to give 10/10 score for app interface, delivery partners, pay later etc i love Flipkart, cant compare with Flipkart i used other online shopping app but some apps interface bad, some apps delivery person very rude or delaying order,and they have problems to return and refund Flipkart is best forever"
Good shopping experience with good interface and wide range of product variety.
Amazing experience...worthy opponent to Amazon..first class seamless user interface...
"Pahle ki tarah ab flipkart me mujhe sahi user experience nahi laga,ab flipkart apni policies jabardasti hm pr thop deta hai. So I'm deleting my flipkart account because I'm not satisfied."
"Superb user interface. Clear discounts, no hidden agenda. Books, Electronics, household items and now grecerry- all at very competitive prices- delievered within comfort of ur home. The rates do not fluctuate as with some other grocerry websites. Moreover when others were shirking, the flipkart delievery service was top class in Covid crisis period. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻"
"on display some items not clear about quanitiy and price, can improve user interface. Calculation is given in 250 g and 250 ml, it should be in 100g, and 100ml."
Service is excellent.........fast and accurate....very smooth user interface....mind boggling deals
Best user experience from an ecommerce app that understands the average indian consumer.
Services and products are excellent. Its app interface is better than amazon.
"Worst user experience I am sharing. I have ordered a printer. The delivery agent intentionally delayed the order delivery, and deny to deliever order. After 4 days of expected delivery day he arrives to house and said threatening words full of warning so I refuse to accept the order, then he also added to his word that I am going to use the package as it was a prepaid order. Please note that I have not provided any delievery OTP to him, but still he is saying that he wil change the order status."
cash on delivery avaliable great interface...
New update sucks!! Interface after update is really bad
The new update or the old one I dont know bas stopped showing the interface where product's details used to be written! I am utterly disappointed with the application.
The interface lags and hangs a lot
App is good and the interface is quite catchy.
"Best Indian Shopping App! Earlier,i was quite puzzled by the app's user interface and offers were also somehow doesnt ful filled my purposes but these days I m love using flipkart and yes the flipkart pay later idea is also amazzing!👍"
Good customer support. Multiple purchasing options and app have best user interface.
Thanks for an app with rich interface
Good user experience. Group by option can be given for the usability.

Best user experience in terms of purchasing any product as compared to any other e-commerce site
"The best brand to rely on. Very good customer service and prompt response on query.. Best shopping app with good user experience design. Well, I have few complaints on the purchased products (not on all products), but, I guess, Flipkart could do only little on it.. In recent time, my experience with website is not good. Products are not visible clearly in cart screen (not sure whether its intentional to encourage people to migrate to mobile app, please be aware that there are competitors :))"
Flipkart has better app interface than Amazon
Its interface is better than Amazon's

Extremely User friendly interface.... Great User Experience
"Terrible app interface, below average customer care service. Overall app sucks"
Awesome app l prefer flipkart over Amazon for an excellent User Interface. The delivery is fast with in 1 day. But recently their delivery has become slow they even exceed the the expected delivery date and for me they exceed the delivery date till 8 days which is very bad. I hope they resolve these delivery related issues or else we would have to switch to Amazon. Again delivery related Issue it was last time next time onwards I will not purchase from Flipkart.
Getting better everytime. Keep it up. Very good and easy navigations with very good recommendations. Getting better user experience every time. Getting better offers everytime. Huge number of products... Catching more attention
User friendly interface
Good Interface...
"Great app. Searching and sorting functionality works too good. But one thing needs to be improved is, after deleting from wishlist it's refreshing the page and going back to very top of the page instead of staying on the same place after delete. Its time consuming to again come back to same place where we deleted. Seen some other app where we can easily tap the heart icon to remove from the list. Please work on that to improve user experience."
"Pretty good, but the interface gets laggy sometimes."
Interface is excellent
nice interface and good offers attract more customers
Smart user interface and good application to be used
Nice user interface Easy to use
nice customer service clean operating interface
easy interface
"It's 2021. Can we get a dark mode on this thing? That apart, the user experience is pretty good. Keywords like RTX 3060 actually only show laptops with the said GPU unlike the other marketplace with a UI that belongs to 2015 *ahem ahem*"
User interface is so good
User interface is very friendly
"Good service, best app , Good user interface."
"I've ordered a product from Flipkart and after few days I got a message saying the orders has cancelled by the seller. Then they deliver that product on 7th August, and when I check the order details to return the product, the the return policy is closed on 3rd August. It's really a bad user experience that they close the return policy before delivering the product. When I called their customer support, they said they can't do the return."
good interface
"Now it's working good. Good shopping app but the price offers is slightly higher, otherwise easy user interface."
"User interface is good and easy to use, but there is one thing I have started experiencing from past few days that the application is not working properly, like even after the product was delivered it's not showing that it's delivered, and other such glitches..."
Very happy with flipkart service. Hope to see you upgrading user experience. Thanks for all your support.
"Excellent interface and ease of navigation . Never failed me in terms of ontime deliveey,quality,issues resolution. Keep up the Super Work"
Best user interface
New update interface of this app is very bad
Easy interface for everyone not messy

"Poor... Worst shopping experience, I have ordered groceries from this app it never delivers on the projected date... N shows the orders to be canceled.... N the interface is also not friendly..."
I like the interface of Flipkart better than Amazon.
user experience of using Flipkart app is bad.
User interface is great. Easy and fast to use.
Very user friendly interface
Very user friendly interface
"Unreliable delivery (delivery dates change at the last moment), awful interface and gets even worse ahead if you have to talk to customer care. Kind of sad that it says here that it is India's no.1 shopping site. However, if you're looking for a reliable service this is not the place. The delivery is so sad that I took efforts specially to review Flipkart. Cheers!"
nice app and good interface
Better than Amazon app user interface is too friendly
Best Interface ever
Nice interface and easy to use
Good user experience
Ggod Interface
Flipkart user interface is really superb and easy to navigate all product's Flipkart offers so many products in good deals price
The app is great no doubt but flipkart developers should atleast improve the interface at sometimes it clutches and glitches while browsing even the products range should be improvised for users
beautiful display or interface
App interface is too good and userfriendly
It's a good app for shopping and the one less star because Interface is kinda complicated. So it can be simplified like it's competitions.
payment interface not working properly
"Very Good User Experience, Easy to use."
Super.great in discount.good user interface app.but lack some products and some or not included in grocery
Where can I find mobile accessories section on the app 🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️can some one help me? Not everyone is interested in your mobile bonanza and some baseless offers. Understand your customer needs. I found for computer accessories as a sub category not for mobiles. Who the hell is the UI design manager or who approved this rollout ?????? Its crazy grow up guys you are loosing your customers with your crazy product categorization and making terrible user experience on the app to buy.
simple and n8ce user interface
"My only,trusted and favourite shopping aap,and it is very comfortable to use,very simple interface, so systematically managed...very good .... thank you Flipkart...better than all👌🙏 please give lovely offers and discounts everytime I shop.😋😊"
there are only 2 companies in the market that give best user experience and one of these is Flipkart. but return policy must be more flexible
Very quick purchase interface
"best app experience, user interface is perfect."
Your user interface is very worst if a customer want to contact you directly there is no option in that app like amazon its worst using of your app if we want to call then we want to chat and there want to pass like an exam then we get the call worst thing is means this is in our app dont you upgrade u fools see the amazon interface directly we can place the call. I am very disappointed worst interface while we contact to the customer service.
Trustable app and cool interface i love to buy anything on flipkart.
"Best interface,good return service and refund process."
"interface is complex, product is hadly visible only offers and supported items are visible"
It's very light weight and amazing user experience..Better search options
Best user interface compare to other platforms
"Earlier it was good but it is not user free interface, webpage is not clear in displaying categories..hate it totally.. annoying"
interface have some bugs.
App Interface is Good but their service is worst. Poor Delivery Services Poor Customer Care Cumbersome Returns and Replacement Try Out Amazon It's better and provide 24hr delivery.
After the updates this app is working smoothly..I like the user friendly Interface.
Very much user friendly interface of the app...
"Amzonaa vida ithula products quality nalla irruku avangaloda app design konjam kastama irruku but flipcart user interface much easy to use, and products oda priceum konjam differ aguthu amazon ku but comparing to amazon FLIPCART is too GOOD"
User experience was great And payment is good with cash on delivery option as compared to Amazon or other apps
Great interface
I wish it has no star rating as well...WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE SYSTEM and WORST USER INTERFACE...keeps hanging whenever I click back option....leads to wastage of time. DISGUSTING !!
interface is systematic and very easy to operate
"Bad user experience. Navigation and other controls don't get loaded some times and an absurd grey bar with error codes is displayed.. like ""SOMETHING_WENT_WRONG : DYNAMIC_NAV_BAR(Undefined)"
Flipkart has a huge variety of products. It has improved a lot on customer service and delivery partner. Interface is good too.
nice and simple interface
Quick delivery with Better offers and smooth interface.
Better user interface than other online shopping apps. It's delivery and costumer service is also good but still lot of improvement is needed to further enhance the customer satisfaction. Cons which I faced in 2021. 1) for a simple refund you have to chat or call customer care executive for at least 20 - 30 times. 2) repeatedly product cancellation from seller end. 3) usual refund time is more than 2 months which is worst among all online platforms. 4) bad customer care experience.
easy interface and simple to use
user interface is too good in this application
"When I want to buy products online I choose Flipkart more than other e-commerce apps. The best thing i like using Flipkart is the product presentation style. I mean, they maintain a clean and user-friendly user interface."
No fast delivery and in it most of the product are out of stock but it clean interface
very good customer service they will call you with in 5 minutes.very good interface it is easy to use any people
User friendly interface
good and easy interface to understand
User interface is better than Amazon and if you provides goods at better prices then you are going to beat Amazon in e-commerce.
Worst User Interface. Tried to exchange a phone. Showed pincode not available. Tried to buy without exchange. But it is not allowing me to add to cart. Saying pincode not available for exchange.
User interface ❤️ But there are a lot of duplicate products
"Best delivery and app interface is easy to use. I have used amazon, Myntra but on flipkart product images are showing clear as compare to other e-commerce site"
"Application developed well. User interface and string works well, not like Amazon. Happy with flipkart. 🙂"
Pretty helpful app with a good variety of products and cheap prices..comes with some amazing deals too... awesome shopping experience...great app to fulfill our day to day needs...truly love the app jst one thing i would prefer is that plz update the app i mean the visuals and the user interface..rest is great.. Just love flipkart shopping.. 😍😍👌👌👌
Good one comparing to other apps interface is 👍
"This app is amazing, I like the service here, how its interface is very good, the product here is value for money"
"Customer satisfaction is not given priority nowadays, they lure you to shop by providing flipkart pay later facilities but when you try to pay for flipkart pay later the amount is deducted from you but the payment is shown unsuccessful and when you ask for refund they put the blame on different upi interfaces and ask you to solve the matter with them. Uninstalling the app right now and would recommend everyone in future not to buy from flipkart. ""PLZ DONT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM FLIPKART"""
Sometimes in the app order tracking interface flickering I don't no why that happening like .
one thing i always liked about flipkart is its user friendly interface.
Last few month I face difficulties to use this app. Alot of lacking on its interface. Some of the functions are not responding welly. Flipkart have to fix these type of application based issues.
"Happy with the user friedly interface and merchandise range.Timely delivery,quick refunds and packaging are upto expectations."
simple user interface
user interface looks choppy
"I'm using online shopping apps since last 2-3 years, flipkart is one of the best online shopping app according to me. Most of the times I used flipkart for my online shopping. The app interface is very good and the products also really good.😊♥️"

"Super coins is not convertible in flipkart gift voucher it is too much bad and disappointing thing I was collecting my super coins a very long time ago and now it's showing ""this offer is not for you"" ☹️☹️ I am a Plus member of flipkart user while you said "" we are doing better user experience 😑 for your convenience""."
Been a regular customer with flipkart and i have never faced any kind of issues with this app till date. User friendly and the interface is also very simple and effective.
good but have to work on app.interface speed etc.
User Interface could be improved
Excellent app Excellent interface
"Fake rates (poco me 9.5k in interface, when you going to book then 12k🤐🤐.)"
The app is too good interface is well understandable but there's a problem in the app the new users can't login with email ID instead of mobile number
The interface and my experience with flipkart is better than any other app out there.
User Interface is just awesome

Best customer user interface compare to other E commerce and shoping websites.
Good thing about Flipkart app is that it has good interface which is easy to use as compared to Amazon. Amazon app somewhat looks clumsy to me.

Easy interface and very reasonable prices ...
"fantastic interface, easy to use ,separated options etc ... but if it has high definition graphics of items picture ,it will 5star"

This app has changed its User Experience
"Superb user interfaces, filters are better than other retail apps, too good deals... No better place for electronics in the world"
Nice interface
The interface is superb that no other online platform is maintaining...It just addicts people to shop for more time even though not necessary 😍😍...Great work by App developer 😘🥰🥰
Pros: 1. Good offers. 2. Very friendly user interface. 3. Good return and refund policies on most products. Cons: Availability of products is sometimes a problem. For example- you get a good offer on shoes. But the correct size is not available.
Very good user experience 😃😂🤗
Nice site for online purchases good experience and also user friendly interface
Good quality and gud user interface
"very user friendly interface, very good configuration at low price"
Flipkart interface is very good. The only thing I like most is the Big Billion Day sale.
"Yes! Im really satisfied by flipkart. And i can definitely say this is better than Amazon. Nice user interface, good experience from delivery team also overall Excellent!!!"
"User friendly interface, good one"
Mainly FK User interface is very simple and fast.
Absolutely amazing shopping app ... Offer is too good app interface is also good .... Product detail mentioned clearly .. payment options nice way...
Extremely poor interface and extremely slow app
Delivering good products and nice interface for payments
Flipkart App Interface is very good comparing to other big e-commerce platform.
"This is worst shopping application I have ever used. Delivery is too delay. Even our location is near they delay for no reason and customer service is worst they just prolonging the convo. Atlast they will reply sorry we are trying our best. And app interface is very bad and difficult to use., there is no proper help from application. And here comes the bot.. Natasha is better than this Flipkart Bot. You guys have to improve a lot. If it's improved I will edit my review. Learn from amazon."
"good user interface and , refund facilities are very good thank you ."
The interface is really good. Good job developer.
Need to change user interface.
Friendly interface..! loved it
Very nice interface
Most pathetic customer support and worst user experience.
"Worst user experience, totally pathetic, ordered a laptop last week, delivery date crossed 3days ago, second delivery date (f-class ofcourse) about to end, still DID NOT RECEIVE MY ORDER"
"User friendly interface, better accessibility. More convenient than other such apps."
Must use this application is user Interface is too simple and enjoy ing
This app has best user interface
"I need to share images of a damaged product. You have not given me an option to share it. No e-mail id, contact nothing. Retarded customer service. Pathetic treatment of customers. Disgusting. Wish I could rate you in negatives. With this attitude, you will go extinct in the near future. Interface sucks, customer service retarded. Really disappointed."
Bad user experience.customer service is very bad . It's better to use Amazon than flipkart in terms of services and products delivery.
its service is getting better day by day. user interface is also good and very easy to use
Worst user experience and customer service is pathetic I have register my complain so many times but not get my refound
App became too slow and laggy interface even having good internet connection unable to open pages
Make User Interface : Like way Easier to Find The Product I Buy It's very Time Consuming me to find my actual product to buy
Easy to use. Fast delivery. UI (interface) is very easy to understand
big billion days awesome. nice user interface.
"App interface is ill-planned and irritating. Instead of a simple page that lets you set filters and browse through products of interest, app provides a page overloaded with info and no visible link to skip and go directly to shopping according to user preferences/filters. e.g on clickin mobiles, i get a page full of ads,offers, new releases and all nonsense but no link to browse through all available mobiles and set filters according to my choice. Amzn app has no such arrogant forced pages."
User interface Smoothly.....
I have ordered a camera from this app and it's delivery partner ekart haven't delivered yet...... Scince they can't deliver product on time so what is the point of giving offers like big billion sale and other devali offer. They should really learn from Amazon Flipkart cons 1.They don't deliver your products on time 2.User interface sucks 3.Delivery boys don't provide the product on time when your product has reached at your nearest hub
Nice App for Online Shopping. Also Have user friendly interface
"Pathetic interface ,bad customer support and reaching out to customer support is another nonsense ,no wonder Amazon is better choice."
Flipkart is best for online shopping... and their applications interface is very friendly to use and they really give you the best rates
"Unlike amazon, After opening the application direct option on the application for seeing my order is not available. If you provide ""my order"" kind of option on the interface instantly after opening the app, It would be much more better !!!"
"From the big billion days am facing the issue when user clicks over some catergory and navigates back the app crashes..even the notification is clicked from the phone screen I am navigated to the empty page and you need to kill the application and reopen inorder to browse. @team, please take care of this serious bad user experience. Device-android"
"Fast delivery and affordable items available in this shopping app, love this , easy interface. Thank you flipkart team for this amazing product."
Best app with its better interface for online shopping
optimised correctly and good interface then amezon
Flipkart provide us a simple and great user interface. Which helps us yo use it simply.
excellent shoping platform easy to use interface.
Great User Experience.... Seamless product selection to checkout phase..... Love it. 😍
"This app has gotten worse.. There are no touch response sometimes, the interface is full of craps and it loads again and again, even when we look for a product, or scroll down, it loads again at the top. Even, I recently bought a ₹200 off on kitchen essentials for 100 coins, but the offer does not apply at all!!( It was visible for a product which i wanted to buy, and after purchasing that 'offer' ITS GONE! Waste of my coins too. Just one sentence to say, Amazon is better than flipkart. SUCKS!!"
"Wrost app interface, all time white screen problem, never solving their developers"
user interface and offers are good👍🏼
Too many bugs ... problem with user interface..it getting white on the app screen and not opening windows properly...its always loading with 50 Mbps net ... Pathetic
awesome app the interface is best of all applications in market🥰🥰
"really the best ecommerce website amongst its competitors, I like flipkart for their friendly interface and the prices they serve for the products. 🇮🇳"
there was few items not deliverable at my address but app didn't tell me which one it is. I had to try all items one by one. pathetic user experience
"Worst customer service and pathetic website/app interface. Everything's fine till everything's fine. However if you happen to be in a problematic situation with flipkart , then it would seem like a fate worse than death. Flipkart have utter disregard for customer grievance redressal."
i will use briwser instead if finally i have to go there..very bad app..hire some better professional..through app we cant make payment..app in app like interface🤮
Best interface.. Best products.. Best service.. Flipkart The Best!
Very easy interface to use and to do shopping and another interesting thing is that flipkart member plus is so easy to get.
quality stuff... smooth interface... wide range
good interface
Easy user interface
"Everything is Good but only thing I want in flipkart is to make it's interface more user friendly. like every section has proper list of product eg: renewed, flipkart smartbuy, etc. it loads little slowly and sellers information is not provided properly sometimes. otherwise I like to shop on Flipkart.. also please educate flipkart non-assured sellers."
Buying from Flipkart more often than Amazon. The deals and user experience is much much better.
Bad customer support and bad interface in mobile browser
Flipkart is best. Interface is good. All things are best in this app. I love Flipkart.
One of the best shopping site .. easy to understand also interface is good ...trusted sellar...give alot of facilititis compare to other site ....
Good user experience and service
Interface is better then amazon as u can use it properly it is usef friendly better then amazon.
devilery should be fast and interface should be easy.
"There is something wrong with the interface When I'm playing the 1minute game it automatically selects the option and don't allow me to select the option i want , later it will the wrong answer and eventually i loose."
I am giving 3 star because when I click on cash on delivery option it is locked 🔒 interface comes please pay 30 rupees in advance but I am teenager I not using upi or net banking then how I pay by upi ? Please resolve my problem
The app is crashing since the new update. Cannot search anything. Poor interface.
Smart To use. Its userinterface is very usetoo. Like the app. Perfect to Shopping. Thanks Flipkart.
The whole delivery system and app interface is good but sometimes it shows false thing
Dissapointed with the customer support executives and their behaviour. This app has started losing its charm and i feel in the near future a different app with better facilities and user interface is going to replace this. Earlier it happened with amazon & now this one. I think Flipkart doesn't bother and it's the soul reason why such idiotic persons are pushed forward.
excellent interface
"Best Place for Shopping in India With Amazing Features and Product Range also convince by emi option, Thank you flipkart to maintain and Run this beautiful business in india and create new standard of user experience"
good interface ..easy to use .. good offers
Best online shopping app and friendly interface products are good and very good quality with comfortable price. I loved it 🤞❤️
Goood interface
"Really slow app UI use Myntra or nykaa once then you will feel the difference between Flipkart apps and others e-shop apps..1st decide it's a shopping apps or a gaming apps or a insurance app or a OTT platform? Oneday your fate will be like Snapdeal .... Need more improvement to make it smooth.please remove the unnecessary gaming zone to make the user interface smooth,Otherwise good platform."
now a days app is not working properly opening and closing of new pages get freezed in white page shame on u bad user interface
it's having compatible interface to have smooth access of your orders and placement
interface is not much user friendly
"Very poor experience in user interface, whenever I open the app it keeps on loading never stops, Cart in this app is just a bug it never opens in one click, very poor maintenance"
Flipkart has excellent user interface
Used to be good but now the interface sucks
❤ the interface..way better than amazon delivery experience
App becomes white screen on its own frequently after opening any product or menu. Needs to close the app and relaunch. Very poor user experience
bad user interface
Great app with an easy to use interface.
Best of all than other apps Give us unbelievable discounts Excellent user interface Nice customer care services Finally love 💕 this one ...thank you FLIPKART

Flipkart should regulate strategic price fluctuations by merchants to ensure smoother user experience.
I love to purchase from Flipkart. The most liked feature is user interface. It is very simple and easy to use. I always found the lowest rates and beat discounts over other Apps.
The new payment interface worked with few clicks and smoothly.
aap user interface not good my refund is not credited in my account and i will not change my account in Flipkart aap
I have always been satisfied with the service of Flipkart but I would like to say I am a bit disappointed with the user interface for example adding something to your wishlist or transferring something to your own created list is quite a time consuming process.
"Very good and genuine products at an affordable price. However, the app is not running good since few days. After opening the app it takes lot of time to refresh and constantly gets hanged many times. Further after making a purchase while going to home page it again gets hanged. Request you to kindly fix the bugs and rectify the problems so that we can get seamless interface and a good shopping experience."
easly interface
"Really a good app, good interface , good speed , good money refund speed."
"Good user experience, fast delivery"
"I find flipcart to be better than Amazon specifically for electronic items and branded things. this is because they always have better prices listed offers brimming and products available which stand to be way better than Amazon. Moreover, the user interface is a lot more clean than amazon's making it easier to find items and optimise your purchase."
•very poor service. •chapri(looks like pakit mar) delivery guys. •And user interface is aslo bad. • Delivery is not fast as Amazon. •Flipkart can never take place of Amazon & also can't beat Amazon in many ways. •Last but not least you may think I am dog of Amazon but no I am genuine random guy who is just giving his feedback & also showing mirror to Flipkart. ***DON'T YOU DARE TO CONSIDER ME AMAZON'S DOG BY JUDGING MY ENGLISH YOU MAY THINK THAT I AM EMPLOYEE OF AMAZON WRITING THIS FOR COMPETITI
I like flipkart but I'm disappointed with the user interface there is no option to recover our forgetten password it's worst part of flipkart ever I'm going to uninstall this app due to this reason 👎 and switching to amazon
Esay to use interface
very poor userinterface
"Dear team,your app user interface is not good.performance is very poor.whilw clicking on back button,need to restart the app everytime.its better to work on that orekse you will lose your valuable customers."
Interface of Flipkart is so simple and its products are genuine.
Previously it used to provide better user experience in term of ui and item search operation and that was the firld it excelled over its counterpart..but now a days it's downgrading itself and that too in the area where it was actually good previously. The other frustrating matter about it is the price of some items like laptops or othet few appliances.
"I have been a plus member of Flipkart for more than 3yrs but from last one month I am having worst experience using this application. My account got blocked. I have been trying to contact customer care since last one week there is no adequate response or resolution of my problem till now. I like the application interface compare to the other online platforms available in the market, but I really feel the Flipkart should work more on their customer-care services/customer care support team."
Nice seamless transaction experience. The interface workflow is quite user friendly. Keep it up.
It's a worst app and very bad to say that I'm a plus member of Flipkart every time I search in app it is showing as something went wrong. Worst development worst interface go get some life developers
"Flipkart less or zero offers, easy to use the app, find and filter products Good. 1 star less for zero offers. Amazon great offers some times, not easy to use the app, find and filter products is a headache. Both give offers only at random. Prices gets increased during advertised Sale dates and misleading information. Good thing is both give prompt delivery. Must improvise more offers, ban fake sellers and improvise customer service and user experience."
"DEAR Flipkart, when everyone else is upgrading their catalogue, app interface, removing bugs, why you guys are giving up, like earlier if I want to purchase anything my first priority was Flipkart but nowadays their USP is -app filled with bugs, delayed deliveries, limited product options. There is an instance when I clicked on COVID essentials products which was showing oximeters, masks, nebuliser on top taken me to the trimmer buying catalogue 😂. Hadd hai"
using simple and user experience with flipkart is so good
"I am really impressed with the interface and the speed of flipkart app, So smooth in use honestly, in Amazon we face lot of troubles using the app"
flipkart user interface is very friendly. well managed.
The older ui was way better and convenient. The latest update and the changes in ui are horrible. Please restore the original interface.
because application interface is good 👍
"The app's interface is good but sometimes the sellers are not genuine one ! They sell ""fake products"" Flipkart doesn't have any mechanism or procedures to verify the seller they just simply allow seller to sell their products based on the ratings please Flipkart verify your sellers"
Kindly change UI interface if settings menu..it's very looks old
"Worst user experience, now app is getting stuck everytime, need to close and open app atleast 3 4 times than it works. Annoying"
very nice experience n a lot more better pics n interface
Good app but I'm not a frequent user so won't comment on user experience.
the interfaces is awesome 👍
legendary Application With Wonderful User Interface
Very good user interface and experience. Huge Product collection. Best platform in India for online shopping like Amazon.
nice and friendly interface
There was a time when app used to be great in terms of interface and usability. Now their interface is getting worst and app hangs at every moment.
"Always Good experience with flipcart. Best price, Assured product are truly a genuine and sure product never disappointed, also never disappointed with dilivery, this app maintains its interface flawless It makes you feel like its your own shop, it make sure you feel comfortable and anytime whenever you want untill delivery you can cancel order so....not liked but loved Flipkart :)"
Im spending nearly 2hrs for online shopping.Plz imporove the User experience. when im searching products and related products but suddenly i cant return to home or check my wishlist. I have close the app for that its irritating🙄
"Nowadays the application user experience is worst.sometimes the app shows a simple white screen while proceeding to payment, seems like an issue related to state management of the application."
"Poor interface of App. When I click on any category of grocery section it shows ""something went wrong"" and Retry."
The best online shopping app till date.. Userfriendly interface which is much better than Amazon 👌
Useless interface once coming back to home take too much time to load
superb interface.....way more better than amazon's interface.
"Facing worst experience nowadays! I use to browse in Flipkart in first place,. But unfortunately its showing ""Not deliverable"" always and if anything ordered by anyluck its getting late by day by day, and it's starts from seller before exp. Delivery date, thts funny n frustrating sometimes. You guys need to focus on Speed delivering. Thank you I don't wether I mention it or not!? A-ZN is Wayfarer than Flipkart, user experience, deliveries, return, payments, Even UI. I'm sorry."
"The best user interface with world class products range - ""a best shopping app""."
"What was supposed to be India's competitor to Amazon has now fallen greatly. The quality of products is ever degrading. But the service and support is so bad, I wish it wasn't even there. Delivery guys mark delivery as complete then go on to deliver next day. Returns are refused. On exchange money is deducted even if the back cover has a stain. No mannerism exists across the vertical and interface is like a 12th grade students project. I really pity the current status of flipkart."
"nice app, it's interface so good"
Good user Interface
Interface is amazing and convenience is also good.
Worst user interface
App takes too long to open ..It takes more time than usual apps ...You should work on technology of your app for better user experience
Interface is good but day by day page loading time is getting worst.
User friendly user interface....Great work bansal bros.
The most pathetic user experience just to change my phone number.
"The app experience is lackadaisical! There is a lag while pages get loaded. Most of us would appreciate the fact that we migrated from browser to app interface as the UXD and agility of app was commendable compared to the browser. But now, it's the other way round. For effortless shopping, I am forced to use the browser. Please mend your ways lest you fall irreversibly behind."
Don't have good user interface and worst customer support services I have ever encountered.
Day by day you guys are making this app pathetic. Nowadays it's not user friendly. You have put as much as you can. Please understand it is not always to make money on every source line but to avail customer the best user experience... So make it simple easy and quick as this app crashes very much..
Very good interface
User interface is good and easy to use.
Flipkart is best for shopping🛍️💸 coz of the interface looks great and my favorite shopping app.।।। Some things to be improved.
User friendly interface.
user interface was so good
Absolute rubbish UI. User experience is pathetic.
Very Bad Experience. Very Disappointed from Flipkart. I had requested to return my phone (realme 8) because phone was not working properly. Screen of device goes black no response from screen 😡😡. I will prefer Amazon. Amazon Gives superb user experience.
"The best e-commerce website surely , Interface of the app, no fooling around with complicated offers. The only thing that needs to be improved is delivery speed and Amazon will be left far behind. EDIT : Just now got my order in 45 minutes with that 90 minutes delivery thing, They actually read my review or what, Thanks. EDIT 2: Just got a Amazon prime membership 2-3 months ago, The app is so trash if compared to what Flipkart is offering. P.S i still use Flipkart more"
Using it for last 4 years but from last 6 months having a lot of problems with the UI as it takes such a long time to load or to go back. Such a bad experience from a reputable E-commerce shopping app. Hope FLIPKART try to fix the bugs in the user interface.
User interface is good but response time of each page frustrates its just keep loading and loading
"Great User experience compared to most of the ecommerce apps available. At times, the cart page gives me trouble Error while checking out of the cart. Please try again"
Extremely poor app and user interface..takes hours sometime to load pages.white screen everytime while loading a new page. .amazon is way better app in terms of user friendliness.
"Very slow in loading pages, some times lose interest in buying here and go to other online applications. Interface is very bad, Please do some updates or issues fix to make it smoother and faster like Amazon"
i am a plus member on flipkart but from last 1-2 months its service become worst. customer service is on the low level.now they thought they are only one in commerce world. services from call me back was pathetic they not resolving the issue rather making the call on hold or cut it after some time. chat interface is now at their worst condition. i suggest not to use this app rather use other app like amazon.
osm interface osm delivery and no fraud
Very very slow app. Getting a white screen whenever navigating or searching anything. Very very bad user experience.
Application is extremely slow earlier the user interface used to be so good now its pathetic
New update ruin all my gud experience.. worse interface I have seen ever.. please change.. it
new app update is not good interface
I love the user interface of Flipkart and get the best shopping experience. Thank you so much ❤️
Used for morethan 2years...As app loading was too fast and good user interface i became plus customer...But very Worst experience after recent update...Always slow loading...Swapped to flipkart app due to slow loading of amazon app...Now thought again need to swap...
"Really slow app, takes a long time to render. Totally disappointed with the inconvenience caused by the app. Amazon has far better user experience than this."
User Interface is Awesome.
here interface of products is well organised. and user can easily understand how to process product selection.
Flipkart used to be good earlier but I don't know why it's taking much time to open the app and after selecting the products again it's taking much time to load. Sometimes it's hanging as well. It's just disgusting in a way. Please concentrate on proper load testing and soak testing before you are releasing any changes into production. UI is good but User interaction/ experience is getting worse. Please concentrate on user experience it's the main thing!
Worst user experience after update Please bring back previous version It is some how tough and laggy after update Hope you understand and resolve it 🙏🙏
"User experience is not at all good, please try to make it good, app opening time is very bad and also sometimes it won't load"
Buggy app..... I used to surf it on 3-4 hours daily before when it was running smoothly but now it get bugs from 2-3 months and it lags when you open new product page or come back to a page..... Now amazon is providing more better user experience
"Flipkart software and interface is eazy to use , then other online shopping app. thanks Flipkart for providing grate discount and survive 😊😊"
This is by far the best online shopping app in the country with an attractive interface and clear functions and has got a wide range products at the best prices for most of our needs...and also an amazing customer care support. Cheers!
The app has become extremely slow. Please do something or else all customers will switch to other shoppings apps. Really slow interface.
Mast hai bhai and very simple and square interface on Flipkart but in other companies like amazon are very poor interface
App interface and all are good. But one thing couldn't see my account details. If i click on my account it's showing nothing. Because of this i couldn't add e flipcart gift card pin and voucher code. Please look after this issue. Rest all good.
"Didn't find any reason to not rate flipkart with 5 star. The app interface is so simple and user friendly. Also the services are amazing. They deliver intact products before the due date. Lastly, flipkart is so trustworthy. Really happy to shop from flipkart. Thank you!!"
Please fix the response time of the app. The app is very slow. It takes ages to navigate from one interface to another.
super fast delivery on comparison to other shopping sites. could improve the interface and specific search results but they have a wide range of products!
"Flipkart has a disgusting refund policy. Worse interface. Unable to change mobile no. and email address. Customer care has no knowledge and untrained. It seems flip kart is doing cost cutting to not to train their customer care. There is a reason why we Indians prefer to shop on snapdeal, amazon rather than shopping on flipkart. Giving you 1 star is too generous of me."
user interface with Flipkart is very easy. Even an illiterate can easily understand the Flipkart online shopping process. I hope you don't bring any adds & irritate the users...
always the best user experience
"User experience of this app is TERRIBLE!!! 1. It shows blank white screen, whenever you click the back button. Have to reopen the app to continue!!! 2. While opening item links, loader never resolves. ( happens even for links in Flipkart Advertisements *slow claps*). 3. Success in adding items to Wishlist is like tossing a coin. 4.Sometimes skeleton screens never resolve while searching, Also Carousel is often always slow/stuck."
Very bad user experience after updating with recent update. App is not opening and taking to much time to load even excellent internet speed. After uninstall the app and reinstall App is working fine. Thank you.
"This application has superior user-interface experience compared to amazon, and the delivery is fast. It is also made in India, which is awesome."
poor Interface
New update is very pathetic. Very terrible UI(USERS INTERFACE)
user friendly interface
Hey please change the user interface it's awful for such a big platform. How can you compete with amazon with your app looking like that. All small and big thumnails looks terrible. This needs some serious brains to change. Please consider.
Worst than my jio app! Latter u all know. Previously it was ok but from last 1 years I am noticing I has downgrade like worst interface uncountable gliches works like a sloth :(
App Interface is good But it's working very lag
I don't like this flip kart new user interface Old one is best New one is looks like cheap and Very difficult to use
I am editing my review because the interface got changed. I felt that the earlier user interface was better. Having tha cart and catagory option obove the screen. If possible please change it again.
Worst interface app now after updated
"App is not working freely, always keep refreshing when u switch from 1 interface to other.😑"
the new interface is annoying please give the previous interface
Very annoying interface after updating flipkart
Latest updates are the worst the interface of the app is one of the worst please change it to old one
user interface is slow and lagging. even in the new update.
"Very bad interface after updated. Search bar given bottom, it should be on the top."
"Recent update made the app very slow, and the interface also changed which confusing please update the app to make lag free and user interface must be user friendly not confusing"
App is lacking after new interface update... Plz fix the bugs..
"Very bad experiance ,, slow work ,, slow open ,, slow interface,, same to amazon apps.! New interface isn't good ,, as to compare previous interfaces..! Order section not direct open..! Coins section not direct oprn..! Menu option not available..! Bad interface this updtes..!"
"Easy for shopping. After latest update,user interface is not good. Please provide notification and other functions one touch enable."
"Date : 02/03/2022 Bugs ... a lot of em. Flipkart's mobile app was one of my favorites innmobile shopping . It's loading time and overal user experience was good when compare it to competition. But.. Now when i press back button the app get stuck in plank white screen , The only solution is to restart the app . Even though that was annoying , it was usable. After the latest update these loading screens apear in between normal loading screens , so now the app is iseless."
I had to downgrade to older version. Rubbish Interface after Update
peerless user experience...
Great interface but can be improved . But overall experience is good and easy to use
The app crashes literally everytime.We cannot even wishlist or place orders accordingly. Even we change the address details it stops and a blank page appears. I was so satisfied with it's user interface. The best in shopping apps. But the failure of the app creates scar in it. It is sad that FK can't solve the issue with 3-4 updates. I've updated so many times which I would think the prblm would be solved but it doesn't. Utterly disappointed. This is gonna lose fk's trust by its users&business
the app is getting worse day by day. Maximum number of items are not deliverable and the app interface should get improved
"I'm Flipkart user since it's beginning, awesome deals, good user friendly interface."
"The worst update..I couldn't Enter the app The App get Struck,I couldn't even see Reviews,and Product Review Photos. It's keep on Showing ""Something Went wrong"" ....Fix this issue it's very Irritating I have been using Flipkart for the long time..But this Update made it very very Worst ...Such a Bad user experience"
Achha khasa to interface tha app ka kya bawasir bna diye ho ye
It's a worst app i think in UI interface it was not like this before check and clear this
"Too much of bugs in the app, Older version is much more polished than this newer one... And the interface is way to complicated i like the older interface"
The new user interface is very bad. Can't even see my orders. To see the oders I have to go to the my account section and then my orders. But in the previous version it was so easy to see the oders. Please 🙏 Make the user interface like it was before.
"Horrible customer service. Tried to return a product, but the return got cancelled saying it was defective. But no one even came to pick it up in te first place. The horrible customer service interface prevents people from directly accessing any chatline or call service."
All experience is good but sometimes the app get stuck or goes blank. Kindly fix it. However It's easy to use and great interface.
bad 😞 interface after update... difficult to find my orders and supercoins
Poor user experience. Most of the time it's lagging and feels very slow . App doesn't open properly. You need to make this lite like previous versions. You're putting lots of useless features in a shopping app. Really unsatisfied!!!!
Last update has made the app too slow.. Kindly fix it is badly effecting the user interface with the app.
"Since Last few weeks this app automatically changing user interface, some time i can't find grocery section some time no reward section, its too annoying for me. After this i installed 2 other apps"
1. Latest updates in context of UI/UX is not good. Previous App was best in terms of User Interface. 2. If I have to add multiple items to cart from my wishlist.. I'm unable to add at a time + if I add one from 200 Items and want to add second one I have to browse it from the No. 1 Please work on your app and do fixes. Sandhya
Worst App Ever When I use this app then suddenly after going back from product page it gets blank and after some time then it gets back to home page. This thing is really irritate me a lot. I am facing this thing for a very long time. Also the new interface of this app is so bad. Overall my experience with this app is so bad.
User interface and design is good but many times it shows blank screens or loading time takes forever (keeps going until the app is closed). If the devs fix this then the shopping experience will improve drastically!
"Worst . This app is a scam. Worst customer care, worst interface and worst experience . Hands down they cheat you out of money, make you wait a month and cancel your order when asked for solution . Case pending in consumer court."
It's interface was too good. But after updating the app has become worst in market from the best in market
"App doesn't work all time. Something went wrong shown all time. Flipkart grow upward in user experience not backward, app loaded with outdated features."
"I used to love Flipkart's User Interface but the latest Update really sucks. Why not keep all the options like Wishlist , My Orders, My Account in a single drop down menu as it was before rather than shuffling across each section which makes the browsing experience slow. Roll back the past version and keep it simple and fast."
Very nice interface and easy to use.
I love it's interface it's very much easy and familiar as compared to Amazon's interface. A great Indian App. Edit: Needs Optimization urgently.
interface not doing well
"App crashes frequently, very slow and should work on user interface...I personally feel amazon is way ahead in it. For ex, If i am searching for shoes, amazon shows similar products and colour options on same page..plus whn they show they have actual availability of the product (size wise, colour wise) you need to check the stock..most of the time i have seen products are not available..this is why i prefer amazon more than flipkart... Well, return policy and customer service no issues for me."
"Such a nonsense interface. Upgrade it asap, its just becoming too bad to use the app. Very dissatisfied and disappointed"
"App new interface make it worse, app works very slow, hanging. Flipkart should give updates for there old interface, that was easy to use,"
The recent versions have changed the user interface of the app which isn't user friendly at all.
The interface in my phone has changed i hate that please change it back to normal
Adorable user interface
Search option not in interface
Best online Shopping platform. Brings wide variety of products and app interface is so ease even for old ppl. I respect your hard work Team. Keep doing same.
Very bad experience after the new update the app not load any page it show only white screen page loading time is too much only white screen show and lag more Fix this problem and change there UI interface
"The new interface of this app is now so complex than previous, personally I don't like it."
"I mostly liked the user interface experience for Flipkart. Accessible to search products, properly catalogued each product, detailed transparency on products made me a prominent buyer on Flipkart. One thing I would suggest is to stop listing rubbish sellers on this platform, it makes our shopping harsh, and your brand's reputation may get hampered. As an MBA student, I highly regard your business and wish you to continue on the quality track so that we, as consumers, can keep our brand loyalty."
Very slow and laggy interface after so frequent updates. It's irritating to use the app. Always asking for updation (interval of a week)
"Really fed up with this , even though amazon is laggy sometimes but is way way way better than this in terms of customer service, interface and on time delivery and infact fast delivery , it showed me the delivery day today but still didn't get the parcel really must work with their delivery partner and customer service , really annoying , can't even load a single page even on high speed internet connection , really really disappointed ...."
Don't like the new interface... The menus were better on the upper side... Now as it is on downside its not user friendly.... Atleast i don't like it...
"Lags alot, worst interface"
nice app very nice and with simple interface for me so give it 4 star because some of problems & glitches.......but nice
App User experience total degrading with every update. Now all the options including three dots are moved to bottom of the page. It feels frustrating moving fingers everytime to bottom of the app while searching anything.
good user experience
"Please make your interface better , do something to get my order page directly"
Easy to shop.. Good interface..
"lagging a lot, not smooth interface like before.."
User experience is great and easy to use. I like it very much
Such a wonderful app for shopping. It is too easy to shop in this app. It has a good interface for shopping and also to make shopping easily.
"The new look to the app is not as good as the earlier one. Three horizontal lines at the top left corner is scrapped and so it is not possible to easily navigate through orders, wishlist etc. Please include customer friendly interface/design."
"Very Cheap Update....ruined the app interface, previous version was better than this"
Worst user interface and worst service
Iam after updating the interface was bad before the app interface nise
"bookings made easy with easy and clean interface , unlike amazon 🌝"
Lovely user interface. Adherence to delivery schedule. Diligent delivery agents.
slow interface
4 star because experience achha hai shopping ka. Lekin new update se app ka interface bekaar ho gya use karne mai bekaar lag rha hai very bad interface.
Editing my Review on 26th March 2022 Now Flipkart is no more user friendly it is quite difficult to understand and be comfortable with the new interface.
Where is my orders option why you're making complicated interface
The new UI is super horrible.Earlier this app used to be great and easy to use.But now the whole user experience has degraded.Search option is not visible after opening the app.
"New Review from 2021- Mar 2022 Very worst response from Flipkart. After explaining your problem the customer service representative puts your call on hold. After 1 min, the call will disconnect. This is happening since last BB sales. They don't have morals like Amazon. Thats why people love trust even Amazon don't have good USer interface. I'm using flipkart from 2014 and I did not expect worst service from. Great shopping site."
more than usefull and nice interface
May be it is a good app for shopping but it has worst interface I couldn't login cause I had login it a time ago and I don't remember password application don't have any option to reset it
bad 👎 interface
Shittiest interface interface adapted so far.
New interface is not good Old was excellent and Easy To use
The worst app interface or homepage i ever seen in flipkart... really disgusting
Very worst update this time I can't see my order information and I don't contact the customer support option That app user interface is very unsatisfied 🤦
"Please rectify the voice assistant popping up every time, this is making user experience a annoying one. Couldn't even properly search for an item or view anything every time this msg pops up on every single touch....."
"1 * for worse update (version 7.40/7.41) of the app. Restore the ""Old interface"" plz."
In one week how many times i need to update this so that it works with its all interface
Less interactive interface
Easy user interface super shopping app
The interface is now lets say dropped a level and the unnecessary hike in products prices and delivery charges are bothering.Otherwise its a good app
flipkart is doing great.thry managed to optimize thier user interface
Nice User Interface
very good interface and offers
Previous interface of flipkart was better
where is the search bar? when other apps are updated better than previous one....you guys ruined your app's user interface worst day by day.
"Very bad experience with Flipkart payment interface, when I ordered my product they cancelled, after 1 day they refunded my money whenever offer sale was over"
I decreased one star because of the new interface..
Bestest shopping app and my best friend for suggestions. 😊 And services provided by FLIPKART is UYLIMATELY AWESOME with COOL interface. 😍❤️ LØVē iT ❤️😍
"Poor Service, I 2 time received a defective product I raised the Return Request both time the expected day got passes and after return period got over m not able to return the defective product... I contacted the customer care executive he she says m keeping the call on hold for 1 min to check the details n then after 5-7 min calls gets disconnected automatically ... Very poor service n poor app interface"
The app was very lagging ever time I enter or I moved from one page to another I am always able to see only white screen for long time it makes user experience very bad
one of the trusted shopping app ever.. I change my mind after update of application and gave 3 star.. . It is too much lagged and UI interface also complicated.. I love previous version alot..
Flipkart is becoming worst now. The end user experience is so bad.Flipkart's exchange policy is trap for everyone.It has to change it's way to treat with customers in a good manner.
"Shame on you flipkart Worst user experience For sure never going to buy again on this app, will definitely be ready to pay Rs. 500 extra on Amazon or any other app but not Flipkart for sure Really pissed off with the service and overall experience 👍 Even these local vendors app are way more better than your app"
Nice interface 👍
"Need to change application interface cool then bring new collection and products, update to every day and fashion, set a reasonable price,"
"Previous interface was much better, give us a direct ""my order""option"
"The poorest app ever , with no proper customer care nothing , just they have build up an app and are sitting like fools poorest user experience there are many other alternatives go for them"
New interface is bad please bring the old one
Nice app only need to add some branded products and improve the app interface and also fast the app than it can be better than other shopping apps
"page needs to be refreshed every now and then. This issue needs to be resolved, it is a bad user experience."
I don't like new interface of your app
"User interface is so difficult to operate, I was unable to find the recent order option, idk where it exist, improvement in user interface is much needed, this is the last time i am ordering something from flipkart"
"The customer support interface is very frustrating. The chatbot doesn't provide proper options which are limited and confusing. It says I'll get a call back in 11 minutes from the agents but doesn't do anything. If you exit you're unable to see previous chats or access that window unless you start a complaint. Very confusing. Used to be my favourite shipping platform but after calling the customer care multiple times and still facing the same issues, will think twice before ordering again."
Good interface..Rates are very cheaper then local store..Just loved it.
"I love the interface and the way products are displayed. Some of the other aspects are wider collections, value for money and quality products. Kudos to the entire Flipkart team."
New interface is not good
Do not change the interface so frequently
every time the app lags...full of bugs non consistent...slow interface.. fix the problems
"Never seen such a dumb application, there is no option to help you out if you forget your password, it keeps saying unable to process request, you can't even reinstall it as it is showing error. Frustrating user experience."
Very good search interface....easy to access products
Excellent user experience. Only problem with flipkart is that most of the items are out of stock always. Edit: Amazon is way better now. The search on flipkart js plain and simple broken. I hardly get the product that I searched for in the search bar.
New interface is pathetic
"Worst..Worst..worst... Such a horrible experience. Never recommend or suggest this app again. Customer service is terrible. They are not at all trained. Also the help center interface is too bad. Not resolving the issue but still updated as resolved. Delivery date is extended 3 times unnecessarily without even informing. Not even responding properly. Also they do not have any details of their hub, delivery partners."
Very poor UI interface Customer care is very unresponsive and take huge time in loading the app
Flipkart payment gateway loading page is not interface this bad for purchase product
The customer support interface is very frustrating. The chatbox doesn't provide proper information. It says I'll get a call in next 11 min from the agent but doesn't do anything . Very bad service provided by Flipkart😡
"Good application,, very easy interface"
the customer support interface is very frustrating
User Interface is becoming worst day by day
Laggy app Lots of technical issues Slowest user interface Showing all products out of stock No proper customer support Going to uninstall it
"Please create a DirecT my orders button. Like at bottom, remove Useless notification tab in the middle Or at top add a my order tab ""Flipkart Grocery My orders"" at top. Current interface requires two whole steps, which is not fast enough."
Great app for shopping. Flipkart is easy to use as it has user-friendly interface.
"Worst experience the app hangs up, they first showed delivery on 18 April now it shows 24 April and when I try raise issue they freeze the app. It has the worst interface, it's better to shop from other sites than flipkart"
"I was nt expecting tht from flipkart, tht it gt stuck on loading while my other app work's absolutely ok bt wit this app again & again after trying so many times it doesn't open. All dho i login flipkart platform several times bt after few days later after downloading this app, it's getting stuck in start of the interface section showing 🔆"
app is glitchy. interface can be better.
"Very bad user experience, the app keeps giving white and unresponsive screen ,the issue is continuing from so long the should really make there UI smooth"
India's largest online shopping platform has worst app to deal with...user interface is quite poor one..it keeps u waiting all d time .. turning into a blank screen...it really sucks..whole experience of shopping becms so pathetic. Why don't u fix it asap.
Wrost User experience 🤮 need to more improvement ui
Extremely poor customer support.They only apologize and can't resolve. More than 3 orders were pending for more than 15 days. Even the delivery person returmed without delivering the product even after the security asked to keep and lied that security denied. More than 8 times i have spoke to customer support Very poor response. I am not using flipkart anymore. The customer support interface is worst. Past the due date also it shows it will be delivered in past. DONOT OPT FOR FLIPKART EVER!!!!
"I can't use the slide for 'my orders' and stuff because i use gestures for navigation in my phone, didn't you guys test the app for normal people who use gestures. just change back to the old interface,( why did i updated this😮‍💨)"
"the products are fine, but the delivery services and follow up during any issues by customer support is pathetic. the app interface for customer support is not useful either. the delivery service person blames the tech support and vice versa, that's quite lame. they cancel the order themselves without informing the customer and come up with a reason after weeks! also some products are overpriced here when compared to other e commerce websites."
"Flipkart have made its interface so much better, refunds are made just after the pickup of the parcel, parcels reach to it's destination 2-3 days before the delivery date and customer care service have been so much better. Great improvement Flipkart."
Worst return policy ever seen Worst customer support they said the excutive will call in 10 mins they call and cut the phone Parcel will be expected to be return at 18 April 2022 still there is no one came for pickup and our amount will be stuck with them Worst service worst user experiences.
Very bad user interface
"When the app is opening, the initial loading page takes forever to load. Overall the flipkart app is very laggy & buggy. It stutters half of the time. The UI (User-Interface) freezes quite often."
App is getting slower day by day.. while ordering something (just before the payment page) the app undergoes prolonge loading. Pissing off the user experience..
Nice user interface
Best Shoping app ever easy to use. Icon's interface are awesome ..
User interface is very nice
"App user experience is nice but since 1 year I'm not able to login to account. I tried calling their customer service number, even mailed them my issue and still wasn't able to log in. I tried logging in into my account using phone number and OTP as I forgot my password but it shows ""Login with OTP is unavailable. Login with password"" and then i entered my phone number and clicked on forgot password but it shows ""Unable to process request""."
"The customer support interface is very frustrating. The chatbot doesn't provide proper options which are limited and confusing. It says I'll get a call back in 11 minutes from the agents but doesn't do anything. If you exit you're unable to see previous chats or access that window unless you start a complaint. Very confusing. Used to be my favourite shipping platform but after calling the customer care multiple times and still facing the same issues, will think twice before ordering again."
"Flipcart have a variety and best match prices, supprotive customer service. Easy to use interface and the most important fast delivery."
Wrist Experience With The Interface whenever you try to search Something It's lagged and also when You click back option. Flipkart if you reading this then please fix your lagging System not the language system. Thank you
After recent update it becomes more slower than previous version. Web interface loading takes much longer time. Please resolve the issue.
Worst app the customer service interface is very bad as we cannot even contact with the customer executives only chat bot rply that they will call you within 11 mints but they won't even contact you nor even respond for messages.... Very worst service
"Last update make it very slow, interface won't even open"
Customer support interface is really frustrating. I am fed-up with telling my issues again n again to executives. It's being more than 1 week that I raised my query still there is no resolution. The only thing I'm getting that is your issue will be resolved on this date but it never happened. Now the call is also disconnecting between again n again. This is the worst experience ever. Now I don't think that I'll be order something from Flipkart again
"The customer support interface is worst. Ordered a mobile phone on 14th March and still waiting for delivery. Worst service, Worst experience."
"Worst user experience, they (flipkart, seller) didn't mentioned proper specifications of products, and don't have return option if we got wrong by specs product, customer support? 3rd class ( they don't have proper answer of my questions, they just tell what written on product title, they don't what is that product or what is answer of my questions they just chilling and tell to cancel my order if i want. Gandu"
The new interface is bad
Very good app and easy to use for it's simple interface.
Poor interface
new UI is not so much good old interface is best one
"Customer care support interface is disgusting...won't provide proper options .. call service is too worst...won't even call back in reported time...I've order a phn case... recieved empty box, raised a complaint but didn't respond"
Now it's very difficult to get on the next interface from the previous one. Taking longer time than usual. Flipkart should fix it immediately for customer's hassle free usage.
I love flipkart... Its interface is very easy to use.... can go for it without any hesitation...
My favourite shopping aap Customer support interface experience is very good
Such a degraded customer service The user interface is so irritating and delivery executives are so annoying..he wouldn't answer the call or not deliver my order even if he was very close to my area ...then I just get a message from flipkart saying my order delivery will be delayed by 2 days What kind of service is this
"In some itmes, size chart doesn't have the option of matching the numerical size with the alphabetic size. Also the user interface needs to be improved."
The customer support interface is very frustrating. I ordered mobile 15 days ago but still don't know when it will be delivered.😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
"Flipkart app interface is good ,easy to use but delivery is such a headache. In the last month itself two of my products got delayed after reaching nearest hub and got cancelled at last. And now I have ordered tws earbuds one week ago and I was supposed to receive it on the the 3rd day and it got delayed several times like some 6 days. If Flipkart won't leave ekart logistics or if it won't improve its delivery the company is gonna close"
"flipkart app is always hanging. one star app only high rating because of previous versions. On payment, app hangs and redirecting after payment app again asking for payment page !! It is better to use chrome for flipkart rather than this cheap app. amazon app is much better than this flipkart android app. please make the smooth and lite interface as like recent amazon app."
Worst customer service! Website & app is also not user friendly. Very bad user experience. Amazon is far better than flipkart!
How many years are you people in this business? Still a pathetic user experience to place an order? I suppose Flipkart finds the best way to lose business! It says my number is too old to login and the only option provided is to call customer care that sends recorded message about order tracking and auto disconnects. Flipkart won't allow me to use chat support without logging into the account...come on team login itself is the problem...can you reactivate my account immediately???
"Aap is very easy to use and organised. based on my orders, quality of products is very good, shipping is up-to-date,and customer friendly and one thing to say that l like the interface of this application"
Customer support interface is very good👍👍
Worst updated interface. Now we cannot access my order secrion from top left thee line menu. As is it removed by the app developers. They must be drunk during development.
"Love to shop at flipkart..excellent customer service,easy user interface,good recommendations for the searched products..thanks flipkart & team."
The app and it's features are good and I also like the packaging of the products.I appreciate this app also for it's user interface. COD NOT Available ..
easy to use interface with minimal glitch its really good experience shopping here with amazing deals
"Can't change my old mobile number with my new mobile number, i lost my old mobile number, worse user experience, why you guys paying lakhs for this kind ux to your ux department."
"Poor user interface. Whenever i click my order, i cant open orders."
Update is wrost payment interface is not showing it still remains loading
Awesome experience nice user interface thanks to Flip kart
Overall app new user interface is good but 1 thing I want is make orders section more handy instead of going to account than order section
"Unable to update KYC, trying from past several days but the interface is in maintentaince it seems, neither the customer executives are helping me out."
User Interface👌👌
Your earlier user interface is good but your new user interface is so difficult to use and understand!
the app interface easy to use
Flipkart is gaining customers day by day with its offers and promotions. most importantly timely delivery and attractive User interface
Easy to use interface for shopping with ease. Nice Discounts with good brands. Best for shopping at genuine price tags. Love shopping on Flipkart.
"The app doesn't any interface to customer care only they can call you when they want after you raise a complaint, the customer support employees doesn't talk properly and put you on hold then cuts the call intentionally, the customer care chat is very depressing to talk with a bot that doesn't understand your commands"
"Worst experience, my order is supposed to deliver two days back no update yet, customer support interface is very poor,"
"Did you guys ever used AMAZON! That's call an app, where user can easily use it..... And flipkart app is a worthless product of some useless developers mind... Where use can lose the user experience... Are you sure that you checked it before launching it?and also think that it is presentable!"
"the theam of Flipkart (yellow & Blue) is very good..., but the app interface is lightly complicated as compair to web interface, Ex. if i want to see my order or track my order then i have go to account then click on my order then this page showing my order status, and the notification is not cleared after reading...."
"Bad experience, no forgot password options. Very irritating interface."
New user interface is so irritating. You can't open your wishlist or order section easily.
user interface is better than Amazon
Complete user-friendly interactive interface
Superb but Amazon Website interface is much better increase variety and more products
user experience is pretty good but need some important 👍
user-friendly interface.
Customer support interface is worst. Worst services being offered by flipkart. It's been more than 17 days and they are unable to deliver the order. The app is worst. There is no interaction provided in app with customer care executive. All time their chatboat responds which always give one message that have patience. We are working very hard to deliver your products on time. I have never seen such unprofessionalism from any organisation. Pathetic service
App interface is Awesome user experience is also good
"Worst interface and no response from customer care, worst app I never seen. Better to not use this app"
Very dirty interface right now older interface much better
super user interface
"Glitchy like NEVER Before 😠. Blank screens and no network displays are all that this app is upto now. Put some money in R&D for App interface rather than investing in useless Play & Win schemes, Games, Supercoin, etc."
It's intuitive and quick. Enjoyable to say the least. Edit: customer support interface is very bad. It is convoluted to access the orders page. App fails quite a lot more.
"It's a good app , nice interface and better user experience. that's why I give 5 star out of 5 . If my order is not deliver at delivery date then I will give one star."
New interface Utterly disappointed
Stop changing the UI so frequently. To be begin with every iteration is worse than the previous. Then you change the interface so much that it makes the app confusing. Also why the UI UX design like the app is for kids. Take time and fix the interface for once and all
"Okay, now I like the beautiful interface of the app. It really looks nice, easy to shop. Thank you Flipkart."
Good interface and wide range and variety of products but I faced while placing order for groceries. They should fix the order issues.
Bad interface and bad customer support
Poor interface
nice user interface
The new interface flipkart has come up with is pathetic and unintuitive
This time using flipkart is very difficult. User interface is very bad after new update.
New app interface is little bit bad for me to view products and details as compared to old one
After latest update its user interface has been combined with grocery which is very irritating in using the Application. Before update its user interface was awesome.please change its look as it was earlier.
"dont like new interface, unable to find wishlist"
After the new update you ruined the whole user interface which was known for best user friendly interface in shopping apps . Pathetic interface. Please change it .
Its Fast & Good User Experience.
"New interface is not comfortable and having design inconsistencies. Need to go to another page to get the product categories, while it was readily available in earlier version. There is a tab to go to groceries section from flipkart. This tab will disappear as we enter into grocery section. So we can't go back to flipkart from grocery."
This update is very poor UI please restore old Ui interface
After updating this app interface is very bad
The update user interface is tooo bad
"Its user experience has become wosrt now a days , suddenly gets blank out, and facing a lot of problems."
Worst update interface not good old version very fast working and interface Very attractive
Old interface is best for easy navigation..... Please change it........ No body like this interface
I have changed rating from 4 stars to 3 stars because after updating recently the app interface is getting kinda stuck
"My One Place to shop Online. Timely Delivery, Great Discounts, Free Shipping and Easy App Interface are my Favorite about Flipkart!"
The new interface of Flipkart is too boring and not good. Old one is better. In new interface the account section is not opening altogether it takes too much time to load flipkart. Such a boring experience with flipkart nowadays. I want to request you to please change this interface and bring back to old one.
After update the interface is pathetic Loved the previous one Filter option is not working properly
I had flipkart installed but I opened it the screen went blank. I tried to login refresh but didn't work. I uninstalled the app to install again but the installation is showing pending even though my network is fine. I am not able to use Flipkart and many other interface challenges are being faced after Flipkart's recent app update.
I was unable to access flipkart pay later the interface is showing me with in 60 seconds everytime but not processing the
"Did a previous update pre-emptively roll out the new interface and layout, which was later returned to the original? It seems so on my end, a shame too; the newer layout was quite refreshing."
Old feed and interface is best. New interface is complicate
Change the bloody interface for swipe panels in the app...all phones have gesture based navigation now. Old version was fine
"Customer support UI, interface experience is worst, whenever tried to request call back, we are getting a message saying that we tried to reach but not successful.. On earth, What network are you using? Unbelievable 😏 and delivery is another horrible service, it took all most 5 days to deliver a product with in the same city but still product not delivered"
Plz bring the older interface this new interface is just worst and like nightmare to use
App user experience needs improvement.
Very poor interface..
The new interface is worst of all time. I couldn't find my orders and other stuff like my wishlist. Flipkart should provide the old interface. It was best.
I really curious to know what is th reason for not giving direct navigation to home page in Flipkart app . Is this dark side of user experience
"New interface is pathetic, not user friendly"
After update the interface is annoying Old version was pretty comfortable
new updated interface is not good having trouble to find option like wishlist because you removed menu bar idiots
I really don't like the new interface of the app... & It's bit seems the app is slow !
Dont like the new app interface. Where is my wishlist ?? Why some products are now not returnable???
The updated Flipkart app is nonsense interface.. I don't know who designed this nonsense interface and how Flipkart approved this.. Now Amazon is comfortable.. switching to Amazon...
After the new update its interface is very complicated
"This app has stopped to show (buy now) option, like seriously, the section where it was there, that stupid ad has taken place. And now i can't buy anything. Who the hell designs that kind of interface."
I'm unable to adjust with new interface; where the wishlist window had removed from the front . I'm not satisfied with the new interface of the app. The previous interface was much better than the new one . It can be redesigned.
Worst user interface
"The new interface has live stream pop up, which is highly irritating. Have to close it every time I come to home page. They could better have created a tab below for that purpose. Highly annoying."
"Post recent update, the app become unusable. Interface too bad and cannot trace previous orders."
"The new interface have too many pop ups, feels like i entered am adware website and the flight booking interface is too slow keeps loading forever."
it's just a fabulous app now.....early it's development and user interface is also so easy to use☺️👍
New update interfaces very bad and complicated
Worst interface
New update is such a trash. Stupid and confusing interface. Very pathetic user experience after the last recent update. GET US BACK THE OLD INTERFACE. THIS IS TRASH.
The new interface is pathetic.. not at all user friendly. utterly disappointed.
"New user interface after update is nonsense, have to make so many selections for wish list and order status. Older UI where customers can wishlist items directly was good. Please change it to older UI."
"The new interface is so disturbing and irritating everything is just got hard to find... The wishlist, The credit option, my orders actually everything..."
Your latest update is really irritating.the app doesn't function properly .it can't even load the home page.the new interface is so bulky and confusing. I can't even open the app
Bad interface
After every update its user interface becoming worse
New interface is a disaster.... Make different app for grocery😒
"Nice one, good interface, quick response"
Very poor and messy user interface
Interface is must
"Why did the User Interface have to change, it was great they way it was and right now its absolutely disgusting. Please revert back to the previous UI"
The user interface after the updated is worst. App became more complicated to use and purchase.
"Very slow interface now, even to see the order history, it takes around 1 min.. Kindly improve and fix the bugs. Otherwise, we have to leave this app."
Improved a lot from the previous user interface n pg layout...easy to search n quick results. Finally got GST Invoice option to claim GST credit. P.S no GST invoice for certain goods error message. Why no GST input credit on air conditioners? Want to buy SanDisk dual pendrive c type 128gb which most of the time is not deliverable at mumbai or shows out of stock. Nowadays Tata cliq provides better pricing and offers than flipkart.
"Flipkart app has very familiar interface comparing to another same one. Lekin ""uncha dukan fika pakwan"" muhavara ekdam sahi hai Flipkart ke liye, kyunki koi bhi bakwas item Flipkart mein becha ja raha hai, savdhan rahe satark rahe. Above post was made by me in 2020 not new interface of Flipkart is much pathetic one."
Old interface is best then Please provide update look and feel
User experience is awful
"Now your app's interface look like other Chinese shopping apps. Old Flipkart was better and easy to use.now tough to use ,laggy even product quality also decreased"
Give back the old interface The new one is so f*up
New interface is worst. Can't access to my orders quickly
Products are often overpriced here. Very laggy user interface these days.
Flipkart interface not good compare to old
After updates the user interface is so unfriendly and hectic. Would prefer the old version
"Your previous User Interface was good but the new one (in which notification, my account section and so on is below) is a headache to use. Previous UI (in which all the options were available at left hand side by clicking on top three lines) was an easier one."
"After update it full of bugs, most of time it loading and back button not respond. Need to fix a lot in this. User experience is not good after update."
This interface is not good
excellent interface
"nice offers, very good interface. keep it up"
"What the heck!? Even though my internet is good, I cannot access my account page from over a minute. This is making my experience worse. I am trying since morning! Team please make interface easy."
"It used to be a good app, but now it has become pathetic in terms of loading speed and ux. Accessing pages like wishlist and order info was better before, but the recent update has just messed up with these basic functionalities. And the app takes ages to load!! So annoying! I used to only shop from flipkart previously, but now I find myself using this app the least. What hppnd to you flipkart? Why such bad user experience, bad app design, bad customer care, & bad resolution of grievances now?"
"Reducing the rating from a 5 star to 3 stars. The app has become very slow. It takes ages to load one page. User interface needs some work. It was very convenient to use earlier, after updates it is becoming worse."
"Very poor interface earlier version was much better , flipkart changed the return very complicated so better buy from store donot buy anything from flipkart they will not takes return worst service"
Plz revert your new Flipkart app design as this new interface is very dull and not user-friendly. Hope you done this soon...
Why fix something that wasn't broken? Messed up big time with the new interface.
Poor...the app is too laggy..new interface is poor and does not even work properly.
App does not working properly when I tap any option or product there are something error to view . This app User interface is not user-friendly pls improve it this time is very lagging.improve your app service.
App does not work properly after new update interface
This app now became a garbage app.It takes a lot of time to load the page and other interfaces compared to previous version was much better. User Interface became so poor.
Worst interface
Smooth interface but sometimes it lags out of nowhere..
"There is some issue with the interface when you clik nothing happens the app is updated and cache are cleared, closed the app tried to click on offers on the interface not working"
User interface has changed and working really bad. I have updated the app but still not changed.
"I don't what's wrong with the app. As it's one among the biggest shopping app, I really didn't expect this lowest level interface. When I tried to browse product it repeatedly showing the same one so when I sort it stopped showing after 100-200 products. If I couldn't see the entire product how could I buy...!??? I even tried to filter that's even worst than normal sort. Please sort out these issues to increase your customer as this annoys many I even checked with many of my friends."
Love it. Very easy interface. Very easy procedure to order your product. Much easier than amazon. com. No fault or disappointment till now.
The new update has lowered the flipkart easy to use interface standard. It has become laggy and confusing.
"Updated interface is pathetic, please change it"
With the new update the user interface has become pathetic.
"New updated interface is irritating to operate , previous one was much batter . Try to make it simple and user friendly not complex and rigid ."
Best user interface and better than amazon
I am experiencing a very bad user experience in flipkart mobile lately if I try purchasing anything then it will throw an error unable to connect to servers even though my network connection is good and today to make the payment from my icici card it was showing me continuously error of unable to connect to servers after several attempta the payment went through. Please check this.not sure how such a app where everyone uses in day to day life is not working properly. Everytime it shows blankpage
very poor interface buttons not working many times pls give old version
"Well designed app... easy to access products... headache free shopping experience... after 05/2022 update, new interface is not working properly..."
"This is very disappointing. I ordered a product and checked the delivery update. After a few days, they extended the date for delivery. 20 days after the order, a sms pops up on my phone that your order has been cancelled by Flipkart. Furthermore, the new user interface is terrible in every way."
"My experience with Flipkart has been very good since I've started shopping from it. The interface and ease of accessing is fantastic. App runs smooth and on top of that the supercoins are also quite easy to utilise. And the best part is that Flipkart is trustworthy, I get the refunds before the given time and return/exchange process is exceptional. :)"
"What have you done with your app interface, i tried to open accounts tab but still it remains on home page.. Worst update ever...."
App interface kya cartoon banaa Diya hai akdom bakwas 🤢
"It had a very user friendly interface earlier, but with latest update the app sucks. Categories are not accessible easily and the icons on top are useless and confusing."
Flipkart is good but user experience is very bad. Flipkart is not working.no product is selecting.after login system showing logout.so that I use website.
After update the apps user interface is sluggish and unresponsive. It was good earlier.
Best user interface
"The user interface is very bad in this updated version please change it, we are facing a lot of problems"
excellent interface
Worst customer interface ever They blocked my chat box without notice Go with Amazon better place for customers grievance
New interface of the app not good also app doesn't work fine plz update.
App is taking too long to respond and totally unresponsive sometimes had a very bad user experience
"The Recent updates sucks, Thought my phone had a touch problem, Later realised, the app is not responding properly. Unable to filter, unable open the product, just up & down scrolling working. What is the use of it? I live in one of the metro city, and there is no Delivery available. Strange.. The new interface, were handling by todlers or something?"
Pathetic experience with the app after the update. New interface looks sluggish and lacks speed. All new looks are deceptive in this update.
Beeter than Amazone. Nice user friendly interface
Totally bad user interface from last update thy need to fix it up.....
"New App interface sucks big time. Leave something alone; avoid attempting to correct, fix, or improve what is already sufficient. The previous one was smooth one but current one has lot of bugs"
"New updated app so worst, so poor, so bad, it is hang all the time and disturb all the settings. I don't like it's new interface, previous version was good and easy to use."
Very good interface....
Dear #walmaet earlier when It was indian brand it was worthy I have a list of unhealthy incidents since 2019 the app is getting worst day by day. I with my different accounts had shoped a lot and had a worst interface with your costumer supervisor or support . I would like to suggest that if you want to be alive in this field then please improve your customer support. Worst experience with your chat bot on aap and on messenger and everywhere. Shame on you #walmart #flipkart.
"Really fed up with the new updated flipkart app. Too much loading time, too much failed transaction, worst user interface. I really wonder, y flipkart wants to decrease its no of customers ??"
Woreset interface before update it was nice place give old version
Whats wrong with this app? Interface doesn't showing single picture ...😐
Interface not working worst app disappointed
The updated version of your app interface designed very bad. Feels like somethings missing from older verions. Very bad experience
excellent interface
After updating new interface app is hanging and interface is not user friendly..fix it & please back it with earlier app interface...this one sucks🤮
Recent interface is horrible & loading page taking more time
Buggy interface
Lots of user interface problems. Something went wrong is frequently happening
It's not opening.. It needs a good interface.
Third class interface.....
too good..... user fRiendly app inteRface
Why You Were Keep Changing Interface new one is totally bad and lagging
good interface. good service.
"very clear interface, compartable options..."
"Why you guys are playing with user interface After update I am searching settings option, wishlist option Please provide three dots back. Three dots are user friendly."
Bogus ui after update..not able to see my orders/wishlist tabs..change the interface asap
Worst User interface
New version of Flipkart app is useless. It's very difficult to operate the app. At the home page cart is gone wishlist is gone and I'm not able to find where is my order option all gone is very difficult to find settings profile old one wash very good but this interface is useless. Earlier I give 5 start rating now I want to give 0 but zero option is not there. Once again useless.
"Delivery not on time even after showing out for delivery. My last 2 order for return were not picked up on time and lastly it ended up with no retun . And the customer support system is pathetic, no live chat. Improve your USER EXPERIENCE"
The new interface sucks and annoying the old interface is much better and user friendly .. Dear Flipkart team please do something and bring back old interface !
I think flipkart should introduce older user interface again
"Very poor interface in the new update. It always asking me to sign-in for everytime I open the app, it's very disgusting to login everytime."
This new interface is just rubbish I hate it!! It's really confusing Please give the old interface back
Good one. But User interface not good in latest June version
"Its a good app once,bt now it's the new look or what I don't know..bt the it's hard to get the bar of my orders,my account ..I mean during the old interface it has a ""3 bar"" button and It's easy to get the site..bt now You need to hold at the side of your screen than it shows that chart of home. ita annoying"
"Worst update ever,app interface id disgusting"
Why did you change the app interface it's bad change back to what it used to be.
New app interface is very bad...
Very bad interface after updation.... Where is wish list???
The whole interface zooms on its own. And new UI is simply waste.
The recent update has made it look like a cheap app. They have worked hard to make sure that people find it hard to contact customer care and this will enable them to save money by hiring less backend staff. The UI that I loved has been changed to a ugly looking interface. Regressive thinking from developer. Forgot to mention that even email ids for customer care are not working now.
"Very bad experience ,,,, too laggy too slow compared to other apps ,,,, common walmart didn't expect this from uuu ,,,, before interface was good but now its horrible"
"Worst app, they takes months to deliver the product. No proper customer support. I'm waiting for more than two months for the products ordered. Bad interface. They don't even deserve 1 star. I don't understand why they take so many days to deliver the product, while other apps are able to deliver with in a day. Worst experience ever."
Updated interface is really poor. Uncomfortable to navigate in the app
The recent update stirs things up for me The UI is very difficult to use .. can't figure out how to go back to home page without backing .. idk what r they doing .. the interface is vry bad now
"The Customer care does not respond, and they until date did not refund my money for Voltas AC order cancelled. There is no email address and they don't respond through app interface. In chat box also bot alone is writing. And Grievance to senior also fails. I am going to complain to consumer court and legal actions on flipkart within few days if they don't refund. I advise all stop shopping on flipkart and use amazon which is quick AnD fast for consumer complains."
"This is the worst update ever. Specially those tabs like game,photo,offer zone they must be somewhere inside of the some option but it right on the top. And things like categories we need direct interface but at this time we need to go category sect. Then select Pls don't place these categories inside any option separate it."
user friendly interface
Worst user experience with flipkart. Bought a fault phone now I'm feeling why I bought this. Not even able to return. Please don't buy in flipkart. Then you'll waste your money.
"Recent update made the user interface very difficult to navigate, soon deleting Flipkart. Thank you."
"New update of this app is very not user-friendly interface is not good , taking so much time to do any task ,not able to pay my emi . This is pathetic condition of the application . We need to switch to different shoping ap"
In the new interface of Flipkart it is very difficult to search for products
"Hi Flipkart, The BOT application/chat system is miserably slow, worst interface. I have requested multiple times for a call back but it seems no action from your end .. Have placed multiple orders and expected to receive delivery way beyond estimated time limit. Similar issues were faced last time. It seems amazon is way better than your pathetic app. Reviews from a frustrated Flipkart user. I did not find option to mark this app to zero ratings, hence making it to 1 star"
"Why u PPL make d user experience worse instead of making it simpler..it was very simple n fast earlier,but it has lost it charm.."
Lol Flipkart is broken 😂 Idk what happened to the User interface but it's not same as before anymore. Feels wired didn't expect this to happen
Am using from long time but Updated interface looks very old and dull Not attractive. So go back to the previous layout and do some changes.
"Ghatiya app😡 Payment page was not loading since morning as I was in need of urgent blender for home, Unfortunately had to order from amazon at last, which has better interface and low price compare to your app"
great user experience easy to use straightforward
07/08/2019 Flipkart is the Amazon of India 😊👍 Best online shopping experience from the day they started to do business. User experience is superb. Kudus to Flipkart ❤️ 07/06/2022 Flipkart is still good for electronics. But Amazon has taken over its number one spot. Flipkart is always reliable than most of the Amazon sellers but it's range is very less compared to Amazon. But still Flipkart is the best when it comes to electronics. Keep it up.
"The user experience is horrible. This used to be one of the best apps out there. Way better than other shopping apps. Now it's one of the worst apps I've ever used. You have taken a great app and completely broken it. It's extremely laggy. It's like using a web browser on a dial up connection. I have to force shut the app down multiple times and reopen it to complete what I'm trying to do. Frankly, I find myself using other apps more and buying things off of them. It's a pain to use."
"Worst user interface after update, looks like Chinese shopping application with so much color . Page failing to load frequently."
Previous Version interface is much better.
Worst user interface now
User interface is pathetic
WTH is this UI interfaces.... Where ismy order details?
"It was good earlier but from few days there are so many bugs in the app, no account details, no order details, now it is difficult to use, the worst app interface ever seen."
New interface is very bad. Very difficult to see my order as swipe action is for both back and see order.
"Since the Interface was upgraded there are multiple issues with this app from displaying offers, invoice etc. One the world's largest Ecom site should get this resolved ASAP I am experiencing this issue for the last few months."
"Editing my feedback based upon the most recent experience. Why is your team hell bent on making the app interface pathetic. I woke up today morning to find a whole new look.... But while innovating the app, the developers forgot to add many vitals such as my account, orders, wishlist etc. Please switch back to the original interface.... We love flipkart due to its old age original interface. Please do not experiment."
New update not good user interface as can't find categories and cart easily
Interface page very bad. Neither is the app running. There are many bugs. Irritating instead of shopping.
"The latest update changed the ui and is not user friendly. Whoever come with this new design don't know a thing about e-commerce consumer behavior and designed the app with pathetic user experience. The wishlist or my orders sections are the most used sections in an e-commerce app and I cannot find those anywhere in the app. Just a message to the designer, design is not just about making the ui better to the eyes. It is more than that."
Worst interface
Now the interface is looking soo cheap and ugly We want old interface of flipkart
Hey please change your recent homepage interface to previous one... Current interface is very bad we need to roaming whole app for just open Order section... Plz change it
Services and application interface better than Amazon but still worst experience with there support team. They just pretend to call back by providing missed calls and disconnecting the call in between. No other way to connect with them. Nevertheless thankyou for your services.
User interface and User experience of flipkart is very good.
"After update , the interface of app so cheap. Previous version was good one."
Recently bought the Nokia TV 65 inche has a no screw threading on TV tech instalation team came after 1 week and again the tech visited me after a week still my package is laying down home raised number of tickets bought many products from Flipkart and this was the worst experience I'm into now and in app interface i can't switch my account after the update ...
App is very slow....always buffering. Interface is also very awkward and complicated.
User interface is very bad after the update.
Flipkart is a bigger shopping aap. It's new update and interface is hard to use. Please make easier and simple to use. It shopping filter is not working. If add filter price below 1000 or 2000 it never shows. I am giving it 3 star. In aap a product shows price Rs. 2999 if you click on it it turns higher than 2999.
flipkart app User Interface is best.
I am Soo harrased from flipkart. I didn't expect this type of fraud interface. I have returned product before a montha ago but still I don't received refund my payment. I have too much complained to flipkart but they you will refund shortly now going month but no refund. It's totally fraud scam with me.😡😡
New app has hectic interface & the chat facility to connect with cc exe is just fudge by Flipkart to run away from complaints
This app has many problems. Different phones shows different interface
"Worst Interface and has got lot of bugs. Unable to add items to cart. Displays error 500. I don't know what it is. It seems the sort and filter options fail to satisfy not only me but even my friends re-iterated the same. App has become worser than it was earlier. Now I know why people prefer Amazon, as user interface is user friendly and it frequently doesn't change the UI which flipkart does. Please give a better UI."
well I can say the interface of the app is good and you are giving good discount also but can you add useful info on the product upon seeing the review given by customer
Your catalogs don't open. Keeps rotating. Guess all internal links to catalogs are broken. I wait for 30 secs to open 1 catalog item specially during sale. Such pathetic user experience. Don't u guys test for number of users. Is that so much less scalable ?
"They gave me the Worst user experience. There delivery boy took out item from the order which i ordered in sale and when i said to return he said that if you will not take it, i will deliver it to my self. What a rubbish . Also i paid for the order in advance but when i get the order till then the order payment was in proccesing and i have to repay for the order . No one replying and no option for direct call, even meesho is better than them."
This application is the interface is not good I think old one is better and your delivery death not maintenance proper date why👎👎👎👎👎
Very poor interface too much lagging very disappointed
App was great but now it's very slow and I don't think it's a good user interface. They just ruined the app
"I have been using this app since 2016 and i felt easy to use its interface than other shoping apps, but recently after update it seems little overwhelming."
even tho I use filter out of stocks items will be shown that's a bad user interface
Disgusting interface
Recent update change the interface this is very cheap previous interface is batter you should change the interface...and we want previous interface
"WORST UPDATE, INTERFACE UI CHANGES ARE VERY DISGUSTING"
Bring back the old user interface please.
Not happy with interface
"This app has gotten worse after the new update, doesn't even load the content whenever I open the app it keeps showing a blank screen even when I have good internet connectivity, keeps loading forever, fix this issue asap, for those who haven't updated the app yet, please don't, it'll just ruin your user experience"
user interface is too complex.need to improvised
Current interface of this app is so low level. Takes too much time for loading content which was very quick earlier
"No sale and discounts at all , total rubbish and wastage of time . don't try to make people fool 😡. Actually instead of giving time in advertisements and promotion you should try to make the app more easy to interface ."
Bad interface
"New interface gives very cheap look, Remove similar products from the top, or give settings to enable disable it."
Well its actually good and interface is nice....but the problem is it takes to much time to load....like when we open the app it just only shows white screen...same while Searching.... Takes too much time to load... Other shopping apps are very quick!!!!
Team flipkart please lay Stress on developing the application. The interface looks very cheap.
Old user interface was good and that was easy to use. I don't like new one
nonsense user interface after update
Bring back the older interface
Poor User interface Not responding despite having good internet connection
Interface is bad after update
updates are supposed to improve the working of the app and user experience and flipkart did the exact opposite..... before few updates flipkart app seemed organised and easy to use and after update it become💩💩💩💩
Decreased level of service and user experiences
User interface is far better then the rival applications. Good application.
App interface is good but service is going worst ... They will not deliver in rural area or even on highway if that location is away from city.
Not user-friendly...very bad experience using interface
"I think this site has been taken over by a rival company. Earlier it was the best interface out of all online buying sites, but i think now they are aiming for the worst."
"Previous update had better interface than this, need to think again Flipkart."
"After recent updates application comes with worst UI (user interface) ,very buggy application . And i have recently ordered Steelbird SBH helmet being a plus customer I had worst experience and this would be my last order on Flipkart...."
app interface does not show price of goods
"How happy it makes me to realize everyday that i have an app that genuinely gives the best shopping experience one could get. You name it, they literally offer a 10/10 experience in everything, be it returns , refunds, delivery cancellation , pay later , app interface and customer support handles. I have never worried about my money being stuck or product going missing or any of those things. I started shopping on flipkart back in 2011 and since then they have made sure i only get the best."
"With new update, app is not user friendly. User interface team have to work on it."
Have been using this app since last year but this update is💩. Your signifiers are at your worst level. Not at all a user friendly interface. Things like my orders are difficult to find.
Worst user interface
Worst user interface. Most of the catogeries are not showing. Everytime needs to open my account section to view order
Degrading User Experience Why would you add irritating voice guide at each step ?? I know what to do on the app.
I didn't like the new interface it's has Maken things more complicated. Previous one was gem .
nowadays getting app update daily its very annoying and after update the interface of the app is not good sometimes apps crash.
The current interface is to bad.please remove that grocery section from the front page it dosen't suit.
We want our old UI interface or you have to improve this UI very much.after update very much bugs and glitches are there...
Day by day delivery service of flipkart is getting worse .No proper info is provided about our order . Being a flipkart plus member ur are deliberately given order late for free delivery. Worst ever experience. No proper dashboard unfriendly user interface. Irritating chat boot service which gives you response after hours 🙄
Worst user interface..not at all user friendly.. i don't suggest anyone to go for Flipkart..it is very disgusting that product gets delayed by 10 days even we can't cancel the order..worst of the worst flipkart
The new interface is rubbish.make hard to use. Previous interface was better. Flipkart should bring back the left slide navigation bar.
The new interface is a nightmare...it's soooo difficult to navigate to the important things like Orders or Wishlist....and Reaching a customer support rep is Like Fighting a War....WORST service from FLIPKART
best delivery app... interface is easy as compared to other applications...
Bad interface
"It used to be very good but it's cheap nowdays . Very bad no customer care ,bad interface and now it's charging for cash on delivery"
worst interface !
Very easy to use and fetching interface.Till date flawless experience.And last but not least genuine products are available.
Very very bad platform and the user experience that they provide. No one has no clue in Flipkart on what's happening. Customer service is of zero help.
"Earlier interface had categories option at the top so it was very easy to navigate. Now we have to slide to option at Right, then click on categories, then we get access to options of all categories so then we click to mobiles, fashion, electronics, appliances etc. Please give these options on top when we start the application as it was earlier."
"With the latest update this App User interface is worst...I am unable to login through mobile app, as it automatically gets logout immediately..I am able to do shopping only through, online website...For the latest Flipkart app i want to give -5/5 rating.."
This is the worst app ever flipkart is the biggest scam I had ordered two pairs of shoes and only one was delivered while the charged me for both shoes now they have rejected refund and customer care and the user interface of this app is the worst zero support and reliability
Prices are always high than Amazon and poor interface app. NO homepage icon to switch back. Lossing its focus in Market
New Flipkart app is bogus.... Please revert to previous interface.
Cheap interface after update...🤮
nice interface
User Experience is Really Bad 😑..
FRONT END OF FLIPKART NEED TO BE IMPROVED. USER EXPERIENCE REGARDING THE VEIWEING IS NOT THAT GREAT COMPARING WITH OTHER COMPETITIORS. EKART IS DOING GOOD THEIR DELIVERY AND SERVICE IS TOP NOTCH
"The main problem is i think they have the worst, THE WORST, customer service ever.. i never seen this much worst service even in small e commerce sites..they just didn't fix my problem, skipped my topic and just gone without any reply or anything.. i tried to contact three times and still this is the result.. I'm very much dissapointed.. the end user experience is very dissapointing to me. I think that's why Amazon is far far more better than this.. i know this issue will never fix in Flipkart."
"Flipkar is now excellent. 2 years before flipkart not much interactive, but now fipkart is change. They change interface, that is really good to understand easily. They improve everything in their service like delivery timing, return pick up timing evrything is fast. Super coins also one good option for customers. Now whenever i need anything i just use flipkart except of Amazon."
best interface
Amazing interface as compare to other apps
The user interface is getting more complicated day by day. I want to go to my order delivery status straight from home page . They should work to make the experiance simple and not only aesthetically pleasing.
Good user interface as compared to Amazon.
After latest update i m not able to shop all interface changed last 2year i purchased around 1lac good but since last three . Month 0 cause seach not being easy i switched to amazon
The new interface is not good... Flipkart is not delivering product in arunachal (792103) pin why?
"Compaired with amazon interface flipkart is really behind in app interface and product category ,prices are also high in flipkart and grocery now"
"Very Bad User Interface After New Updates From Last 2-3 Months, Old App User Interface Was Clean, Easy To Find Things, But After Grocery Portion And Suggestions Ads, You Are Making This App Bad Like Never Before"
"Too bad User experience, No Support assistant ( call help person ), just a useless Bot. Always showing processing payment infact that it successfully from client side. Have to think hard before using Flipkart or ordering from it. I don't what the developers are doing if not looking into some serious reviewes."
products purchased and delivery service or the customer care service experience is really good. But the app interface and user experience has gone to garbage. I cant even stay logged in to my account neither was i able to place order on the app. I had to log in on the website to order or even browse through the website. Pathetic App
The best online shopping app no doubt even i given 5 star now i decrease it because the interface or app totly changed and it was so difficult and lag my experience to xplore flipcrt.we want 3 line for batter experience.
"These days dont know what happened to flipkart they are providing one of the worst service both from customer service end & mobile app interface.I used to order almost everything from flipkart but in recent times every product i try to order shows not deliverable,it happened many times and now iam receiving different products from what i have ordered customer support and refunds are the most worst.Dont know which issue to explain because every single thing has an issue from flipkart."
Worst app interface pathetic customer service. Item mentioned on website or app is completely different from items delivered.
Worst experience on flipcart after recent update. Flipcart interface before update is like a first class shopping app but now onwards it looks like a street beggar's app.
Update: improved!! Lags a lot! Bad user experience
"Flipkart has some serious online payment interface issue. Money gets debited from account and the transaction fails. Usually, in such cases you will receive the refund afterwards but it doesn't happen in flipkart. Even the customer support couldn't help you. Hence I would discourage the usage of pre-paying in flipkart."
I am using Flipkart from 6 years And it's easy to use application and also UI. This update its a best update because font size is great and also some Users interface aslo great 👍👍
"So late, unreliable and ugly interface."
User Friendly Interface
"Your new interface Sucks. Why did you wipe the entire upper check ins.... making it completely difficult to check orders,wishlist,cart...."
The app comes with updates daily and its user interface is different after some days . We cant pay the emi because that option is not appearing
Best app with user friendly interface
user interface is very good
"Product name: Poco X4 Pro 5g. Hi, reviewing after 3 days of use. I bought this phone and use it for only 3 days and its UI(user interface) got totally crashed, within 72hour of use. And I'm not able to replace it. Because, the person I'm talking for replacement, is saying that ""I can't take the product back"". They don't take any responsibility for their word 'for 7 days of replacement' its fake. It's better to buy phone offline."
please improve your flipkat interface please apdate your system
"Flipkart app is excellent. My experience with Flipkart has been very good that is really good to understand easily. since I've started shopping from it. The interface and ease of accessing is excellent.They improve everything in their service like delivery timing, return pick up timing evrything is fast. Super coins also one good option for customers. Now whenever i need anything i just use flipkart except of Amazon."
Nowadays the app forces me to relogin after every 10-15 min of usage and the interface is becoming too laggy. Fix these asap.
Just change the user interface it is worst than ever . We can find nothing
great shopping app. convenient to use. simple and attractive interface. loved it...y'all will also love it...try it
"Recent interface is very poor, show all item currently unavailable"
"Very worst interface after updating, amounts shown in 2 digit only can't know the full amount before going to give buy button"
Please change the interface.. I don't like this interface.. do that like older version or make some new interface.. this interface is very simple.. look like very cheap quality
Bahut hi kharab service hai flipkart ki . Mai chahta hu ki aap sudhar kare . Old flipkart interface Jada acha tha ye wala bahut hi bekar hai.
"Return option does not show up for the orders which are still valid for return, app is buggy...User experience for app needs to be improved"
"Day by day flipkart is deteriorating it's value when it comes to UI and UX. Today I was trying to return a product which was eligible to return but the ""return"" or ""exchange"" option was not available. Also, it seems they forgot to mention the customer support contact or email anywhere in the app which gave a worst user experience. There are lot many similar issues exists in the app. The""need help"" section also redirecting to a error page.This was not at all expected from a giant like Flipkart."
What the hell is wrong with Flipkart. First it was constantly logging out now my payment interface just keeps buffering with a white page.
"Grocery show nhi kar Rahahe, phale vala interface sahi tha . Q aur apna dimag lag rahahe ho."
It's worste interface is good but delivery boys par company ka dhyan nahi hai i got call from delivery boy at nearly 7 pm but it's 9 pm but he's still not here
Suddenly the flipkart Grocery section is not showing items post the app update last night. No items is displaying on Grocery section to browse. If I manually search for one item then it displays that item only and nothing else. App is laggy and slow. Dear tech team please look into this. User experience of this app has suddenly become intolerable and irritating
best interface ..best trusted app
"This time Very bad interface irritating some product picture is highly edited its not match as compared to actual product so do not product picture edit . shows original actual picture AND flipkart is more delivery charge geted , plz avoid delivery charge actually product total price is 39 rupees and flipkart getting delivary charges 40 rupees😂😂😂"
"easy to buy products. simple interface. quality,i brought of this ..."
Flipkart app has become slow since pandemic started. Its beeen years and flipkart has done nothing about it. I am a regular buyer from flipkart and have no issues deals and products or customer service but user experience of the app must improve a lot.
"simple interface, easy to use"
nice interface👍
Good interface and well managed functions.
very nice 👍 user interface
This is can be easy to use and I like to give four store because I have some works found in the Flipkart servers so Flipkart to get the customer very good interface and very good using
"I'm using Flipkart from last 5 years but never faced any issues but nowadays it's UI issue kindly improve your application, switching from one menu to other menu is very tedious it keeps on buffering, while trying to open any link it doesn't open at once until and unless you have the app open in background. Kindly pay attention on this, this is really hampering the user experience, and we all are facing from over 4 months, i think the update provided by u is useless, if u can't solve the issue."
Recent update look like cheap please return old one look interface mza nhi aara y vala update chlane kaa
"Interface is so horrible. After searching an items, there is no option to go directly to home page. There is a difference in the price of the selected item. Initially, the price of the selected item looks low, but after going into the details, the price becomes high."
"Fed-up with this aap after so many updates still facing problem always I hv to close twice then only it is working, I think Flipkart not focusing on user experience they simply thinking abt their business better going forward I will prefer Amazon."
Flipkart new name bugscart User experience very bad. Too much bugs and service too poor.
Good user interface
"1. App interface is too clustered, the spacing is very badly projected. 2.The overall work for the menu options lacks design flow and seems like a dull prototype. 3.When they want to go back they land to it's previous page not the last product search page they were on. It got it's pros but the cons are more in number. 4.The actual price, discounted price & discount for a product should not be on the same line not with the *or pay this + coins* *It loads a lot, Customer Service option is bad.*"
The new interface is absolutely horrible.
"poor user interface, not user friendly, its total chaos, cant vene understand whats what"
New interface is not at all good
Don't install this one of the worst app in the playstore...worst user interface
"After update it becomes pain, previous interface was very easy and attractive. After update it keeps logging out automatically again and again"
Wrost interface ever seen.
"After Sign In successfully,app Sign Out my account Automatically. Very bad user interface."
Had to improve on Delivery Associate (Speed Delivery). Easy to use but some issues are there in the app. Logged out unexpectedly when we try to see orders. I think had to improve on App User Experience and fix some bugs and come with a good update in future. Last but not least ekart logistics are very pathetic delivery experience Flipkart had to change their courier partner for speed delivery should be on or before expected date. Some logistics issues are there from ekart had to improve on that.
Nice user interface
Very poor interface even after updates in every two three days.. what is there to update in every two three days and still the app interface is pathetic....
There is no assured feature.App interface is also not good .Please tag products as f assured for quality assurance.As i got two orders which are not geuine
Very bad interface and cannot order a product properly. Just try to improve the interface and update it so that we dont face issues.
The customer support interface and customer care number are very frustrating. I'm trying to connect customer care it's says we will get back in 10 mins from agents but agents does not do anything. Worst service.
Worst interface such a nice interface in old version futures
"Useless app with a lot of problems, I don't know what is problem of the app with me it always shows all products are out of stock. Interface problems, loading problem. Ultimately the app is a disaster. I prefer Amazon for shopping."
"the best in all online marketing... I mostly use it .. This app has best user interface.. Displayed menu, icons are very attractive looks ,, free fast delivery,, easy returns,, also awesome features like Pay later...👍👍👍"
Worst user experience. my account is not opening only i am unable to check the status of my order
The app has become worse in terms of user interface..the app runs dead slow at times. Please improve your server accessibility. Edit1 : The app chat or support feature sucks big time. The chat or call for support never gets connected within the Application.
I always prefer flipkart to amazon. they have such a good interface. so user friendly. love it
Recently the app interface have so much buffering and bugs. I used to love this app but constant glitch have made it really irritating. Plz fix the bugs. I really used to love this app
App interface is not friendly
Earlier it has a nice 🙂 interface and the app had a very decent Speed . But after updated it's too much slow. And it's feel very boring while finding the products.
"Absolutely rubish interface. Connection lost while viewing my orders, placing my order even paying for anything. Get that bug fixed."
"Very nice app, very nice interface, very nice products it have, very nice and very much quantities and categories it have, Very happy I'm"
The new interface is not smooth it lags and I am having many bugs like connection failed few times
The app interface is very poor and it is very buggy it refreshes everytime...says no network...its like a headache for me... The recent updates made it more poor!
Old interface was much easy and better. Present one is fancy and difficult.
this new interface is too hard to use please make simple. i cant even find my old orders🙏
Recent update makes the app interface a thumbs down 👎 evenif it's a marketing technique to increase sale in grocery section.
Experience is very bad after the update interface was better .i would give it 0 stars if there was a option for its interface.
The recent interface update is so cheap that will make you frustrated
Nice user interface
"New update of ui is not user friendly old interface is better and new translate customer review , that shows random languages. Worst update"
What happened with its server? The interface is too slow than previous version.. if I am trying to open any shared link of any product it's doesn't opened.. all tym showing error. Why? Please solve this issue
"Please fixed the interface of the app, Old version was good and easy to find everything."
"Ghatiya App Ghatiya Interface ... Or usse bhi jyada ghatiya inki services.. after 7 days of placing order Dizo watch worth 3500rs. Got a duplicate 50-100rs watch. And when I requested for refund or replacement I got date for replacement after 50 days.. .. i received my order on 21 July and replacement date Flipkart gave me 9 September.. Worst service, worst app and worst customer service executive.. they don't even know how to talk to customers."
"Very bad user experience(UX), Earlier with few clicks we used to reach on the item we want. Now it's a nightmare"
This app lags a lot.... Switching between Flipkart and grocery section is not smooth at all lags a hell lot very irritating sometimes and user interface was better before.
Worst customer support... Don't use flipkart and worst application interface.... This application is too bad and not user friendly. Sometimes it doesn't respond
Nice interface and products
Offer ka pata ni chal raha hai old interface sahi tha
Day by day user interface is becoming more familiar
Worst e-commerce portal. Don't have human interface to listen to the customer issues. Irritating BOTs.
"Worst update. Along with all the other problems like hiking prices n bad interface, there is problems with changing the bank details now. Flipcart, please hire someone better n update UI"
"Please change the app UI interface it is very Worst, the menu options are also very worst, please change . App is also loading too much time and it is not responding some times ."
"Worst user interface till now. -Left side sliding menu bar has gone. -Star ratings doesn't show the actual number of rating like 3.9, 4.2, 4.5 etc.. Still not resolved in august. 🤨🤨😤"
"Nowadays, experiencing worst services. App interface not appearing properly, can't contact customer service directly after so many efforts you will get contacted and will not get any resolution till the date they mentioned . Very Disappointing Service. How will you be The Amazon of India???"
Pathetic user interface. There is an option for disclose out of stock options so if an individual has not selected this why are a series of not available product shown in a category ? Not a user friendly app
nice interface and products and services
Interface is better than Amazon.
Okay just need to be look like smooth 60 fps interface without stuttering.
"Worst User Interface. While viewing wishlisted items one by one , if we click on any item and come back after viewing, it will not continue from where we stopped. It again goes back to top. From the beginning need to scroll it again. Please change this. We should be able to start viewing items and continue from where we stopped. Not from the beginning again."
It's a best e commerce app it's really good even best of it is compared to Amazon air other app for me it comes on the top everything is wow in it i am using it since 2018 and it is retained me as a loyal customer Everything is wow It's usee interface sometime due to bugs it's lagging but u will get regular update Customer service wow 😍 Customer support excellent 👌 Offers and discounts delivery 🚚 all is best It deserves 5 star ✨🌠 And at last its a ethical company i have experienced
"18/05/2019: Really ...i always buy anything from flipkart so thanx flipkart for making this for convenient and faster purchase from flipkart app... Edit: this app really changed alot have lot of bugs.. also items priced under 99.. mostly they want us to but minimum 3 or 4 units.. even if we just need only 1.. also some times filter like low to high, etc doesn't work it just remove every filter checks thats frustrating.. they should really improved their user experience.. untill it's too late.."
interface really good. easy to search what you want.
Really Very nice app and User interface. lot better than Amazon
"One of the shittiest app in terms of user experience. A simple task such as updating a mobile number on the account is tedious. The worst registeration system ever built is used in here, It doesn't allow me to update my mobile number on my account as nd Now that I don't have a number on the account i cannot even request a callback."
Unneccesary change in the interface recently making it very user unfriendly. Also lately flipkart has become one of the worst ecommerce site when it comes to customer service. Its a fraud.
"Pathetic user experience. Over committing delivery dates. Over commitment by customer support. Accepting orders that either Flipkart or seller is unable to fulfill. I ordered phone that was to be delivered next day, which didn't happened and the delivery date was changed to subsequent day without any notification. I thought it's ok let's wait for another day. Next day cust support informed seller cancelled the order and to order again. When I orderd again it was again cancelled. Bad experience"
good interface of app
there are a tons of improvements needed in terms of user interface and filters.
"Make the interface like it was before brother, the new interface is very rubbish, so please make it like it used to be opened from the side."
App interface is not good.
"The new app's user experience is horrible. Cannot find any option, can't see order details, can't find account details. If you go to grocery section, there is no way to come back to main app."
"Despite a wave of negative reviews Flipkart is callous about improving their user experience. Well, I have stopped using the app altogether because it only gets worse. The Customer Support experience is 'WORST' and it's a chore to bring out a solution from them, let alone their behaviour and professionalism. Amazon is the best!"
"New update doesn't have a menu option for in left top corner, donot interfere with your interface which was user friendly back then."
New interface is Not user friendly Not easy to get to order details..
New app interface is very bad. Please change to old user interface.
"After every update it sucks, why it starts buffering like 2G era? App is crashing countinously, every time I press back after viewing a product screen gets white for a very long time and nothing shows up. New update has made this app worst ever I am using Flipkart from more than 5 years and this one updtae is worst among them. Work asap on it and improve user interface asap"
After update flipkart app very bad interface order seaction and many more not showing
"The last update of Flipkart app is a very bad user interface, it can be called a total disaster for users"
"After the latest updates, the user interface is completely changed and that is really hard to adapt and easily browse ... Now I don't even feel like opening Flipkart app. So I order everything from Amazon event though price is less in Flipkart.."
very good regarding service and easy to use interface
Mobile aap interface is very unfriendly. Recent changes in android app interface is very confusing. Takes lots of time to load.
Best filters and user interface.
very nice interface
easy to search and good interface
Nice user interface
"As i am using this app after 1year, Now its user interface is very bad. Using this feels very uncomfortable, tracking package and its hard to contact ontact Customer care, refund is taking long time and can't able know the process, products are having many issues."
Good interface
Why each screen showing Something went wrong. This is very bad user experience till date using this application. I'm not anle to Search for any product or not able to go to the category page also.
After new interface its very lagy and always flashing something went wrong
"New update sucks! The main thing that differentiate Flipkart from Amazon was its User Interface, thanks to you guys you just made it worse... Seems like younguys copied it from realme store... Same font colour palette. The app WAS... way better than any other ecommerce platform, Not any more."
Very user friendly compare to others I love this app. User interface are looking very good 👍. I like fast delivery for my location. Delivery person are very friendly.
"Good shopping site, but worst customer care and setting interface. Not able to change mobile number as OTP is sending to lost mobile number. No updation facility through registered email id or current mobile number."
Why you keep updating the interface and this is so bad. I can't even the price for any product on the page unless I process to cart.
"Worst user interface. Nothing works smoothly in the app. Couple of years back, the app was better than that of amazon now it has become useless"
"Today(23/6/22) while placing an order, an interface shows to add some insurance policy worth about Rs.200 extra with the item's price. As I skip that said policy option, the app automatically exit to my phone's home screen. If it is a bug or glitch of your app, fix this problem to maintain a customer's satisfactory. That is the reason behind my 1 star less rating against the maximum."
"Abhi wala interface maja nhi aa rha , plz ho sake to change kare, phle wala hi sahi tha"
completely ruined the interface of mobile application. Now it's looking like fake local app...
"The old UI was good, new UI is worst, and it has very bad user experience"
Good interface
i like the simple and easy interface
Every product in flipkart is showing not deliverable. If it is not deliverable then why to show in notifications and interface about the products. I was irritated about this
"Super smooth interface, Easy payment options, Pay Later Facility. Just love it."
Changing my review as the new update is not user-friendly. I personally know many people who used Flipkart over any other applications due to its user-friendly interface
Worst app interface very irritating while using it ... Once I got the product delivered in time But from few months even my single product delivered in expected delivery time... Iam ordering 4 products from 2months Even now didn't got the product Always showing DELAY in delivery After next two or five days they are cancelling the order... I have contacted customer care service many times they are always suggesting me to order again... With patience I ordered 3 times Worst service a
user friendly interface for shopping
User friendly interface and genuine products
"When I search for a product i see more of the currently unavailable or not deliverable products rather than seeing products i can buy, your loss Flipkart, the interface is good this is the only problem i face, can Flipkart pls resolve this issue and respond to me here"
Bad interface.. change it..
The best shopping app ever and osm interface easy to use love it 😍
The new user interface sucks
Worst delivery ever and user interface showing deliverable on PIN but didn't deliver
easy interface
good user interface
"This app has become slow since they changed their interface. Also, while I click on rewards, a white screen appears."
Older version is much better than this Update brings new interfaces with new kind of Bugs and lags not as user friendly as previous versions app must be optimize properly
Wrost user experience ever 👎
best buying platform. The interface of the app is nice. It will be helping for buying best products.
The problem that iam facing is now fixed and by the way nice interface
App interface is awesome
"APPLICATION IS NOT WORKING,APP INTERFACE ALSO WORST AND SLOW"
This is more buggy than MIUI 12 . It has very bad user experience and has a lot of bugs. 😶‍🌫️
Very good interface. Now.
Very bad user interface not only this customers support is also pathetic. Facing issue related missing product from order. Will think twice using this platform again
After new interface app is working slowly and sometimes not opening Flipkart fix it
"Supercoins are Super Useless, Amazon is Much Better with Pay balance. Automatically logging out from the account in a few seconds after the update. Day by day with new updates, it getting worse. not a single thing working properly. Don't play with customers user experience."
User interface is good. But app is absolutely slow. Suppose u search a product the moment when you turn back it takes around 1 min to refresh the page. It need lot of development for making this app user friendly.
App interface is worst always loading and loading even on 1mb/s speed.😡
After years I don't like the interface. People get lost inside your app. Category inside category makes forget people where they are.
"Very bad interface. Most of the time it shows error page, no matter what you search. This app has degraded from its previous version."
Poor interface....unable to get a response on why the order was cancelled...trying to connect with someone is such a challenge !
User interface going down 🤏
"poor interface, doesn't load the page, error everytime"
Most convenient app and it's interface.
User interface 👎
"It is very very irritating to have New updates every day .....and Changed user interface everyday .... Don't you have a review team .. Why you guys new user interface every 1-2 days , even before customer could get used to the previous one . One day there is grocery option the next day it's gone . The following day there is brand mall option , the next day grocery option is back ...."
What type of big billion days update is this. Category menu is drastically of poor interface.
best among all the other shopping apps.. user interface is very easy to use.
good interface and easy to order. Nice product
"this App has the worst f-ing in-app experience. right now, minutes ago i was playing games to earn supercoins and all of a sudden instead of deducting 20 supercoins, it deducted 60 and i couldn't even my chance that i was playing 20 for, and the worst f-ing part is that it doesn't provide any support for that, and also for orders it has been a f-ing hell in customer support. Flipkart has just worsened over the years, and also this new app interface keeps creating so please f-ing fix that shi*."
excellent user Experience very easy..👌🏻👌🏻
Version 7.52 = Best User Interface and Best User Experience ❤️✨
Wrost interface so unstall flipkart app
"Now I changed my review..this is the India's most popular online shopping application. But it's time to some development, team flipkart look your interface,is this looking a good quality application? Please do work in your application. We are expecting a better flipkart."
"Excellent interface, as a service had no problems till now."
The new user interface of app is not good.
Interface sems to be difficult to find quick category. I suggest add 3 in one page ie..Flipkart Grocery and Quick
My user experience is worst Amazon is the best please check order seller has been cancelled my all order
Such a horrible user experience. Anything I click in the app I always end up seeing loading spinner. Scale up the infra and make user interactions faster otherwise there's no way we are going to hang out longer on the app. Poor user experience make the rendering faster.
New interface worst.
Worst customer service & user experience I've ever seen.
"So ghatiya app... anything u click, app says ""something went wrong""... technical pe kharcha kiye nahi kyaa...tired of glitches.... buffering always welcomes u whenever u enter the interface...thik Karo bhai... 1 star de raha huun....aapas mein baant Lena..."
DEVELOPER DESTROYED UI (USER INTERFACE) BECAME WORST THAN AMAZON PLEASE BRING BACK OLD INTERFACE
"mobile interface looks far better than website, smooth like fluid ☺️"
having issues with app to search new interface and order
"Great UI and interfaces, simple process. loved the digital way of shopping. 🌿🖤"
"After update, service is very much worst. App is not working properly. Repeatedly update interface, again and again. Pay later is disabled without any issues."
"Useless app, they are just making fool to all users. User interface also veey bad. Terms and conditions are not obeyed themselves. I really don't recommend this app. Go for amazon."
I LOVE THE INTERFACE ON THIS APP. IT IS TOOO EASY TO USE IT. I NEED A HELP : I WANT CHANGA MY REGISTERED PHONE NUMBER
"App is not opening properly, sometimes I open order tab it's not opening , the app is not responding well interface is also not good like previously."
"Something went wrong on app launch everyday and i have to refresh the app to see see the contents... phew, what a user experience."
I ordered a product and payed through online after 1hr I was cancelled the order but refund is not credited to my bank account and there is no refund status in app interface I never thought Flipkart will do like this
The last update has made this app pathetic.It takes so much time to open the app.it gets stuck on a white interface till the time you get bored and close and move on to another app. Its taking centuries for searching a product and showing. I have been a regular user of this app and this frustates. Why the app doesn't work all of sudeen
"I'm using since 2015 but the latest interface, look like Amazon worst interface, why are you changing like Amazon, this worst I don't like it."
need to make the interface more user friendly
Worst user experience ever. The whole app is lagging from few week 😡
Not good interface
After this new update complete interface of this Application is even worst now.. It's now getting difficult to use..Get us the old one itself..We don't need sperate brand mall like that..Just try to keep the interface simple.Such that everyone could use the application efficiently
User friendly interface and product are available at good prices and at brilliant prices in Big Billion days.
Worst interface. They never fix their website. Lost good deals just because Flipkart couldn't accept online payment. Money gets debited but doesn't reach the merchant. Such a big company yet a buggy interface.
Excellent Interface Good & easy to use Good delivery time & partners. Tarif pe tarif kaam hai.
user interface very simple and easy😀
"Had to change the review now - the app currently only shows error in every other step. I have been using Flipkart over a decade now, but day by day it's performance only keeps degrading. It only keeps showing something or the other error and lags like hell. Previouys review: Shopper friendly app! The interface is very helpful which provides all information. The best shopping experience - it allows hassle free returns."
the fact that the app interface is way better than other e-commerce giant is really impressive......and deals are also really good
Nice app with so many spectacular options of fashion and other utility items. Smooth transaction and easy to use interface helps us finding the best products with appropriate pricing and customer service 🐕‍🦺
Good interface to use
very easy interface. simple buying app.. anyone give order on this amazing app. i like it.
love this app and interface best discount on every product.
nice interface
"easy interface, easy payment, great app overall"
Was nice on line app..but In 2024 new version is very third class. interface is third class . किस जाहिल ने इसका इंटरफेस बदल के इतना घटिया बनाया हे
Good user experience
now a days i am liking its new interface
User friendly interface. easy returns. exclusive offers for plus users. regular discounts on grocery and timely delivery. Flipkart coins can be used to buy subscriptions also for free.
"Ugly User experience, buffering ,loading and unable to view any product except the launching sale screens ! Also,another treachery is that the price of many products is higher for PLUS customers"
User friendly interface and good customer care service.
"Its pathetic. It's seems they are pushing the new interface without proper testing. Sometimes they'll split the flipkart and grocery section options vertically and sometimes horizontally they have added toggle button for grocery and brand mall but again they won't work smoothly, it will sometimes automatically stop the app as well. All this glitches making the app unstable and difficult to use."
App is not user friendly getting more and more complicate and interface is also not good. I am using this application for more than 5 years but this is the worst .
improve user interface
"This app has a very good quality stuffs and overall it's best, but when it comes to app interface it sticks 🥴😬🤮"
"Genuine product,good interface in comparison to amazon"
Best online shoping app not only in india but in the whole world ... So many outstanding and mind blowing feature .. Easy to use.. So amazing interface.. So many features .. So many products to choose from ... Branded product at cheap rate .. It is an amazing amazing app with supercool features
nice place to shop. lot of options comfortable to access user friendly interface
The delivery of the flipkart is the worst. Every time it takes too much time to get delivered and many a times I have doubt in the quality of the products. Even Amazon delivers fast in taluka than flipkart in Metro city. Agreed that the interface is better that of flipkart but all in vain if the service is not upto the point!!!!! Connecting to customer service and getting a call support Easily is another tough task!!
"Nice,.. products are good and dilevery on time...!! interface is easy to use thumbs up for that 👍🏽"
Am going to uninstall the app I ordered one audio interface the price was around 10k but i got one small box. It's worst experience with delivery better to don't waste your time in this.
great interface.....
nice interface nd experience
simple interface and robust search results
Very good E commerce site and Good user experience
Its totally time consuming app.... Whenever we want to search it show unuseful stuff.very slow to open interface ....
good service and App Interface.
"Editing my review, app becoming worse day by day.. dont even load the page. evry time i have to reopen the app still issue remains same. cant even connect with customer support on chat.. worst user interface. Evey time it shows items not deliverable at location to every product i search for even if i change location. Disappointed ....."
"Worst user experience,items are not delivering properly,items are changing (i order something they deliver another)"
"I really liked the user interface of Flipkart. it's very easy and comfortable to move across the required goods or groceries, any person want to buy. Another side the discount and the way of providing support by customer care, is also remarkable."
Difficult interface compare to Amazon... also high prices for products than other such apps... not recommended
User interface is low and mobile will stuck while playing games worst shopping app I have ever seen😡🥵👺
"Idk how to explain this app has lot of bugs For starters I want to add some items to cart but shows me that no Seller ships to this location Similarly the app always changing it interface everytime and these are some bugs, that are missing up user experience 😕"
Now The Flipkart Interface Was Superb
Very bad user experience till now always got the order cancelled without any reason if u can't gave delivery of products on which users order through offer then why you run a such kind of offers to waste our time to spoof us always and always.
"Believe me this was my initial perception about Flipkart - ""Great deals, intuitive user experience and lightning fast service delivery. Keep up the good work."" But in current times, it is managed by group of illiterate people who do not have common sense, to understand a customers concern. Lost my faith."
"Please update app interface, it is making me not to use app"
please give direct home icon from all page ... in flipkart app interface ...no directly home page avalible ...to much irritating to go back all the time ..it should be fix by flipkart ....amazon and all other e-commerce app has this feature
Lag interface
"The new update has made the app the worst app in the market , no interface opens even with a high speed data ."
"Worst application right now and day by day it's going to more worst. Very slow browsing it's take so much time to open, close and back to products. Please improve the user interface quality like browsing."
super smooth user interface
Very bed experience of shopping. Please add a seller block bottom for the scammers who send wrong products or less products .Flipkart showing in interface Combo offer but coming one item. Showing 50%off I am ordering this product but 2 day later automatically cancelled the order.
"To be honest, very poor interface. Unable to find my ordered items at a consistent place. Interface is full of unnecessary suggestions. Please! Please! For your own business sake, improve this extremely poor interface. At least learn something from your rivals like Amazon app."
very fast delivery and very easy app interface
App interface and menu options need to be more user friendly and intuitive.
easy helpfull interface
"I really liked the user interface of flipkart.is every easy and comfortable to move across tha required goods or groceries ,any parsan went to buy .another side tha discount and tha wey of providing saportby castmar car is also remarkable."
Easy to use and interface is good
"some time show ""Retry"" when search or back to previous page.. it's a bug please resolve otherwise good app and smooth interface..."
Very bad using interface Unable to search many options like....how add new debit card
Its like a friend while shopping...cool user interface....
Doing fraud in the name of billion day. Scammer sellers. Cancells orders by themselves. Worst user experience. Amazon is better never buying anything from this fraudsters.
The best designed user interface of all time
"Pathic user experience, and annoying sound during use"
"awesome experience, great discounts and easy user interface for apply coupons and lots of easy payment options."
App is getting worse day by day the user experience is very very bad things doesn't load not able to navigate or prace UPI order properly homescreen doesn't launch most of the times when the app is opened please make it better like it was before please 🥺
amazing shopping interface
Where is the quick delivery option which was introduced in older versions..even ap interface also very laggy..
App not working properly after the update.. The app interface is slow to respond. My account section doesn't load most of the time. kindly fix it.
Intuitive interface and nice service
Excellent user experience with this app. Responsive & fast. Does most of the work required of it. May be an option to reduce/disable the sponsored can be added.
jus love flipkarts user interface
Interface issue
"First time user. ordered today. Excellent interface. Easy to understand n find what I want too. To be honest , the payment that i was made was fast n smooth which I don't find in others ."
"I had been using Flipkart. Since a very long time. I always thought Flipkart has better interface than Amazon. I have been having loading issues from past few months, when I open the app it loads, but if I click on a product and again click back,It doesn't load. Even When you go back it keeps loadng.I have to again exit the app everytime and close it and again click on the app. Sometimes it loads if I wait for three to four minutes but still it's a waste of time. Too much buffering and loading"
Great user interface
"After the update, this app has been the worst user interface..app did not updated itself rather downgraded..guys do some home work for next update."
Extremely poor and pathetic service and interface. It Start cheating and doing Unfair Trade Practice. Customer service is useless and clueless and just read down already written statement. Seller can do whatever they want and Flipkart became mute spectator and allow them to let customer struggle and felt joy after hearing your struggle. I you faced any inconveniences in order then forget about support. Think 1000 times before ordering from Flipkart. Better to order from different companies.
The app user experience is worst. Product page loading time is pathetic. Worast in app experience. It takes forefer to load any product description
Dear devlopers.. Plss update the user interface of the flipkart my orders section... There are lots of problems in it.. At a time it shows a location which is far away from my home and next day suddenly a message came that your order is out for delivery.. What is this? Plss it's a humble request plss fix this problem.. Don't know wheather the developers going to see this or not.. But if any developer seen this then plss fix the issue
app interface built very well
very helpful and friendly interface...............
"Dilevery is not perfect time. Very poor app, it always hangs up and very very slow. All the time it just keep on loading the pages. And always the price. gets change after wishlisting the products and shows a different price at the checkout page. I have been a plus member since 7 years but still facing the same problem. Worst app ever. Amazon interface is not good but atleast it works very well."
interface
Now the interface becomes irritating & & Flipkart is now become fraud company.Now I have shifted from Flipkart to Amazon. Amazon is much better.
"This app is getting worse day by day. User interface is totally waste, otherwise everything is best and improving."
They change everything. The UI the return policy everything is nice before this return policy. They scam us. They said 7 days service center return but after clicking that they show us that only replacement of most of the products on Flipkart except some mobiles and some other houshold things. This is so annoying to the user who is using this app this will ruined the user experience. It's time to shift other e-commerce site.
"Prefer Amazon than this app, since Amazon has better pricing, easy interface, multiple payment options and availability."
"Shopping since last 3 years, very good servicing, just delivery time is too long... But i have seen this company growing from a scratch, earlier amazon was my 1st choise, but now its flipkart. Edit: the user interface got better and the delay is fixed now!!!"
Slow interface
App interface is so easy and interesting
Worst packaging of the ordered products. The products ordered should be packaged opaquely or atleast they should be packaged. NEXT EPISODE I received a single item instead of two items which I ordered. Now I cannot get another item. Flipkart is fooling its customers. Worst ever experience. Also worst user interface to raise concerns over the products ordered
nice user interface and product
The app is really good. The user interface and the whole app experience is really good. But nowadays when i order something it's getting really delayed. I've ordered a product 5 days ago and it's not even shipped yet. It's taking upto 10 to 15 days to deliver a product. Please try to deliver products fast as possible.
New updates are really frustrating and also its interface is getting bad to worst day by day.i loved previous interface of Flipkart app.
Nice interface
"The app is freezing a lot, photos are not opening in review section and user experience of the whole app is very bad. Everyday Flipkart is changing the UI of the app and making it worst day by day."
"This is the best online shopping platform I have ever used, It is easy to use and user friendly interface 😄, Thanks to flipkart!!"
easy to use ...good user experience
"PLEASE DON'T BUY ANYTHING FROM FLIPKART. YOU WILL REGRET IT . Worst app! worst user experience. worst customer service. worst delivery service. worst return policy. YOU CANNOT RETURN ANY DEFECTIVE PRODUCT YOU BOUGHT ON FLIPKART. THEY WILL STRAND YOU UNTIL YOU STOP REQUESTING FOR RETURN. WHY IS'NT THERE AN OPTION FOR ""ZERO STAR""."
Awsome interface
"Very bad user interface, no customer care support, no satisfaction!"
"Easy interface and returns, faster delivery compared to competitors."
User Experience was top notch comparing with other competitors.
"Just An amazing shopping application tbh, a clean user experience and just an overall good experience"
Very useful app for sopping. Flipkart interface is very easy.
"Really Disgusting feel that I am not able to Login my FK acct again and not finding any calling No. to ask the reason behind it.... Very Ridiculous...to see that so called ""Bestest"" app has gone down to such low level of customer service that even after complaining through email 2 month ago, their no rep has contacted to address my ""automatic logout"" issue. User Interface of your app has a big flaw that it keep on asking to Login the FK acct from its subscriber who already facing Login issue."
nice interface
Bullshitting interface
Flipkart was initially better or equal to Amazon in terms of user experience. But Flipkart has deteriorated. I purchased a puma shoes and wanted to return because of size issue. They keep a long waiting period of about 20 days for return and then suddenly cancel the request without reason Then I had to call the customer care it has again kept 20 days period for pickup . The return was picked up immediately after posting this bad review. I think Amazon is far better. Never buy from Flipkart.
best interface in shopping app. Fast service and best offers. highly recommended
excellent 👌 service and app interface is also good
nice interface
Nice app and good interface
"Nise user experience, I would suggest to change the colour of cart's product number tag to less alerting If you change that you will got my five star 😊"
"review for app/software :user interface response very laggy and slow, gets hang often. need to close and restart again. especially going back to previous page takes lot of time and fyi my mobile is flapship and internet is also good speed.pls rectify the issue. otherwise its great online shopping platform - flipkart"
"Worst services in every aspect. Wheater it's a the customer support or dealers or customer interface. I had to explain my concern to every individual agents multiple times throughout the week and none of them bothered to even listen. In the end i had wasted my whole week and was falsely assured, further wrong commitment were given."
app interface could be better
Interface so slow please fixed it
User experience is superior to amazon
"Apart from making attractive user experience Flipkart team should solve their core bugs ,I am experiencing delivery not available for many products whenever I'm living in mainframe city like pune."
Horrible user experience
Not good interface.
"nice user interface, though the searches could still be streamlined a little bit"
"The app is good but there are some issues to look at it, like it keeps glitch when you do something with your wishlist and cart. I've been facing this peo since 2 to 3 month's but didn't resolve yet. (To developer: Stop adding the video, quizzes, spins, gambling and all that you're an shopping application not a streaming service, please focus on what you best at it like making useful user interface.)"
Very Interesting User Interface In Comparison Of Amazon
One of the wrost AAP i ever use Don't care about there customers The delivery boy make our fun Very bad user experience 😐😐
"Worst interface, too slow"
Sorry but App and site user experience trash
"Latest update ruined user experience, if i open an item from search result, it takes lot of time to load the list back when i try to get back to the list."
Please add filter for products which are currently unavailable and not deliverable. Its very irritating to see such products in results. Pathetic user experience.
"Whenever I am trying to return my order.... That's not happening.... I am trying from the last 3 days now.... But still there is an interface pops out showing ""opps! Some error occurred. Please try again later"". I am so pissed off from this now.... fix it"
1) APP INTERFACE IS SO BAD 2) DALIVARY SURVIS SO LATE 3) DALIVARY BOYS SO BAD 4) NO RETURN APPROVED 5) BAD APP IN THE WORLD 6) CUSTOMER CARE IS SO BAD 👎👎👎👎 PLEASE DON'T INSTALLED THIS APP - Shows 31 day return policy but blocks account when trying to return
"User experience is good. One minor bug which I noticed is - soon after I click on my orders, while loading my orders, screen title shows as null."
Dear Flipkart Your products are awesome 😎 and the interface is amazing 😍 but you're delivery 🚚 is very bad 😞 . When an order gone be delivered on Thursday than why it is delayed to Saturday. Improve your delivery 🚚 and don't broke the delivery promises.
Excellent Improvement in Flipkart application. UI Interface improved. On time Delivery.
"I am a go to Flipkart guy . I always order from here,and their service are also nice . But since one month - the app has become pathetic ,takes so much time to load and the interface is so slow and not user-friendly . Please do fix this !!"
User interface are good.
"From the last few weeks the app has become worst b'coz I have travelled many problems like whenever I wishlist any product after the app is closed it got diminished ,, the loading speed has also become slow and also the price option ... it shows only 2 or 3 numbers for e.g. if any product is of 3999 then it shows only 3,99. I don't know why these problems are happening but I may prefer the developer to overcome the user interface. That's it!!!!!"
"user interface is too eazy, so any person can spend more time on this app to search any products"
worst interface previous interface easy to use
very good site for shopping and it's interface Is fantastic 👌
Interface is getting better day by day . But Flipkart should provide system of contacting seller via messages or call
From past 2 months the app performance is too worst. Takes longer time to open. Hangs in between. Fix is needed for that. Hope the sleepy technical team resolves the issue at the earliest to have smooth interface for customers.
Flipkart has became the wrost app now . At this time all the other ecommerce applications have improved their delivery process . We surely get our products within 2- 5 days but Flipkart is doing nothing and has made there user experience very bad
interface is better than amazon
Now a days they have started another cheap trick to sell you things.From last five orders i am facing problem that interface will say buy it now and it will be delivered by tomorrow.Once you make the payment very next day the date will change to next day or another 2-3 days. Flipkart is auch a fruad i will never buy again from it. Fake ecommerce site.👎🏻
interface should improve a lot
After update facing many problems like IMEI not match with mobile model for exchange and many time something error coming !! Worst development team they have !! Needs to take seriously on user experience
"Why is the search result filled with products that are marked ""Not deliverable"". Shouldn't there be a filter to filter out those results? Flipkart is seriously lagging in basic customer Interface."
Very good interface and good option for home delivery in a cheaper price then market...hats off..
nice interface good service
The Pathetic..... Flipkart is no more trust worthy as it was. Reasons : 1) False dates of delivery. 2) Very pathetic customer issue resloving service. 3) Pathetic Refund process. I have to wait 20 days to get my refund??? . 4) Unfriendly user interface and technical glitches in the app. If these things are resolved Flipkart will be trusted by customers or else... Customers and their known ones will Never shop from Flipkart /recommend it.
"easy interface,nice and mostly genuine products😍😍"
Getting slower everytime and pages get stuck. Kindly gwt it smooth for better User experience.
"The user interface of Flipkart has degraded incredibly. i used to be a frequent customer of Flipkart but recently their customer service was so disappointing that i stopped buying from there. The prices are good, hopefully they will work in other aspects too."
Just make simple user friendly interface and fast. Is it too much to ask for🤬
"After 7 or 8 month busy schedule , I'm trying to login my Flipkart account but the interface shown my Flipkart account is blocked. I'm do not any fraud or misbehavior with Flipkart. So why my Flipkart account is blocked. My humble request please unblock my account. I need urgently for shopping."
"App's user interface is soooo cheap, and it seams like all reviews in this app is fake, i genuinely use Amazon and prefer it because when it comes to coustomer support Amazon team is far better then Flipkart, much of the product prices they show is fake including shopsy.. ""Only cheap people use Flipkart""... 😐"
customer friendly interface and easy to use this app...
"Please update the categories i am searching for last few days for BOOKS section, which is absent now in category. Please fix the interface"
Good interface and lightweight app. facilities are good and 8 out of 10 things we want are available. Deliveries are also fast 🚴三 and lots of options to pay and super coins to save money.
Very bad user experience with this application .😒.There are somany bugs. And bad customer service too.😖
Best app for online shopping and had best user interface. But I am facing some issues like I cannot connect to customer support because I want know some things about Flipkart pay later & Flipkart plus the flipkart application or website show all channels are busy from continuously past three days. Resolve this issues asap.
Unfair gaming interface
App is full of bugs. I don't understand why Flipkart is not working on fixing these bugs. App crashed several times while trying to track the order. These days even smaller business have a better user experience than Flipkart. It keeps getting worse day by day.
great user experience
"Since july 2022 , i am facing a very slow interface on the app ... From 1 page to another page it took much time to get load .... Fix that issue"
UI UX NOT COMFORTABLE... please change your apk ui interface...
"Flipkart has superfast interface but from couple of weeks it lags too much. Delay in loading product and it's details. If you back from any page it keep loading for 1-2 minutes which is irritating. I think there is some serious bug from few updates, which should be resolved otherwise customers like me are going to left this platform due to this serious bug and delay in loading pages."
worst interface
the app's new interface was not so good as old one
"User Interface is great, but sucks at operations. Orders get cancelled by sellers end frequently. Various malpractice by seller end to sell their products at very cheap price as a promotional event and cancellation of orders leading to a disbelief in Flipkart. So moved to Amazon and it's just great."
It's a good app it needs a bit of change in its user interface that's it. Overall a really good app for online purchasing.
Flipkart app is having some bugs from last few Months... its become Very Slow... Takes too much time to load Page... Flipkart app had smooth interface but it isnt anymore..fix it...
This update is not good previous ui or interface is more beautiful or simple.
very fast interface ....reasonably priced item
"Very bad UI interface.so,many bugs in app very bad bakend team work developer and tester both are doing very bad work such. 1. App opening slow and reloading- reloading many times 2.payment gateway proceed and proceed"
very nice i like interface of app
Very bad user experience. I can not believe this is flipcart. Having long loading time in app while trying to go back on another screen. Very much performance issue
"New interface is very bad. Values are showing as only two digit numbers. If not rectified, flipkart will become flopkart."
"Service and app interface is awesome but, not current day whenever i try to press back button then flipkart app is not working suddenly blind screen and not working"
The app and user interfaces are really good . the app is user friendly and customer service support is very helpful .the main issue in the app is we can't delete the search history.try to give option for that
"Lags too much, user interface not as good as amazon, for delivery... Its late, packaging is poor except mobiles and books"
Earlier interface was really gud but after latest update the experience is not very pleasing as the interface is too confusing with more brightness & bigger text size.
Sever is down all the time. Poor user interface. Amazon is much more user friendly and faster. Should be given zero. Amazon is much much much better. Stop using Flipkart. It sucks
"Baddest app now Lots of bug hangs cannot go back , Just loading Because of your Idiotic idea from make That Sopping app to a gaming app. I use since 2013 One of the best app interface i have experinced After that Game come Hate man fix it .."
"I am using this app, since 2012, but now there service and customer care experience is worst . Now I am deactivating Flipkart account for bad service and user experience"
"It seems that there is a problem with the platform's performance, as it takes a long time to fetch and load data, especially when trying to return to the product list. This can be incredibly frustrating and result in a negative user experience. The excessive buffering can also lead to a slow and sluggish experience, making it difficult to browse and search for products. PS: I checked with another network, but the same issues are being faced."
pathetic user experience
Very bad interface in updated version not open any item and other menu please check and fixed the problem
good user interface and fast process
Very bad user interface
Worst user interface!!
I've previously given it a 5 star.....but nowadays user experience has become just horrible Everytime when you press the back button it starts buffering for at least 2 mins..so much irritating I'm sincerely requesting please fix this problem
"Maybe it is time to switch from Flipkart to other apps hats off to their idiotic return policy, slow and poor interface."
Full of bug... Using it for many years but recently it's interface becomes so laggy and illiterate developers can't rectify those bugs
poor interface
I use Flipkart everytime I want to order something. So I got so many supercoins. But now I cannot see the option of using supercoins anymore. Also this app used to be smooth in interface. Now it is slow and options are changing randomly. It's annoying.
Untill now there is no problem. Easy interface to operate. Good buying experience.
I just using this app since a long time but now I am disappointed from this app before the update every thing is well but now this app frustrating me for many reasons because when I Order something quality and price is best but after the update every product is so expensive and product quality is not good according to the price. So please Flipkart change this interface .
"This app is trash , very worst userinterface and very slow too . It just buffering all the time so frustrating 😡deserve not a single star."
"Worst user experience while login using saved Gmail ID. They mentioned if the price of the item is more than Rs.500, then there won't be a delivery charge but leving delivery charge for items having price above Rs.500."
Too bad user interface and the application is too laggy an it keep getting refreshing
App UI interface lagging problem i face this problem after Flipkart application update please fix this lagging issue and provide batter optimising update very quickly 😡😡😡
excellent interface. any one can use it.
The app takes a lot of time to load content. It's very slow and just ruins user experience.
"Too much slow, all the time it shows something went wrong, not able to see even notifications. What kind of worst service it is. Worst user interface."
This application has worst interface. Buffering buffering &... Buffering ! Why ? I can't use this application due to this application. I ain't gonna recommend anyone to download this app for online shopping & stuff. 🙏 Thanks.
"Actually I'm a plus member of Flipkart. The interface is awesome but the response time of the app is more and due to heavy traffic in the app like games, the main content such as shopping, emi bill payment etc are getting slower and sometimes its unable to load. I've a good impression on Flipkart rather than Amazon but hope Flipkart will be redeveloped soon and by removing the games. Thankyou."
Your new app sucks in every aspect 🤧 bring back the old user interface
"This is best flatform to buy products, the interface is very simple than other platforms"
"The user experience was good on the app, but since last few days I'm getting constant pop up on flipkart app usually about a sale or an appliance service. But just to promote your new service/feature you're making the whole experience much worse. I don't understand how can such terrible UX/UI ideas gets approved in such a huge company. Terrible!"
Worst interface App running very slowly in recent times.
"App is too good, but don't know what's the problem going on these days. Interface is very slow, every single time it's just loading"
good system easy to use interface to place order
"flipkart is doing its best, to provide its customers best service, flipkart delivery system is very good & punctual, interface is quite good with perfect detailing"
Interface is very very very slow
I like your service as well as the graphical user interface and functionality of application and also I mostly like your refund service.
"Started to see too much ""Something went wrong"" errors for past few days. I hope Flipkart team is monitoring this sudden surge in errors, needs an immediate fix for this, ruins complete user experience."
Nice app Nice interface amazing experience to buy every product at affordable price . But lastly when I ordered a product which costs rupees 354 . After I received the order suddenly the price decrease to rupees 295 which is it's actually price. Why & How this happened
"Feedback on application. Lately, the app is opening on its old interface and then quickly tries to move to the new one. It often gets stuck in between and reminds me the 2G days. Pathetic experience on the app."
Very very 100000000times very bad user experience nothing available on this app
jabardast interface and product quality
App don't work properly and the image is not loaded any page is not able to load I am trying since three to four days I had to order something but as soon as I open it the interface is showing something went wrong
Worst user experience compare with other online apps! I having issues with delivery date or delivery items. It's delivered only in app not actually.. I have to contact the customer service (to option for Tamil) and they will close the raised issue in couple of days and ask me to raise again. repeatedly. last item still not delivered.. 21 days passed and I am still raising issues repeatedly. if have option I will give negative stars. worst online experience.. never ever going to order again. :(
This app is very Irritating when I click on any product only loading interface is coming
I cannot believe that its 2023 and the user interface of this app is so disgusting. It has this bug where when i click the back button it begins an infinite loading which just makes me mad and i have to restart the app everytime... theres no way i can use this app happily. Please do something about this flipkart and improve the UI.
Sellers are not selling genuine product and user interface of this app is not good.
Interface sucks seems like a normal kid made it! Not so friendly User Experience! Most of the popular applications were so keen on using dark mode Till this date no dark mode on this application don't know why? 🤔
"This app is hella annoying, I ordered a product worth 60k and paid already and these people are extending the delivery date again and again. I am hating this app. Pathetic user experience. Highly unrecomended!!!!"
user interface is awesome 👍
"Terrible user experience, need some serious work on client, keep buffering when i press back btn."
Loading takes too much time when we hit back button. It making worst user experience.
Very bad interface can't use
Everything is fine except the software experience. A lot of bugs is there to ruin your good user experience.
"Pathetic user experience. I can't open my account section from past few day, experience get worst day by day."
This app does not have the item which I needed(steam gift cards) and this apps interface is not that good .
Flipkart should fix the buffering issue especially the time taken to load the page when we navigate back from a product to the list. This is really annoying and creates a negative impact on user experience.
"Application interface is very slow, mainpage loading is very slow, please fix ASAP."
Good as a user interface
want more faster for user experience
"After update in March 2023 the application takes very slow loading times, causing frustration for users who are trying to quickly browse or purchase items. Additionally, some users may find the user interface to be cluttered or confusing, which can make it difficult to navigate the app efficiently.And the ordered items couldn't be cancelled."
This is the best platform and beautiful interface but now it was irritating takes lot time to open pages and loading plz resolve the issue fastly the latest version was only takes lot of time release before versions or updated version and solve the issue fast
"Very bad experience . Opening of app is irritating , something went wrong is the most common problem and happens everytime. Tracking page is not optimized properly. Please look into the matter . User experience is getting ruined ."
I'm a plus member from 5 yrs. I am also a prime member now but flipkart now adding delivery charges of all products which are flipkart assured and under 500rs... I'm facing this problem from more than 1 month. Also sometimes the app do not open and showing that no network available please retry.And the interface is lagging a lot. So my request to flipkart is to fix these issues 🙏🙏
"Definitely better than Amazon for me. App interface is realy good and good products. I ordered groceries from the app and one product was missing. I thought they will not give me a refund but after writing an simple email with the invoice attached, they did a full refund. Very happy."
Worst user interface
may be interfaces could be better.
"I've been using the Flipkart app for a while, and I have to admit that it's among the best shopping apps available. The pricing are fair, the product selection is extensive, and the user interface is simple. But, I just had a problem with my account, which was shut off owing to a technical error. I attempted to remedy the problem by calling the customer service hotline, but I was unable to do so because of some network problems."
Worst application Worst customer support Worst app user interface
The apps interface is very good and very easy to use.
Now this app has become useless. Most of the products shows currently unavailable. If any product is currently unavailable then what is the purpose of displaying it with other products? It has spoiled the user experience. That's the reason now have started shopping from Amazon.
Worst user experience!! I am unable to use my super coins at rupee 1 store!
"Very poor service and interface. I just paid the due of pay later, It started its usage fees in paylater for orders less than 1000 without any information to me when I was using on march. Even the strange thing is that, it says 5 rupees usage fees for amount less than 1000, and they have added a 17 rupees usage fee out of nowhere!"
"New interface is very complex to understand. I can't find my order section , my accout and many more."
Once you are in the app and just want to go to home page or any other section it just stucks right there keeps loading n loading.. worst user experience
Frist interface is better than this update Most useless application i bougth a phone with smartupgrade and miss to pay due amount then phone was locked and after payment done their costmer exicutiv now just troll me date after date Now im going to consumer court..verry bad experiance....
Stupid app ! Can't reactivate account nor can I create a new account! They ask for documents for verification and all such a long process and why do you need documents this is not a bank app !! There's no way to even create new account such a bad User experience! Pathetic experience. Never seen such login logics anywhere.
Worst app takes long time to open.... Pathetic interface
The app is not good User experience
"New interface make no sense...it has became very hard to access different items like...supercoin, wishlist etc..because icons are not easily available like in old interface"
"The app has become so dumb off late where loading a page takes ages and at times no response too. It keeps loading. That's not an ideal response time for API calls. This is the worst user experience for an app build by an ecommerce giant. If you people cannot build an app of highest quality even with a large size team, then you're in with a higher user churn rate. Flipkart plus membership is now of no benefits for the users. It's high time flipkart brings back free delivery for plus members."
good interface
Interface is getting extremely slow
"I don't know what is happening with this app since 2 month, It is lagging at every step, sometimes it takes 2 to 3 min to come out from product catalogue, kindly fix it asap, because it's user experience is becoming painful day by day."
"Flipkart service was worst, is and will be always. Now they have started delivering wrong products most of the time. Application loading is very very slow at every page. Difficult to get backward. It just become white blank page for a long time. Very sucking interface. Most irritating application now a days"
"I personally like this app compared to its competitors user interface is good costume support is good by combining everything shopping experience is awesome but i faced so many problems like late delivery, delivered expired products in my case aashirvaad atta I got refund after fighting for 1week that's a different story i don't know it happened to or for everyone i faced problems with 8 times out of 10 even sometimes product doesn't delivery until I cancel it. Risk to reward is not matching"
I am a flipkart user.The app has good user experience except in some areas like delivery of products in its original states.
"Over the last few updates, the app has too many bugs, be that with alerts, the interface and the wishlisting options. Get them resolved soon..."
One of the best shopping app I used very simple interface and easy to use . no words to talk about flipkart it's a very good app I liked it 👍🏻👍🏻😊😊
I had to opt my Android phone to enter card details and complete the order as your User Interface within your application in my iPad didn't allowed me to enter card expiry details and this is been a long story and continued ever after many updates in my iPad.
Giving three stars just because of its Interface.. This apps works too slow. Even it loads an image too late that anyone gets annoyed. Please fix it And make flipkart app more faster. Then i will give it 5 stars definitely.
"@flipkart, please fix your interface bugs. Whenever I try to open filpkart pay later and other sections, it keeps blinking for a very long time keep reloading again and again. This is really irritating and somethime even doesn't open the tabs I try to open. This will effect my repayment on-time."
user interface of app is good 👍🏻
User interface is very slow. Takes lot of time. Please improve.
Best User Interface and Serffing all Categories Products smooth
"User experience on Flipkart begins with a simple and easy-to-use interface that lets customers browse through products without any hassle. The website is designed to cater to the needs of users of all ages and backgrounds, with well-organized categories, filters, and a search bar that enables customers to find what they are looking for easily. The range of products available on Flipkart is impressive, with a vast collection of items from popular brands and sellers. The website features both"
Third grade user experience. I want to return a product. But only order section is crashing everytime I try to return. This is harrasment of a customer.
"While offers can be fantastic on occasion, user experience has declined recently. The last two to three times I've ordered something, it says the order would be delivered the following day, but the delivery date keeps getting pushed out. My attempts to review my order history in the app occasionally result in the message ""something went wrong""."
"The app is so much laggy...once you click on size then it takes minutes to depict the availability and price of that particular size.. Also once you click back button, the app takes like millions of years to reach back to the main menu.. There's no option to give stars in minus otherwise i could have given Minus 10 Stars to this app.. DEFINITELY not happy with the user experience of this App.."
"What is the value of Indian rupee, who is the authorised person to decide that, flipkart need to understand that first.. And app interface and filter, sorting options are good.. But how the every product having 4 Star Rating, this is a big scam on Indian people by Walmart and flipkart.."
User interface better than amazon
very much User friendly interface. unlike other apps. makes Flipkart my favourite shopping app
The service is degrading. App user experience is too bad.
"Well, I earlier rated it 5 star but bcz of some reason I have to reduce it. Reason being unavailability of many products. Many brands not only exotic ones but also local ones are not available. I really love flipkarts service and interface, but if products are not available then what's use of other things,. I searched for St botanica products, Plum new series, wow ,shwarzkopf even vega, which are easily available on other sites. Plz broad ur basket flikart. We guys really want to see u rise"
"User Interface is very well maintained, but some of the images is of low quality which is not viewable well to compare with other products.and also some sellers specifications and product quality is completely different"
"I wish to tell you something about user experience. In your app search bar experience is very poor for the users because that was only activate if we click on search 🔍 button or logo , I suggest you to add a search activity to the holl search bar"
"If I had the power to give - minus rating then it would be great. Every time when try to search something it starts loading, In every 10-15 days it shows for update but no improvement only loading and lagging. When try to open wishlist then it loads about a minute. What is this . It feels most irritating for use. I am writing after about 5-6 times update of this app, but sad to say that after every update it feels most worst user interface in this app. Totally bad experience with Flipkart."
"Flipkart has actually lost its value ,its no more like before ,what it use to be 2-3years !!! Its very disappointing to write same,it use to be my one click away for all my e-store shopping requirement. Now Starting from customer service to its application user experience it has became pathetic. 1)No proper commitment regards to delivery date etc 2)No proper customer service, no proper communication from agents ,English speaking worst!!! 3)Wrong product delivery for every 2nd order..."
Revised my rating from 5 star to 1 star due to the lagy interface after latest updates. Once flipkart is having the better UI and UX as compare to Amazon but now we are getting worst updates.
"Worst user interface!!! I am unable to see the ordered item. And unable to track it. It's just showing ""something went wrong""."
"Interface is very slow ,it keep on lagging very frustrating"
"New user interface with grocery taking half of top menu, it's gross, and very cheap feeling app, it worse than old snapdeal app."
Poor interface
why am i seeing shopsy interface in Flipkart app ?
"These is ""THE"" Worst shopping app here on Play Store. I wouldn't even give one star if it was possible. First they promised no delivery charges for plus users on Flipkart assured products but now started charging for it. Pathetic app interface slowest loading even on fastest internet connection."
The user interface has gone downhill
Application is too slow.... really frustrated of using this..... very poor performance bad user experience
It has been so Buggy since it has its new interface.literally it takes more than 20-30 sec if you click on back button to refresh.
"Fake app with fake products, extremely poor customer service and app interface"
Worst . User interface
Something went wrong ekdum bekar interface h
"No doubts the interface is really good, but after clicking on any product and then want to return back or go back , it's taking more time, quite more, needed to be fixed. Today I uninstalled, reinstall the app, and the issue has been resolved."
Facing slow loading in last few weeks. Whenever I go to any product and come back it takes a lot of time. Continuous loading icon everytime I try to open and see any product is just irritating and spoils the user experience of the app.
Flipkart is my first shopping preference as it is quite user friendly interface and ease of using app
"What a rubbish experience, I never see this type of problem.. Whenever I opened the app it show shopsy interface and the I was surprised this app is converted into shopsy. Check this problem Flipkart team immediately"
Worst app interface after recent changes. I think Flipkart team doesn't care for the categories section as it used to before. The new update has made it much awful to use. You are definitely gonna loose customers with this GUI. Unable to fetch or track order as well.
The interface is always bugging
User interface nice
"Such a pathetic experience😤 Recently it has happened that.. the actual delivery date is surpassing the expected delivery date, moreover there is a hell lot of lag in the application's interface. Flipkart is no longer what it used to be earlier. Shut down the company. No need of it now. Rip Flipkart."
very good interface
"Hi, I am regular customer of Flipkart, but from few days i am facing slowness, to open simple page also it's taking time. It's irritating and checking my patients level. No one can expect this type of leading Ecomorce site will give you. If it's continues hope you will loose 60% customer. As a market leader in Ecommerce you should maintain better user experience please work on it."
Bad user experience while tracking the order. Page is not opening and gives the error which is very irritating. Please work on this ASAP.
"I've been a Flipkart user for years, but lately, the website and app are performing poorly. Pages and tabs take a long time to load, and the review section is giving me trouble. I believe Flipkart should invest in more resources to support the user-generated content feature, provide better customer service, and optimize the user interface and experience. If these issues persist, I may consider other options."
"Have started to become very slow, like loading of products works fine , bu then on going back the page freezes up. The user experience is really messed up, initially it was Amazon but now Flipkart also."
"To make matters worse, when my package finally arrived, it was damaged and the item inside was broken. I attempted to return it through the app, but the process was confusing and I ended up having to pay for shipping myself. Overall, I would not recommend this online shopping app. The user experience was frustrating and the customer service was lacking. Save yourself the headache and shop elsewhere. If you don't believe please message me I'll share order ID don't trust flipkart"
GOOD USER INTERFACE
Genuine price and best User Interface experience among others.
It's became slowest App in this 5g ara. wrost user experience.
They should update a dark mode motion as It stains eye at night and User experience feels very smooth and fast and offers are great
"What happened to user interface,it is becoming poor and poor"
"Flipkart is a worst app nowadays At starting they doing well but now They don't listen consumers problem Many days ago I call Flipkart coustomer care and said that I faced Flipkart interface issue ""In my account it not showing Flipkart interface it's shows shposys interface"" I said them to solve this but they don't fixed it ."
Very worst app. Interface also bad experience. Because of when i go to my orders its showing always something wrong with refresh page. . I uninstalled.
"The experience is getting worse. Few months back, this app was the easiest and fastest way to look for product and buy. But it's not the same case now. The user experience is getting degraded day by day. Takes lot of time for processing payments, loading things, even I'm not able to open and see the details of my order. Please fix this as this app has now started testing the patience of customers and will loose many customers if it stays as is."
"With so much of bad reviews about the time required for opening the app and browsing the products (even while going to previous page) in the app, I am surprised that rather than working on improving the user experience, they still want a mail asking for the problems and browsing experience. Shows how unprofessional the team is."
They have no secured interface for pay later. At least there should be pay payment varification with otp or password. There is no security. I usually get 4 to 5 spam massage every day with a link from Flipkart but it was not official massage and was about pay later. Thats why i am afraid of what happened if someone stolen my account if click that link. Please add a paymenta varification.
I have logged in to tha Flipkart app but it's showing sopsy app interface . What the hell is this . I just uninstalled Flipkart 😡😠
"App user interface, deals are good but an item I ordered was marked delivered though i did not receive it. One literally has to jump through hoops on the app to contact customer care and they couldn't resolve the issue. I wasn't willing to bankroll a delivery associate's dishonest lifestyle in the future, so Flipkart lost a customer. Simple solution: send a numeric pin to the customer that the associate has to enter on delivery to ensure it was done. Fix your system Flipkart."
I don't know why one day I open app and it's interface changed to that of shopsy I don't know it's intentional or a glitch but please fix it we want Flipkart interface only I have also checked other phones but it's the same as before I don't know it's only in my phone or what. Sent mail but no response from Flipkart
"The new shopsy app user experience is very bad, I'm uninstalled the app and using website"
Order Interface Is Not Opening.
"paysense has a user-friendly interface, making it easy to navigate and find what you need."
I am facing different kinda problem like I am just using lite version of flipcart after installing the full version of it. And the interface is just same as shopify why is it so. Can anyone explain me what is it happening to this application.
Really bad user experience !! The Home button should be visible on every page to help to navigate back to home screen rather than clicking back key multiple times..
Very irritating when i am opening the app this is taking somuch time my internet is very good and i am using updated version still i am facing this problem app is slow in processing everything and it always ever day changes the application interface which is most irritating
I haven't seen a worst shopping app than the Flipkart....such a worst user interface.... nothing works properly.....i still don't know why I am still having this in my phone.
"very nice shopping app, awesome interface easy to use"
"TIME HERE TIME PASS & GO,NO ON TIME DELIVERY CAN'T PASTE LINK IN PRICE HISTORY APP,POOR CUSTOMER SUPPORT,LAST DELIVERY,NOT USER FRIENDLY INTERFACE, CONSUMING LOT OF DATA & BATTERY CONSUMPTION,MOST IRRITATING AND FRUSTRATING APPLICATION EVER."
App interface was perfect before but now developer has made it so much complex that it's impossible for old people to navigate the app and even for me it's very difficult. Can't find my order page anywhere in the app. Made it so much difficult.
100 people below me are pointing out the same thing. Same issue with relaoding the page and going blank. This is a horrible user experience and Flipkart tech team is only happy to respond to reviews as I see no action based on the reviews.
"soo slow, unable to refresh, too much bugs in interface, I don't know when these kind of things Flipkart solve or why they aren't taking it seriously. It's a huge turn off for such a famous platform like Flipkart."
The interface of this is so easy . The products on this got cheaper from market ❤️❤️❤️
Loading loading and loafing......it gets wrost after the update......still wrost app.....buffering hote rhta hai....thoda invest kr lo...coding team me kamino....itna bekar user experience hote ja ra....abhi bhi ghatiya chal ra ye app ....loading or sirf loading maro sale
Worst customer service interface.
"Pathetic interface now , app isn't working also. Whenever you select some profile details itbwont pop up or will keep on loading . Same thing goes for each section when you want to check any past transaction. Flipkart support has been becoming worst these days."
"Change ur interface, something wrong"
Where the hell is My account section. ? If you chamge the interface atleast have the courtesy to make a guided tour. Before that guide me to my account section.
"Seems like the my account section is forgotten somewhere. We can simply add products,not know when it will come. Ridiculously poor user interface the new one"
Layout and interface is very good but most of the time while trying to open the app in my moto g it shows unknown error. Also if the net is slow it is almost impossible to open the app whereas other shopping apps opens effortlessly Update after V.7.66-Interface is confusing. Even I couldn't locate the my order section. Previous one was better. Revert to the previous version
"After latest update on May 2023, user interface gone very bad. No menu to access account on home page."
These day user interface has become WORST. Because of it i am avoiding shopping from flipkart.
"When ever i try to search or try to open any interface it just showing something went wrong,then i cleared data of flipkart again the problem is repeating,I AM UNABLE TO OPEN ANY INTERFACE IN FLIPCART. SOMETHING WENT WRONG."
interface is better than Amazon
"Hello there, recently I logged in to shopsy with the same mobile number used in Flipkart. After then whenever I try to login to Flipkart app, the app shows the interface of shopsy instead of normal Flipkart. This is very irritating. Please fix it as early as possible"
very nice user experience is better than Amazon
Great app.. less price and more over faster delivery... Only delivery charge needs to be less...for a 120 ripees product 70 rupees delivery charge is awful Update: now the app is loading very slowly. Do you fire all the good employees due to recession? Its very bad user experience. A simple back is taking 20-30 seconds.
"I am a loyal customer to Flipkart application and I am debited with my friends, Flipkart application user interface is far better then Amazon user interface but What you done to user interface after 01-06-2023. Its looking very cheap. I am not at all happy. Please roll back to previous user interface."
This is such a wrost app. It takes an hour to search an item. If you view an item and try to get back to the list of items it is taking forever. This app become a disaster. If people can't use this app please stop your application. Such a horrible user experience. This is not expected from app like Flipkart.
now days Flipkart interface is buffering
The interface take a lot of time. Very poor delivery and takes a lot of time 🤢🤢.
need a good interface and a user friendly and please give good seller and there rating. please peak out bad sellers
Why the interface of filpkart become shopsy? This new version of this app is disgusting. I didn't even get my products with ease which it used to be? I don't know who got this idea to merge app interface of Flipkart with shopsy.......very simple I want product of choice with little difficulty.... I don't have much time to go through the shopsy's unbranded products.
Flipkart having a lot of varieties of products and it's user interface is very good... overall satisfied with the price of products and varieties
"it is good user interface application, service is also awesome"
Worst Online Delievery Service Everr I have Seen....Even The App Ui Interface is getting strucked while accessing to the Orders page... When it comes to the users Who Prepaids To the Item The delievery Will Be Very Late ..They not even Care about Customer' s Urgency And Convienence Those who paid Prepaid..When it comes to cash On delivery The delievery Will be superfast .. Beacause They want money right..It shows 2 days Delievery time..Its been One week since i not received my Order What is this
I am having worst experience in this app.As I am trying to login into my account it asks password but I have forgotten it. But in its interface their is no option to recover password or to send OTP.. The worst among this was to contact consumer care but their was only one reply and that to was only to track our order....literally it is becoming worse among worse.
"The current Flipkart update us worst!! The homepage doesn't load completely, the grocery section removed but still u get notified for the same, this is insane. I am definitely willing to give a five star rating, but the recent experience and interface has been causing lot is issue...so holding it back. Hope you could restore to the previous version, way more comfortable and dedicated section. In a place whr no other grocery delivery works, Flipkart is real happiness!!"
User interface is very slow.
What is wrong with the Application. There is no option in the application which let you view/manage orders. Horrible user interface. I understand you want to make more sales that doesn't mean u put items everywhere and don't let any place for profiles and other details. I HAVE UNINSTALLED FLIPKART AND WILL NEVER INSTALL OR RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO IS LOOKING FOR WHOLESOME SHOPPING SERVICE. AMAZON IS BEST WHEN IT COMES TO ONLINE SHOPPING SERVICE.
"very nice,easy and convinient interface....good app...."
Worst interface. It takes too much time to loading.
App is not working properly taking so much time to load the product interface application is super slow
very good app for shopping... especially the app interface is very terry much amazing and clean
"I use to prefer flipkart over Amazon for its light interface quicker response but now seems like they're doing Prank! ""Your product will deliver on ** date"" Oh it was a prank wait 3more days!!! I'll call you whenever I want to deliver Once my product will deliver I'll delete this s**t immediately!!!"
This app has become pathetic takes a huge time to load plus sometimes get stuck..with every update its getting worse nd worse idk what the devs are doing but it's really bad ... amazon is better than this...plss Flipkart fix this issue such a slow interface sometimes i get so frustrated that i switch to other platforms....
I love Flipkart but app interface is very slow please solve this so sad please help 🙏😭
easy user interface
"Ok this ""was"" a good app, but by each update it's becoming more hard to use. Its a hassle to search for all options. Its not user-friendly now. Make sure to organize your interface in a manner that easy and faster to use instead of making users go around circles."
I don't know how is developing this app making worst user experience day by day.the app is just keep loading everything
I'm facing a issue of interface it showing only shopsy interface
From the past few months user interface is horrible whenver we tap on product to view after that when we click back it takes decades to go back 😡
"very nice application,easy to use and I like the interface."
Worst application with worst user interface and poorest customer service. Unistalled it few minutes back
Worst user experience. No good design for performance. Loads for seconds in basic operation while surfing
"The interface was miles better in the previous version , the new update just ruined it ,it feels like im using some third party app."
I really dislike the current user interface after the update I really dislike how this app
Iam a plus member I unknowingly clicked on claim button on supercoin offer session 150 coins got redeemed There should be confirmation interface before redeeming this was a huge mistake in flipkart and I contacted customer service they told it is not be able to return or cancel it
Ekart delivery system is one of the Worst. Delivery boy directly say no to deliver. One of the Worst user experience.
"I love the offers and user interface of this app but it's become so slow since some years, frustrated by the poor speed and performance."
Great app with its user interface
your login interfaces too problematic. Here user can login with ph no+password+OTP. But if user forgot the password there is no option of 'forgot password' .
"I've been using the Flipkart app for quite some time now, and I must say it has completely transformed my shopping experience. This app deserves all the accolades for being the go-to platform for online shopping. First and foremost, the user interface is incredibly user-friendly and intuitive. Navigating through various categories and finding the products I need is a breeze. The search functionality is fast and accurate, saving me precious time while looking for specific items."
nice user experience
App interface is good and all but the support experience is worst. They can cancel the order anytime without your approval and they won't provide a valid reason if you call..
"interface looks excellent and it's intuitive. However, my order screen either takes too long to load or doesn't load altogether.Kindly fix this so that I can track my orders in a better way."
"One of the most disorganised under-optimized, substandard user interfaced app I have ever seen. It's like a 80's newspaper ad . Difficult to navigate, find and compare products."
"easy and very simple to use the app interface, nice to purchase"
poor app interface
After this update my location now everything seems to have turned out to be undeliverable 😬😬😬 updates are supposed to make the app more light and usable but this turned out to be trash. Someone who suggested this interface must be fired. Is someone at Flipkart listening ?
"multiple product app with all ranges and sizes according to customer need . Easy to order place, easy to cancel, features mentioned below easy interface .Overall u can say its a Satisfactory when u explore in it."
"To begin with, the entire ordering process was riddled with inefficiencies and technical glitches. I encountered numerous difficulties while navigating through your website, which was slow and unresponsive. The search function failed to yield accurate results, making it an arduous task to find the specific product I desired. This lackluster user experience left me feeling frustrated and exhausted before I even completed my purchase. Please consider this feedback seriously,"
"While the app has potential and some commendable features, the presence of numerous bugs, slow-loading order page, and overall sluggish responsiveness significantly impact its usability. It is my hope that the developers address these issues promptly and provide a more polished and reliable user experience in future updates."
"We have download this application after Amazon stopped it's grocery & The interface of this app is too crowded...Not simple Like Amazon...Very Bad Web designing...👎🏻 सब कुछ एक जगह भर दिया गया है!नए यूज़र के लिए तो बिल्कुल भी फ्रेंडली app नहीं है!❌👎🏻 पसंद नही आया इसका डिस्प्ले❌❌❌ इसीलिए कुछ भी नहीं मंगवाया .. इसकी डिज़ाइन को simple करें,बड़े उम्र के लोग तो बिल्कुल भी मोबाइल एप यूज़ नही कर पा रहे हैं!बहुत ही छोटे icons हैं; चीज़ें जितनी सिंपल होती हैं;उतनी ज़्यादा लोकप्रिय होती हैं..!"
"This is app is really not upto the mark when it comes to user interface, the icons, the animation, the smoothness, it lacks all of it. Filter option is really useless as well, instead of my product they start showing me unnecessary stuff, they have to work alot in app development and interface."
"The app is user-friendly and offers a wide range of products across various categories. First and foremost, the app's interface is clean and intuitive, making it easy to navigate and find what I'm looking for. The search function works well, allowing me to quickly find specific products or browse through different categories. I also appreciate the option to filter and sort the search results based on my preferences, which helps in narrowing down the choices."
Trying pay the pay later option hell of bugs and technical glitches loading and loading keeps loading need to Uninstall the app. 0% no worth of this app software fully trash. I don't know why app user interface maintenance is this much worst
Worst technical interface of any shopping app. It wont recognise the mobile number and it wont authenticate via otp also. Customer service will put you on hold for 12 mins and cut the call. Its not like we are dying to shop on your app
I think there is a big bug app's users interface is worst. Flipkart just do something.
user experience is not good..got errors while purchasing... during address update and payment
Worst app for online shopping. The interface is too much laggy and the buffering is almost like an decade of insanity. This makes me mad everytime I use this app 😡😡
App has login interface issues. I went for the option of signing in from email. But then it immediately asks for nlmobile number. And is not forwarding it further.
"New interface it absolutely good, although older ver is on hand anlong, overall I'm in the batch of good customer satisfaction and no doubt the return service is too good from Amazon, the worst company ever"
Bad experiences because some many filter are not work perfectly and when I buy item from this website I come back to flipkart interface so I give 1 star to this application
"Actually This is my first order from Flipkart , apart from this i like the interface is very friendly and it working smoothly. Best features is that showing the no of customer buy in last 7 days..."
it good and easy to use interface
"The Flipkart application has become a go-to platform for millions of shoppers in India, offering a vast selection of products across various categories. With its user-friendly interface and convenient features, Flipkart has created a seamless shopping experience for its customers. Thanks for making life simple.🤝"
some improvement are their user interface not uptomark so lagy as soom aa possible aolve this issue.
Good interface for online shopping
"Good for shopping but now in some days it shows really really very bugs feel like I m using a useless app. So miserable So disgusting If any one from Flipkart reading this review please improve your bugs and user experience . Shame on you Flipkart / Amazon is doing better job than u . 😡😡😡😡🤬, Flipkart Teri bahin ka chhodo madarchod,no one order grocery or anything from Flipkart they cancelled anything anytime own there own , so uninstall Flipkart now , Teri bahin ka chhodo gadari karbe ."
"Has a category button, doesn't go into categories. I don't want offers, just give me direct access to all the categories at the very start. Have to scroll all the way down, after all the brand sponsored categories, to reach categories drop down. Acquired Myntra but couldn't acquire the seamless user experience Myntra has."
"Travelling towards doomsday! Flipkart has lost its USP. Tough and frustrating to navigate. The app has lost its simplicity. Service quality has drgraded, politeness vanished, and most importantly the user interface of the app has become worst."
HONEST user review Don't make interface messy and don't try to sponsor ads otherwise you will face issues like amazon.
Very smooth experience overall good app and keep more optimize for better user experience.
"I am giving 1 star because I don't have option to give 0 stars, else I will give zero stars. Which commerce platform will block user account for having few returns on the order's that user kept? Answer: none except Flipkart. I had ultra terrible user experience with Flipkart."
Good User interface
Awesome user experience
Invoices cannot be downloaded from the app itself. Day by day the app service is deteriorating.Also very buggy and slow. Despite having good network it takes a long time to open a product page or add something to cart.Very disgusting interface.
User interface need improvement tbh its very slow Products may be genuine but the apps experience is not nice it is really slow
Need to wait for long long time after every click on app. It's getting hanged a lot. Ver bad user experience.
User interface is very bad
good user interface
Please do work on the user interface.. this app just sucks data and does gives a lot of loading and buffering.. and please do also work on the customer service.. I am annoyed of this scramble everyday.
In the new interface I can't find my orders and account options
Worst app management and user interface also not good
Good interface and all functionalities works properly.
clumsy payment interface. Payu screen overlay is irritating
Worst User Interface ans worst customer service ... If you forget password they don't give you forget password option... It's very simple to use other apps rather than this
I don't get why the application's interface is so complicated
"Flipkart has gone from good to worse and even worse every single day previous interface of app was so easy to use categories were on home page and now categories have been to somewhere else where it is so,hard to access your needs...and also faced issue in handling app in split screen."
"Bad interface, and interface doesn't load and very slow speed facing these problems from 2 -3 months, Flipkart make its app worst by its."
Beware of misleading information available on their website. They do not publish negative user experience. product reviews are handpicked by there backend team. Many cases of used products delivered on sealed packages. Customer servise is trained to support these scams. I Would suggest to use trustworthy app like Amazon.
this app very bad user interface
Nice interface
Easy interface.. only SKU has to increase
improve on payment interface
great experience and it's so easy to use with a user friendly interface
Worrest service Evey time it says this item is not deliverable to this location but I am not in Forrest I am in capital city Telangana(HYDERABAD) it's very shame to Flipkart and so many bugs in application refreshing issues strucking some times soo many... User interface is looking very good but not perfectly optimised it.
Interface is very bad like some cheap third class chinese scam shopping app
excellent user interface and easy shopping
Old version ui interface is good but latest is very bad
Enhance user interface and graphics and customer experience and service
app is very buggy. nothing works in the interface other than the homescreen
Why Flipkart is worst user interface sometimes
"I felt pleasure to use this app , it's really nice app as it's interface is very good and they give us original product and deliver on time this is best of all shopping apps.."
"The app used to be better, there is a defect or feature idk if it's intentional or not but now when ever I open a product from the list of products and try to see the pics without fully opening the product Pics in full screen view it doesn't allow to see more than 3 pics without opening the Pic of the product in full screen. Please fix this bug if it's unintentional since it makes the user experience worse."
Pathetic experience with Flipkart .I reinstalled the app after my phone reset and trying to login I forgot the password..The app should provide me the option to reset the password instead it asked me to connect to customer care...i did...then they asked me to send an email with my ID proof n ol..why so much lengthy process.instead just have a button to reset my account password.....send me an email with password link...why one should send govt Id to them .....Pathetic user experience
User Interface is degrading day by day
the browser interface gives strange behavior like inability to ship to a Mumbai pin code. the app is better but not as smooth as it should be.
Most of the products are of low quality. No proper customer support. Nonsense user interface. Amazon is better than this app. And the new advertisement on TV is more irritating than this app 😅 Play Store should introduce minus star option so that we can give proper ratings.
Worst User experience
Flipkart user experience is very worse. In my each order (grocery) one or more products are either missing or damaged. On calling customer service resolutions are not provided. Refund/Return requests are raised for the formality and later requests are rejected.
The app experience is bad even at 5g the app takes long time to load the screen. IT should look and make it user experience better
Good interface
Utterly disappointing user experience and optimisation of app from last update
"I Re-edit me review. Dear Developers of Flipkart, Whenever we Back navigate from a product, it takes a lot of time to get back which make us Irriteted while using the App. So my sincere request to you, please make it Fast so that user experience may be good. I am also a student of Information Technology and I aspire to become the team member the Development Team. Thanku Developers."
need to improve interface
Best shopping app I am really thankful to its interface and ui Its way ahead of its competitors in this field
Great user experience and user interface. Also liked that it processes international card more smoothly without being sent an OTP everytime
not so good interface
"Pathetic user experience. I had ordered a phone under exchange policy. Had formatted the old phone and was ready to exchange. I even confirmed twice with Flipkart whether delivery is confirmed. At the last minute they cancelled the delivery. Had to reinstall all apps in my old phone. Pathetic useless euser experience. Switching to amazon or other options. Their UI is confusing as hell too, filled with distracting ads"
"Stupid app and stupid customer service. I tried to login Flipkart with my contact number after so many years, I forgot the password. It should either send me OTP to my no. or to mail id. But it's showing only contact customer service. When I call them, they asked my profile name, city, pincode. I answered them for those three questions. Then they're asking me mode of payment of last order, how do I remember it. How stupid and what a bad user experience to just reset a password."
"Worst app!! interface and customer care experience. The app doesn't work when you want to raise a issue. The customer care executives try to manipulate you accordingly. As I had a query about the discount on credit card purchase the representative of Flipkart was saying that ""No, sir the scheme is not for SBI credit cards it's for debit cards"". They lie so blatantly that I was amazed by their skill and the next thing was that they ask you the screenshots for the issue and needed through app."
The customer support is very poor and the chatbot doesn't work at all in solving the problems faced . I applied for exchange of a product but there was no pickup and no delivery received by me yet on the interface it is showing item received. I had been trying to contact their help centre for days and haven't recieved a call yet . The company will surely fail if they keep indulging in these practices.
"Open sidebar Flipkart Review & Experience Default (GPT-3.5) User Flipkart review in 500 wourd ChatGPT Flipkart is one of India's leading e-commerce platforms, offering a wide range of products from electronics to fashion and home goods. The platform has gained popularity due to its user-friendly interface, vast product selection, and competitive pricing. One of Flipkart's standout features is its user interface, which is intuitive and easy to navigate. This makes it simple for users to serch"
Easy to navigate user interface
Very bad user experience 😡. I was searching sony blutooth speakers and Flipkart showing me another company speaker without showing that🙁
Interface is laggy. If I give 5 star review to any product it gets published instantly and when ever I receive any poor quality product and leave a negative review it never gets publish. Flipkart is only trying to keep positve reviews for their products. They are trying to manipulate product ratings
"Very poor interface and pathetic service of customer care team. They talk from home, and chewing tobacco in mouth dealing with customer."
"The last update has made the app ugliest ever, it removed the blue borders made made the user interface worst. Now It's hard to distinguish between option on the application."
"Worst user interface. Unable to claim offer and even after showing the discount/ offer and additional exchange reduction, the final price remains the same."
I facing a big issue I can't login to my paylate interface after update solve the problem I have to pay my of the month
Flipkart day by day is dying seriously needs interface improvement..Amazon way ahead with more variety of products. Flipkart these days seems like a cheap website. You were once a leading e commerce site atleast don't degrade to such extent.. Day by day price of same product changes customer are not fool.
I wish I can give 0 star .... Worst interface and worst services .... Idk how are they even surviving with such an app
The flipkart pay later interface is all gone now...no option to pay even my credit limit is shown as 0.
the best platform to use for... so smooth user friendly interface and easy to access every section. feel overwhelmed of getting these benefits so far
"Better to add 1 day delivery to prime members like Amazon, it will definitely bring new customers to this app because of easy interface and good offers, Hope this will happens soon"
Laggy and worst customer support I've been using flipkart from past 7 years. The user experience and interface of app is going worse to worse day by day. It shows ad results or promoted products. Redirects error page many times. Froud sellers and sending less units and haven't any refund or return policy. Flipkart's customer support system is time wasting. Don't provide any solution. Both sellers and flipkart are cheating customers. No sales no discounts no customer satisfaction. Useless app.
very good user interface
poor user interface.takes so much time to load pages everytime we click back button .try to fix it please
I don't even understand what's wrong with Flipkart mobile app for yhe last 1yr or so...it hangs most of the time can't load quickly... really horrible user experience..but products are fine tho
"I have been using the Flipkart application for quite some time now, and I must say, it has greatly enhanced my shopping experience. The app offers a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate, making it a breeze to find and purchase products. One of the standout features of the Flipkart app is its vast product selection."
The app keeps on loading even if you've got high speed internet. Not satisfied with the app interface.
nice app interface and good services
Amazon is too much better. I suggest to make interface unique than other applications. On the other hand it's a very nice shopping destination. All the best 👍
"Very bad user interface before update there a section of where a user can easily check no cost emi that on credit but in thisnew app, user experience worsen why you update like this"
Poor interface taking too long
"the user interfaces are changed, and it's very convenient to do shopping."
Best user interface I ever see.
good interface
good interface
"Nice and easy to load, smooth and clean interface, friendly support"
"Worst shopping app, can't login to my account and the app is saying login to contact customer care, totally illogical and non sense interface. I wrote a email and still didn't receive any support."
Very satisfied.Good user interface.Think for all type of expectation of every people.But also need more improvement.Overall good.Keep it up. Now it is going to worst even prime plus member does not get delivery at specified date and further even 2 days late.
Not even deserve 1 star pathetic user experience. I would recommend not to buy any product from Flipkart. I ordered children shoe and they delivered the adult shoe. I ordered a replacement and delivery boy came and said the product is not original and refused to take it. I called customer care and they said we will not refund and replace either. Now issue is 1. Product is fake does not have brand name 2. Product is not returnable as per consumer rights the product should be refundable.
Tab headings not visible fully. Interface is not convenient.
good and easy to use UI (user interface)
This app is way too slow and crashes all the time. Not a good experience! Edit 24 Sep 2023: This app is still so pathetically low and hangs/crashes all the time and the developers wouldn't even care to reply let alone solve the issue and improve the app interface.
improve app interface
"Pathetic user experience, no fix even after several complaints. Poor returns policy. I now try to avoid Flipkart."
In the interface show the product but out of the delivery received another prdoct it's type scam and refund option not enabled
Worse interface and loading
"New update made app worst! The three interfaces making it to lag and mainly consuming more data,if you proceeding with this then i will be deleting the app."
now shopping in flipkart is not easy it's interface was not good.. so much clumsy and biggest headache is chat bot its not giving desired response. its very hard to talk with customer care... finally customer satisfaction was not their primary objective at all..... better to switch Amazon platform or any others....
"2023 big billion is mess and seems more like a scam, customers have some common sense at least stop varying prices like no one noticed and call that an offer. BTW thought amazon user interface and search was bad kudos to the team which designed the big billion day reveal and all unnecessary gimic. Confused 😕 What's up guys you pay the highest salary in the market to your workforce at IT hire some customers 😜 for feedback to keep things simple. Best of luck for 2024."
Flipakart new app is taking to much time to load... I suggest flipkart should make one another app as lite which will load earlier and give better user experience..
The interface I really hate it of when u swipe to the right to see your order but u can't
Very bad delivery experience litterly it shows arriving by tomorrow but it delivered my order after 3 days 72hrs of of the delivery date some the delivery persons r really very kind and good and best but Flipkart we need to focus on ur delivery a lot more than ur interface design. After using Flipkart for 6yrs and being a premium plus member it's my reward to get my order after 3 days from the delivery date. Improve ur delivery Thanks Team Flipkart
Youser experience is worst. Irritating software and the tracking was too bad to know the order details.
Worst service and user experience.
Excellent user experience. Should improve delivery
New update make interface lot more complicated it's better to use Amazon
Clumsy interface
Very few deals compared to amazon during festive times and also bad experience of app interface.
"user interface is very bad. I can't see sign up option, order cancellation etc"
"nice app, but the interface can be made better. please try to increase the cancellation time of the product."
great user interface
User interface is easy and simple.but return and refund process is very poor.i contacted them 9 to 10 times for return and refund .but they only extended their pickup date day by day. That's why I permanently do good bye😡 from today onwards.
Form last 2 das app was not open any products. Only interface showing. If open any product showing something went wrong.
great user interface
Flipkart app experience is very poor very slow response very poor interface
Not good user experience.. during sale I'm trying to place order on product page it is showing me in stock available but after clicking on buy now it is showing out of stock in just few sec. If product is not available then why are you showing available in stock to user's. Fix this issue. Help section is also not working properly.. something when wrong every time when I ask questions
easy interface
User friendly and apealling interface...! 😊👌🏼👍🏼
"I like Flipkart very much, its interface is very good, I spend 1 hour every day on this, but this does not rotate with the phone's screen, and does not work with split screen, this is its shortcomings."
Too much buggy interface..a lot of loading issues these days
Worst ai & interface I've ever seen buffer too much
Flipkart have accurate search and user friendly interface.

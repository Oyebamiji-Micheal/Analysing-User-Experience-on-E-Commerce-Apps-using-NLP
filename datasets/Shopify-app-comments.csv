"HOLY CRAP! This app is AMAZING. Installation was a breeze. The interface is INCREDIBLE. Super simple to set minimum quantities per product. I LOVE IT! IT LITERALLY took my LESS THAN 5 MINUTES TO GET THE JOB DONE!!!!!!
I did extensive research on other competing apps and I could not get past the bad reviews the others had. The issues the people had were really scary! I took a chance on this one because it does not have very many reviews. Once I seen the interface I knew that this was a gem. 
Bravo to the developers of this......BRAVO!"
"This is an amazing app! It works perfect with my shopify store.
Quantify is one of the simplest applications I have used, 
with a clean beautiful interface I can easily define my minimum and maximum product requirements.
We using this app on all 4 of our shopify stores. 
Thank You Team Quantify!"
"I've used this app to source all products from my store and found the process really easy, partly because of the user interface being super friendly, but mostly because of their amazing customer service when you do need help. I have to thank Ria from the Spocket team in particular, who was so quick, kind and helpful with payment issues I had on my end, not because of the app. My store has just gone live, so I will update this review as time goes by!"
"Seems like it works pretty good for me so far. Convenient interface, simple installs and did not interfere with my other tracking apps."
The interface is a little tricky but the Customer Support is phenomenal. I have a heavily customized theme and they implemented everything i needed. Always quick to respond and finding solutions.
"Une application à la hauteur de mes attentes et surtout Gratuite ! Parfaite pour ajouter toutes les variantes nécessaires à mes produits sans être limitée par Shopify. On a le choix dans les options et l'interface est facile à prendre à main. Bravo au développeur, je recommande vivement !!!"
"I have been shipping all my orders with shiprocket from 2 years. My experience with shiprocket has been amazing. The interface is user friendly and it's integrated with Shopify very well. I have never faced any major technical glitches with shiprocket. Also all the courier partners are available. Mr. Shashank who had been my account manager for more than 1 year has helped me a lot, be it guidance, problem solving or technical assistance. Ms. Kajal who recently became my account manager is also very helpful and always available on just one call. Shiprocket has improved their customer care and service drastically in last two years. I have tried other aggregators as well but nothing can beat shiprocket. I highly recommend shiprocket to anyone who is looking for hassle-free shipping experience at competitive prices."
"We spent a lot of time researching Invoice Apps to add to our Shopify business and Sufio was our first choice. The options of invoice formats to select from was a plus, but the Admin interface is what we utilize every day. We can quickly download past due invoices to send via email or print in mass as needed. If/When a customer needs a statement of account, we can quickly access their unpaid invoices, download a .csv file, make appropriate edits and send to the customer in seconds. Edits to invoices are also simple, quick and easy. Our business model requires we make minor changes to final invoices after items are sold and Sufio makes it very easy for us to make the changes ourselves. If we need assistance, Sufio's support team is fantastic. Quick responses, patience in understanding the issue and a genuine interest in helping us find the solution or alternative. Lastly, 65% of our customers pay for their product after the delivery of goods. For those paying by Credit Card, the Stripe functionality available through the electronic Sufio invoice makes it a seamless, efficient way to collect payment. Sufio has been instrumental in helping us grow our business and keeping cash flow under control."
"Simple, really smooth interface. I'm pretty pleased with this! :) Will keep it with the store for some time to come!"
"I can't say enough positive things about the Loop Return platform, it integrates seamlessly with Shopify, has several pre-built 3rd party integrations, and importantly enough the user experience of the platform is super simple for our entire CX team. Beyond the platform itself, the team at Loop is top-notch! Everyone we've encountered and worked with has been amazing and super helpful. Our account team at Loop always goes the distance (and sometimes beyond!) for us and they are always ready and more than willing to jump into and understand the details of our business processes to ensure that our customers are always having the best possible return experience every step of the way! We consider the Loop team as a true extension of our team here at Princess Polly."
"Love love love loop! I honestly don't understand why people still run returns manually. The is super affordable way of creating a premium user experience, reduce returns by converting them into exchanges, reducing customer service, and delighting customers. Five stars for sure!"
I have been using it for a couple of days now and it seems very good.  It has helped me a lot with regular publishing to the blog.  It is much better to work with Google Docs interface than with Shopify's blog interface.  Thanks.
"It felt good at first, but now it suddenly won't open. I do not know where it was wrong, its interface is blank."
Such a great app - the one that I was looking for a long time. Easy to use/beautiful countdown interfaces. You can also choose your theme which makes it easy to fit your store design. Would recommend 10/10!
"I don't like writing bad reviews - but unfortunately, I have to take away the 5 stars that I gave to netParcel 3 years ago. I now rate them as a 1 (ONE). Yes - their discounts are good (though others are lower) - but any savings I recognized from their shipping rates was lost many times over when the company failed to stand behind their services whenever things went wrong at their end - or when they failed to pay out insurance claims - without reason or explanation. I no longer use this app nor recommend their services. I have spoken with management about my problems a few times - they listen, they apologize, they say it won't happen again - but No corrective actions were ever initiated or taken to investigate, address or refund my losses. ********************
(MY ORIGINAL REVIEW : Rating 5 of 5 stars Posted April 10, 2018) I run 3 different Shopify storefronts and over the past 3 years have tried several different shipping consolidators / integrators. Have finally settled on netParcel for all or my business. The rates are the best, with a nice interface and great customer support. Thank You)"
"I LOVE using netParcel for my orders! The rates are highly competitive so there's no need to shop around, which saves a great deal of time. The interface is so easy to use that I've never had to use netParcel Customer Service! I recommend netParcel to anyone looking to save time and money!"
"We're based in Canada and have been using Netparcel for almost a year. We couldn't be happier with the experience so far. Best rates, easy-to-use interface and great customer support."
"The search is over.  By far the best shipping site I have found for domestic US shipping with THE cheapest rates and seamless user interface. I checked with 6-9 eshippers and hands down cheapest.   Quick Quote helped me size my parcels correctly so as not to get slammed with extra fees and the tracking history is excellent.  I have not used the international options yet but their FedEx US domestic rates rock.  The only platform I need and use.  Also, they pick up the phone and are helpful when I call."
"NetParcel has saved us loooooads of money with many of our shipments. They have the cheapest rates we've found online, and their user interface is some of the simplest we've come across. Their customer service is also top notch every time we've had to call in for anything. Highly recommend them for any business looking to improve their shipping process and save money!"
"App does what it says it does. Easy, reliable and reasonably priced in my opinion. User interface etc. could be prettier, but that doesn't really matter in terms of our experience with the app."
"We're using Fetch to deliver audio loop product files that are pretty large. Some of the files are over 500 GB. The reliability with Fetch is very good. Simple nice interface. Nice set of features. Easy to set up.
The customer user experience between Shopify and Fetch isn't as clean as I'd like for my customers. For example, Shopify isn't designed for digital downloads so customers are forced to provide a shipping address even though we're not shipping a product. There's a couple of klugy things like that. Over time, Shopify will likely clean those things up. 
We have some free audio loop downloads on our site if you'd like to run through the order/download process to see if it suits your needs.

"Good application with a convenient, simple interface and works perfectly with Amazon. Got several questions and support helped quickly and effectively - great communication."
"Worked first time without any issues, nice selection of graphics and simple user interface. Better value than previous seasonal theme apps we have tried as well. Also, the app developer reached out a couple of days after install just to check everything was okay and whether we needed any help. Nice touch."
"Meteorik is a great tool on 3 levels... (1) You can extract the data to evaluate how your store is doing. It provides easy-to-use filters, dashboards, and reports to drill down and compare sales, products, customers, etc. (2) It's also easy to segment data (sales, products, customers) and run reports or export it. And finally (3) You can set up triggers to automatically email your customers based on data from your store. So why are those 3 key points vital for the success and growth of a business? (1) You need to be able to digest the data relating to your sales & profits - the numbers. [For example, seeing who are my most/least profitable customers and what are they ordering most/least.] (2) Seeing clear data in reports is great, and sometimes it's necessary to export data to a spreadsheet in order to crunch the numbers and extrapolate sales data. (3) Being able to automatically generate specific emails based on triggers/events is golden. I've tried several other reporting apps. Meteorik is light years ahead. It truly shines in the way it delivers useful data. The interface is clean and simple. It concisely provides the information we need to see the big picture. If you're serious about succeeding in your business - look no further!"
"Metorik is such a well run reporting service from the greatest support team to the most user-friendly interface. Metorik makes reporting enjoyable, and connects seamlessly with Shopify (and WooCommerce as well!). If you are looking for a reporting service that can present your data in real time - with customizations and filters that suit your business, and sales digests straight to your inbox, Metorik is definitely for you! Also - if you are on a Shopify plan that limits your access to full product sales / order reports, Metorik will have you beyond covered with in depth insights into your sales - very much recommend this app!"
"I install it today and hoping to see some results. The app is very easy to use, it has a very easy interface."
"Been using Metorik already on Woocommerce, then switched to shopify and really been missing the functionality. Until... Metorik launched for shopify. Metorik is one of the smoothest interfaces I've evers used. Segmentation functionality is second to none. Automatic exports of highly detailed segments (customers or orders), detailed reporting on whatever you can think of, Engage to send automatic emails based on various conditions to customers or any other email (much more straight-forward and more detailed than even specialised software like Klaviyo) ... so many things about Metorik are valuable. And the speed with which Bryce and his team provide support, fix bugs and deploy features is beyond incredible. Thanks guys, keep it up !"
Metorik is fabulous. The insights are powerful & the user experience is polished. The support team has been extremely responsive and helpful to our questions. They care about you and your customers. Great partner for your Shopify store.
"This app is a game changer!!! I used to love Orbelo and was so upset once I heard they were shutting down! Then I found this app. I wasn't a fan because Orbelo had a simpler interface and I was used to it. So I looked again and found Dropshipman. It's a better version of Orbelo with the exact same interface. I was wowed. But after using Dropshipman I realised that DSERS was not only faster at importing products but was packed with features I can't live without. The interface once you get used to it, is simple and easy to use. I would recommend this app to everyone! Hope this helps make your decision in choosing a drop ship app easier. Take care Shopify peeps!"
Privy has been great for our small business both for e-mail marketing and the pop-up exit intent. The interface is very user friendly and customer service is always very helpful. Highly recommend if you're looking for an all in one e-comm marketing solution that is effective and helps drive your brand forward!
"Freaking awesome! I signed up for a trial just for the email signup functionality. I loved the results and decided to convert to the paid subscription. They do a free training/onboarding after you sign up, and they showed me the platform does a lot more than I thought it would. Very slick interface and intuitive. I'm getting good results."
App is easy to setup and has a lot of features. I had an onboarding Call with Daniel and he was able to walk me through and set up multiple campaigns. He was extremely knowledgeable about the interface and using all of the different features privy offers. Ive seen some great numbers already and look forwards to using privy to sit full potential.
"Wow. We had this app installed for 3 minutes before we realized it was automatically live on the website, prior to getting ANY of our Swatches updated, it was showing up on our product pages with only about 1/5th of what was needed. Considering we just launched a new line of products today, and our website had a high amount of traffic for us, who were now on a website that did not give them the proper selection of variants. 
Had they had a simple ""test mode"" none of this would have been an issue...and if they do, in my frantic struggle through the admin panel, settings, swatches etc did not turn this up, so there is a user experience failure there as I was unable to find a very basic button. 
Overall, this short frustrating experience has convinced me to avoid Webyze at all cost."
Super fast and helpful support. Great interface and easy to use. An absolute recommendation. Thanks Cristovam & Felix.
"App-idea is good, and maybe very useful in US or other countries. But it does not work with german passes and also not with german driver-licences. - A better personalisation and translation for the customer frontend would be helpful, as you cannot translate the User interface into another language. People must speak english. Maybe we are coming back in future after the app is more mature."
"This app is a Godsend to my business, great little interface so easy to config and most important easy for my customers, most who are elderly, Got stuck with the install (me newbie) but support was fast - Power to your elbow Tolu"
"Great app! So much easier than trying to code up my own datepicker. Quick and simple to install and options to set order cutoff times, fulfilment lead time and block off days manually in an easy to use interface. Responsive customer support as well."
"This app really differentiates itself from others in the app store by a) using a nice modal popup rather than a javascript alert, and b) in a conflict allowing the customer to choose whether to keep their current cart, restore their previous cart, or merge the two.
The interface for the customer could use some work, but I was able to fix most of my complaints with some custom css. All in all, well worth the price!"
"I love this app. I sell only digital products in my store and tried pretty much every app I could find. Downloadable Digital Assets was the winner by far. The design and interface is so simple and makes so much sense–add all of your assets (digital files) then attach the appropriate assets to each product. Boom done. I found other apps to be tedious and cumbersome. This one is super easy and super fast and every time I use it I'm relieved that it exists and that I found it. Also, the price is right."
Solved a problem that we had. Very easy interface and a top-notch support team. Couldn't say anything negative about the experience.
"Impressive app with a simple and easy to use interface, with a helpful array of options. If like me you are someone who makes a living from selling via shopify this app can make life easier. Smart that you can choose to notify previous customers of changes. Grateful also for friendly and helpful developers who understand the needs of their clients and go the extra mile with support. 5 stars."
"Updated:
Massive Monkey get points for decent user interface, ease of use and good free features. The big issue that i was facing, turns out to be partially Shopify's fault. I would have liked quicker feedback about this, an automated email briefly explaining the issue would have been enough. PS: your website has lots of social media links at the bottom that is supposed to go to Facebook, Twitter etc, but these are all blank links."
"The best app! Have tried several apps, this is the one I want!
Very good user interface"
"Recommended for beginners and advanced users who are looking for efficient CRM management and email automation solution. Metrilo platform was easy to integrate with our Shopify store, which gave us an instant access to our customers database, e-commerce analytics, customer purchasing behaviours and email marketing capabilities within single interface. In addition, it's quite easy to navigate, sort and analyse tracked visitors data to create more personalised and better targeted e-marketing campaigns. Lastly, it has all features needed for building your email templates from scratch (or simply uploading your own HTML) and for tracking email performance key metrics. Most importantly, you also get a decent and effective support via web-chat (either you use paid or trial services). We were so impressed with Metrilo platform functionality and results, that we've decided to switch our current provider and will continue working with Metrilo dedicated team, helping us to grow and deliver better experience for our clients."
Great app for the price. Not the prettiest interface but it works which is what's most important ...
We needed a simple and efficient way to bring in multiple metafields into our complex store - trueclub.com. This is an app that does exactly what it says. Great user interface and great support. We can’t recommend it highly enough.
The app works great and the new version has an easy interface. With some creativity you can do tons of customizations in your store with the metafields. In our case we add some custom fields for books information and adapted our templates to display these informations in a proper manner.
"I have research and tested the top apps in the store and this EXCEEDS them all. I have not found another app with such a complete list of benefits and features. In addition to being the app that meets all my functional needs, its user interface is sleek, modern, and very easy to use. As if that was not enough, they have an excellent support team. I spoke with Caroline who was easy to reach and responds quickly to all my queries."
very Good and Easy to install.... really quick and simple interface... would be recommending this to many more...
"Never seen something more useful than this app on Shopify! Suits my needs 100%. Easy set up, user-friendly interface :)"
"Easy to use interface and very flexible in setting up the points system. Customers love the shop earn program.
Great installation support."
"Tested all the affiliate apps and benchmarked. This is the best one in terms of - Branding (We could embed on our website, customised everything for our brand from logins, panels to emails)
- Full translation (We could translate almost everything to our local language with easy translation interface)
- Design (I think the design wise it is the best one compared all other platforms, i.e. admin and partner panels are very easy to use and more fashionable)
- Onboarding (step by step redirects you to - Level of functionality (there are amazing functions. The team considered all the details on affiliate marketing, you can even provide multi-level marketing where your partners can invite others to earn commission from their earnings)
- Pricing (very reasonable comparing the service provided) - Support (Of course, they are very responsive, they do their best to solve the issue as early as possible) Thanks a lot"
This is probably the best YMM app you can find for your store. Not only is interface super easy to use and user friendly but the support team is amazing. They always find a quick solution to any issue I may find as well helping me customize the look and feel of the app on my store. Strongly recommend this app if you are in the vehicle parts niche.
"Best one I've found for adding a year make model interface to your website. I love that it allows you to add URL's and tags instead of just products, and the interface is really easy to set up as well. Really worth the price."
Simple easy-to-use interface and well thought-through. Best of all it's free for as long as you want to try which helps you gauge the product.
"After 9 months of running the standard search widget there were a few improvements we wanted to make in terms of its design, function and position. 
The customer service and development teams responded promptly and worked on the site with minimal disruption. The worked requested was well executed with no need to go back and forth on e-mail. 
Having the successive (next) menu auto-open or drop down after a selection is made reduced the need for multiple clicks and improved user experience by removing any confusion. 
Highly recommended!"
Looks great so far! Easy to use and very clean interface. Looking forward to getting more affiliates onboard.
"Happy customer! The interface looks old but it's very powerful and easy to understand! Very very very customizable. Every options you want, it's in there. Customer support is super fast too! I have two store using this. No complains. Cheers"
"We switched from Refersion about 10 months ago, as Refersion's price was growing dramatically as we onboarded more affiliates. Goaff has been wonderful to work with. They're very responsive across all channels, they've fulfilled custom requests we've had and worked directly with our own developer to customize the entire experience. Tons of functionality, super straightforward interface, and very reasonably priced."
"It works, although I feel that the lack of customization (CSS) makes the user experience quite dull on both sides. I wish they would add an option for experienced front-end developers."
"Clean interface and Tech Support aren't people, they are wizards. Thank you for making what could have been a painful process easy!!!"
perfect app for qr code creation in shopify. 5 stars! thank you for the convenience and easy interface
"Perfect, does exactly what I needed to display the sizes/colours/number of each product and whether it's in stock at a glance. Saves the customer clicks and helps the general user experience of the website.
I talked to customer service to help me resolve a problem and they were super quick, and had sorted my problem within a day and even went above and beyond adding something in that I hadn't even noticed!
Would highly recommend."
"Very happy about the look and feel of this app! When I originally installed the app it didn't work right away, but it was mentioned on the installation page that it doesn't work for all themes so some customizations were needed. I reached out to the support team and got a very prompt reply and setup! The user interface is simple enough and I am very excited to see how my customers react."
"Their customer service is unmatched, not to mention the high quality of the app and the ability to integrate the review ask into Klaviyo flows. By far, the best reviews app we have used - and much less expensive than Yotpo (for a better user experience). 10./10"
"Super easy to use, clean interface for our users, and great customer support. Easy to install and had everything we needed, feature-wise (and probably quite a bit functionality beyond what we used)."
"The onboarding process was fantastic. We're still new to the platform but the Okendo team has made our transition from another vendor quick and seamless, and we love the program's interface."
"If you are a UK based seller and use a mixture of shipping services like Royal Mail & DPD, then you'll likely need to charge different rates for certain Postcode areas as the Carriers charge you different rates (i.e sending to Scottish Highlands). Shopify won't let you do this unless you are on Plus which is too pricey for most of us. Thankfully this awesome app allows you to set up tricky postcode shipping rules for the UK and further afield, the setup and interface are easy to use and the results are spot on. Honestly, we couldn't run our store without this app, its an absolute must for us."
This app has helped me focus our shipping by zipcode so that we can offer appropriate shipping rates to our local clients that we serve directly (vs using a 3rd party shipper). Intuitive and friendly interface makes setup easy. Their team was also very responsive to my initial setup questions.
"From zero to live in days not weeks! We moved over from another review platform and the transition to Okendo was easy, smooth and effortless. The tool is very intuitive in terms of where elements are located and what's possible. I had a couple questions during on-boarding and booked time same day with the on-boarding team to get my questions answered. We use Klaviyo for email so now all our emails look consistent and reporting is in the same platform. This is a great app with many options and a great user experience."
"Fast response, especially if you contact your contact person. It looks good and the interface for managing reviews is faster than Stamped for example."
"We have been using Okendo for our eCommerce store. The interface is very easy to use and intuitive. The User experience very smooth and their customer support very reliable, quick & nice! Recommended"
The app is very easy to use and also has one of the better user interfaces. I also needed a couple more fields on my reports and the dev had them added by the next day. Very responsive and helpful.
"Its the user interface that makes this worthwhile. Compared to together push notification options, these are visible, look great, and are easy to set up."
Such a great app for returns. The interface is super customer friendly and has unique features like offering customers instant exchanges to help save the sale. We've seen our return % go down and saved lots of $$ to people exchanging instead of sending back.
"We on-boarded Returnly to make the return process for our customers (and customer service team) easy and make exchanges possible.  The on-boarding was easy, and we appreciate how customizable the interface is.  We also find their support incredibly helpful and speedy."
"Implementing an automated returns platform 2 years ago was one of the smartest things we did for our E-Commerce business. Choosing Returnly as our Returns & Exchanges partner was even smarter. Not only do we love it, but our customers are thrilled over the easy exchange/returns process they experience. Streamlining the returns process into an automated one is already worth it with how much time is saved no longer having to manually manage returns. Add in all the other options Returnly offers like exchange orders being created instantly and the use of the voucher code to repurchase; it really allows you to regenerate business with your customers originally wanting to only return for refund.  The admin interface is user friendly and you have all the control needed to set up your products and policies the way you see fit. You also can make changes needed on the fly. Whether you want to set it and forget it or constantly update to accommodate business needs, you can do either. You can set up all the automated emails, customer facing pages, add your logo & theme and at any time can change whatever is needed. You have full control over what your customers see. You receive customer feedback on wording, or a policy, or an un-clickable link and you can decide to change it while still on the phone with that customer. It is that easy. Having full access and ability to manage the platform from the back-end admin tool is amazing. They have an easy support ticketing system for all your technical and support needs. I have never had a support question take longer than a business day to be resolved. Quick, efficient, super knowledgeable and friendly. Our account manager Jenna has been thorough in guiding us based on our business needs and the Returnly customer support team is phenomenal. Lourie, Selena and Aidan work with our team on a regular basis for different needs and we have built a partnership between their team and ours. Initially we had a more difficult task as we had to do a lot of integrations across multiple platforms as well as with our ERP system. However, the set up and integration was seamless, and we found that they did what was needed to set us up successfully through that process. They have a very informative Analytics page which really allows us to gain more insight on top returned items, reasons, and direct feedback from the customer. It allows our product development team to asses changes needed on products in order to correct any possible issues quickly.  
While our Returns Dept. & Customer Service team really enjoy utilizing Returnly and all the benefits it brings, I think we are mostly excited about how much our customers love it. Below are few of our customer’s reviews on their returns process. I wanted to share so you can see what an amazing experience your customers are going to have once you add Returnly to your roster. 
“You cant improve. AFTCO has the best return experience. PERIOD!”
“Best return experience on the internet” 
“This was very quick and easy - Thank you!”
“Experience was great! Received emails quick in regards to exchanging sizes. Very pleased with customer satisfaction” 
“You now have a full time customer thanks. It was very easy and appreciated how this was handled thank you”
“Ordering was easy and exchange process was quick and easy!  Thanks.”
“Easy to return!  No improvements as far as I can see. ”
“Honestly this has been amazing, so I do not know what you could do to make it any better. “
“This is an awesome way to assist customers. Very satisfied with the process!!”
“I don't think you can get any better than the OUTSTANDING SERVICE you have already provided me.  Thank you so much, and I will recommend you produces to everyone I know”
Thanks to the Returnly Team. Keep up the great work."
"We decided to use Returnly after a long summer of processing returns and exchanges manually. We are now saving 5 minutes per return/exchange. 
The onboarding process was very easy and efficient. We were able to make the website look exactly like an extension of our website, using our own pantones and font. 
The process Returnly provides for us is a much better user experience over all as well. Our customers are able to re-purchase immediately using their instant credit. Any time that we have had an issue or a question, our account manager gets back to us within the same business day. 
Especially now, in a time when our Customer Service team cannot physically check-in all of our returns, we are able to issue a credit to our customers automatically, knowing their package has safely arrived at our facilities."
"This app streamlined the returns and exchanges process for us at Talaria Flats. Customers loved the ease and user-friendliness of the interface, and the backend for us was great to manage and keep  tabs on where various returns and exchanges were in the process. Highly recommend!"
"Neat app and good support, works very well and the customer interface looks nice. The translation feature is excellent. I had a problem with selected quantity not transferring automatically to quote and the app support fixed that very quickly."
"very helpful support team! the easiest interface of the app and easy to use! there was some
glitch but i got help from support and they fixed it in just snap of the finger!"
Excellent app with very clear interface and settings. I had an issue with the button placement on my theme and it was fixed by their development team within an hour. Absolutely excellent service.
Best custom fields app at the moment! Simple clean interface.
"After trying a couple of other Metafield apps, Accentuate was the only one I felt comfortable handing off to clients. It doesn't (appear to) send you to a separate website, or require a fragile browser javascript plugin. The user-interface is simple and clean. That's very important to me. You can add metafields to Pages and Blog Posts (not just products), and fields can be assigned to separate blogs (so an ""Events"" blog can have different metafields than a ""News"" blog). There are many types of fields available, and the interface for building fields is simple enough that non-developers could use it easily. And the price is fair and affordable."
"(written by Damian, a web developer) 
Accentuate Custom Fields is absolutely brilliant. I honestly think ACF should be part of Shopify itself, it's so good. It's simple to use for the average user, but flexible enough to meet the needs of developers . 
I come from a Wordpress background, and for a long time have used plugins like pods.io to add extra fields to Wordpress objects. Pods is fantastic, so I was curious to see if something similar existed in Shopify-land. 
Shopify uses metafields to store data, but provides no user-friendly frontend to create or edit metafields. That's where Accentuate Custom Fields comes in. It lets you create all kinds of fields for a wide variety of Shopify object types, and provides a clean, no-nonsense user interface which makes data entry a pleasure.
Some of the field types supported include numbers, amounts, textareas, dropdown lists, checkboxes, files (such as images, or documents like PDFs) and colours (with a handy colour picker). There's also reference fields, which let you select an item from a list of Pages, Collections, and other shopify object types.
For developers, it's easy to display the contents of metafields on the frontend of your site with basic liquid tags. The Accentuate Custom Fields system was so useful I was able to build a pseudo page layout system for the theme used on a customer's website, which breaks each page down into blocks, similar to the way the Theme Customizer works in Shopify. 
Without a doubt though, the most important feature of this application is not the software itself, but the people behind it. The developers have been very proactive and even suggested ways to make my life easier, given the way I was using their product, and came up with improvements in response to feedback I provided. It's support like that which makes all the difference.
This app is a must-have for just about any shopify store that could use customization. And at the price point it is being offered, including it in any project is a no-brainer. Do yourself a favour and give it a try - you won't be disappointed!
Damian."
"Fully customizable, the interface is easy and clear. The customer team is fast-responding. Plus it's free! Sadly it lacks a little function I now need. Still recommend!"
"I wanted to remove all but one variant from a range of products but this proved to be slower than using the shopify interface. Having to go through scores of products, each with dozens of variants and physically tick each variant - waste of $26 - can do this for free and quicker with spreadsheet"
"Easy interface, nice color and size selection, shipped each order on time, no printing issues so far"
"Yotpo loyalty & rewards has multiple ways to earn points, understandable interface and easy to set up. The customer service is always responsive and patient when I met problems in the process of setting, GREAT APP."
"Basically a good app with a very simple interface that is easy to set up. Unfortunately, I notice long loading times in my store and the recommendations load only seconds after the page is already loaded. This is just way too slow and makes the whole page/store look very sluggish.
I had good experiences with the support, but they have no solution to the slow loading times.
I hope that it will be optimized because free apps that are so simple and good have almost none."
i lovethe interface of the app lets me find out each like of the customer what they shop for the most
"The app is easy to use, and there's a very good interface if you're going to use it to design shirts. The app could use more features to simplify adding products though.
I'm giving it five stars because of their prices, best I've seen for a POD service. I'm in Canada so, with the exchange rate, I really have to watch every dime.
I had to submit a support ticket to them for a small issue, the reply I received was outstanding. 
Definitely recommended!"
I used this app and its great . good support and the interface is great. if you run into any issues support is there
"Atelier sérieux. Interface fonctionnelle, support très réactif, produits et impressions de qualités et livraison rapide en France. Je n'ai jamais eu de problème avec. De loin la meilleure application POD que j'ai utilisé et j'en ai testé beaucoup."
"This was the first 3PL we have partnered with. We initially chose to work with ShipMonk because of their experience and infrastructure with Shopify and their ability to deal with mass quantities of orders. Their onboarding process was simple and a straightforward plug-in through the app store. The App interface is very well made and has some great resources for training purposes. We worked with Kerry who has gone above and beyond in communication and transparency. Their whole team of Happiness Engineers is a major highlight of our experience. On the ground their operations exceeded our expectations. We had 5 figures in order quantity, and they maintained an error margin of around .01%. All orders were fulfilled within 2-5 days keeping our customers extremely happy. Some minor things that we would like to see improved on:
Accurate up-to-date inventory counts after fulfilled orders.
A more straightforward ""assisted"" claim process for orders with errors. Even more visibility into the receiving process.
Quicker updates to billing cycle and pricing changes. Overall, we would recommend to any company who is looking for custom fulfillment specialists. Just be clear to set expectations early, and ShipMonk will deliver."
"Love Shipmonk! Fulfilling orders is seamless; my customers are super satisfied, and the interface is a breeze. I can see my entire shipping ecosystem at once. :)"
"I am giving ShipMonk a 5-Star review for various reasons! ""SIMPLICITY"" would be one word to describe the overall user experience and business experience with ShipMonk. They have made a phenomenal job at Simplifying the entire process from Shopify integration to receiving your products in their warehouses and shipping them globally. They have a truly dedicated and devoted Customer Service team to help you every step of the way. Their international shipping rates are attractive and that has been much appreciated by our customers. Working with ShipMonk has been a plain-sailing journey. ShipMonk has made it possible for me to run my business remotely from anywhere in the world which I am truly appreciative and grateful for.
Cheers,
Toulaish, CEO, Sleep-Bliss"
"We've been using Shipmonk (and their associated Shopify app) for more than a year now.
The onboarding process is fairly easy and they help you connect your store to their fulfillment center, and map the SKUs to their internal inventory codes. You can also do it yourself manually if you create product bundles, for instance, or they will do it for you if you have a lot of them, just by sending them a CSV.
From that moment on, Shipmonk automatically captures the orders from Shopify, processes them, and then inserts the tracking number once the order has been fulfilled.
So all in all, it is a very straightforward process and the only work you need to do is check their interface daily to verify no orders are ""stuck"" because the buyer entered an incorret address, or you have run out of stock of any item (which you shouldn't, as they provide a forecast on how many days of inventory you have left at the current sales rate.
All in all, very satisfied with their service and the timely delivery of the orders to my customers."
Great app to help to perform upselling and WITHOUT slowing down the speed performance of my shop!! Smooth installation without ANY problem! Clean interface and perfect app to use!
"A great solution for B2B/Wholesale Shopify Stores. SparkLayer is a great interface that enables a lot of functionality that makes B2B selling a better experience. Took a bit of time to get it set up completely but the SparkLayer team was always available to answer any questions/roadblocks that I faced. Overall, I would recommend this if you are considering optimising your B2B store experience"
"The app works as expected and the interface is very easy to use, without a lot of bells and whistles.
I had to have the app customized and a developer of the app did not let me down.  He optimized it for my Debut theme and it works just fine.  
The animation in the button is a great marketing tool to catch the attention of an interested buyer.  The animator also lets them know immediately what button to push if they want to buy the product.
I would recommend this app over all the other apps that do the same thing."
Extremely helpful at a moments call. Solved issue immediately. Brilliant delivery interface. Happy Customers.
"I can't stress enough what a game changer this app has been for me and my company. We were using another wholesale/bulk order app through shopify. That one cost is $100 a month and had the worst user interface. The EZ importer mapping took about an hour for me to figure out, but then I was able to save it and customize it as needed before each of the new corporate gift orders I had to upload. Its literally saved me days! When I have to import 450 orders here and 600 orders there and I can now do it in a matter of minutes with zero stress or tech glitches... I could cry with the relief! And the fact that you can import as many test orders as you want and then delete them without losing any credits is just incredible. It's made a massive difference to the learning curve of their platform and user friendliness. I'm just blown away. It's such a relief to find such an effective app but also coupled with their straightforward tutorials and extra user tips.. and its made my holiday season!"
Super easy setup and user-friendly interface. I also liked the various options that I can offer with these subscription plans.
"10 start from 5. The best APP in Shopify. We were able to create the massive configurator generating to our customers a huge bundle kit created from hundreds of individual components. We have tens of of individual questions in the product, each with up to tens of buttons (some with qty selections) (in real time feeding the product information like title/price and photo from ERP) with hundreds of additional divs with custom html content around. All together hundreds of individual elements in one product - each with its own multiple dimendional conditional logic. The same content running in customers browser our team uses also on their iPad just with different visual template for processing orders as it allows us to create interactive portable pick list checkbox from the huge bundle kit - always in real time synchronised with the newest revision published on the web! . The robustness of the admin interface is endless and if there was something missing (which happened few times), Roman was happy to offer the custom made solution. The app can do much more than its has been designed for when you have a vision and access to good front end developers. The app actually does not have to be used for product creation at all- that is just bonus. Thanks to the endless conditional logic you can for example create the UI of virtual salesman automatically guiding the customer based on his answers in helping making HIS decision or providing the required information based on the previous input (right at the moment when he needs it). Is the app perfect? No.. there is so much space for improvements in the admin interface that could make our work much faster and get us better overview on our project. The magic of this app is that you do not want to search any downsides as currently there is nothing like this on the market that would be even close of this app and we could not imagine to sell our products without it anymore. No matter how crazy your vision of the product builder is. This app will possibly do it. If you are prepared to spend additional thousands of $$$ for front end developers that shift your visual ideas into the reality this app can generate completely all content between header and footer of your shop and any smallest element in the product page can have its own conditions when to not/appear. This app will handle all the heavy work easily and the end result for your customers will be amazing."
"User interface is slick and intuitive, functionality is exactly what I was looking for, and the support is off the chart. Any issues I have had integrating DPO with my theme have been sorted out swiftly and competently without fail by Roman."
"This app has an easy to use interface. Once you get the data mapping set up, it is simple to import orders.
One downside was there was no way to pull inventory. Had to do it manually every import. After talking with Ralph, they set up a way to pull inventory automatically when you import orders. Very impressed with the customer service and attention given by Ralph.
Highly recommended if you are needing to import orders to your Shopify site."
This apps functionality has incredible depth yet it's user experience is simple to understand and use. Their support is second to none. I have over 15 tickets opened with them all carefully answered and documented. They do not stop assisting until issues are resolved. Trust this app for your product option needs.
I would give the staff 6 stars if I could. I use both EZ Importer and EZ Exporter to map data through Shopify to create invoices and automation scripts. These apps are THE best interface for mapping I've found.
Really cool app and clean interface for our website visitors. An easy way to tell your audience about events!
App unfortunately didn't have features I needed - but looked well made overall and had very easy interface. Customer support was helpful.
"I used this app to move our current manual process of processing returns via customer-service to an automated system.
I really like how easy the app makes this process. I am not very technical to say the least and yet the interface is super simple in customizing all the settings to our liking. We sell luxury products so we want to provide extra service for our customers with a pre paid return label which I could setup through the app as well.
Thumbs up for the amazing support that helped me with an issue I faced."
When I first came across this app I did not realize it’s full potential. It has helped us to create very powerful tasks which otherwise would have been either very expensive to develop or would have required multiple other apps. Mechanic combines it all and does so with an extremely easy and adaptive interface. But the best part is the community. It is super easy to find great help and post jobs if you’re stuck on a task. Mechanic must be the best app on this App Store.
"This app is pretty awesome. I'm a new Shopify user, so as I was developing my first site, I kept running into problems where I could anticipate little things taking forever to do.
I reached out to the developer, Isaac, and he was beyond helpful! As I came up with different things I thought could be beneficial, he custom-coded them and added them to the Mechanic template library for me and others to be able to use.
The subscription price that's based on your Shopify plan is unique in the sense that the number of 'actions' allowed in a month is unlimited for the one flat-rate whereas a lot of other similar apps charge per-action (which becomes SUPER expensive very quickly). As I was exploring other apps, some seemed a little more user-friendly, but much more expensive. And with the support I've gotten from Isaac, this is a no-brainer.
The only thing that I could hope for in the future would be an option for a bit more basic-user-friendliness. While I can completely understand the abilities of Mechanic being awesome for advanced users, those of us who don't know Liquid well enough to hand-code it could benefit from a WYSIWYG interface (where I could select from a dropdown menu 'If  is met, do '). This would be more similar to what I understand to be Mechanic's predecessor, ifShop.
Overall, 5 stars on functionality and service!"
The user Interface is easy to use with so much features that we need. Great customer support! We Recommend it!
Beautiful in it's simplicity. It is quick and easy to setup. Nice interface and works flawlessly. Great app. It does exactly what I need.
"So far so good, great user interface and easy to integrate with my site. Working like a charm so far!"
"I just installed the app and i found it easy to use, great interface and just what i needed to get my pop ups working in seconds"
"I was a little hesitant at first about downloading and trying this app. After reading some very positive reviews I decided to give it a try.
This app is AMAZING! I was able to quickly set up and format reports after only a few minutes of installing it. The interface is very user friendly and makes customizing reports a snap. I did have a couple of minor questions though. Much to my surprise (and delight) the Chat support was available 24/7 and was actually staffed by people that instantly knew how to solve my issues. (Note: The problem was due to my setup, not due to the app)
This will definitely be my 'go to' app for Shopify reports from this point forward and be my recommendation to anyone that asks!"
"Highly recommend POWr.io as they are very reliable, and you'll love their diverse suite of awesome apps. Quick and easy setup. Nice to have so many apps available through one app developer as the user interface is familiar. Support is second to none — very responsive when we have questions regarding new features, functionality, configuration and customization. Reasonably priced too. A few minor things we'd like to see improved upon in the future, but overall we are extremely pleased with this choice. Thanks! -EpiTraceSentinelSolutions.com"
"First, excellent customer support. They will help you build complex reports and scheduling, even things not available in the front-end of the app, so don't hesitate to talk to them if you need help. Second, this app is great for running reports that would be too detailed for the standard Shopify interface. This saves me hours of manual spreadsheet work every month."
"***UPDATED***
I WILL START HERE... I have had a very challenging experience with Teelaunch. That said, they have found out what the issue was with the disconnect between their application and my store. That alone has led me to change my rating from 1 star to 4. If I have success moving forwards, with minor issues in the coming weeks, I will revisit a 5-star review. Until then, I will be in touch and see how the application's interface works for me. ***I have been emailing back and forth with this company since October. The connection between my store and the application stopped working. They sent me instructions and asked me to send a screenshot. I followed all the instruction, and sent both a screenshot and a recording. Now, every time I send a message.... I get the same reply... that they have sent my request to a manager. I have sent a message today as well. I have had application issues before, but this is just beyond unappealing. I took the time to prepare several designs for products, but none of them will be pushed to my store. The makes things awkward, as I have prepared Items for clients but the items cannot be completed. I wish I had a great experience like other merchants, but here I sit disturbed and unhappy with this app, which I was very excited to you. I'm very jealous of those who could get this company to reply in a timely manner, as that has not been my experience. I'll be on the hunt, once again, for yet another supplier."
"I've used teelaunch on over 50 stores for over 4 years now. It's always the first app I recommend of all of the POD apps out there. It's super easy to use, straightforward interface, great product selection, prices, and print quality - and super fast and helpful customer service! Unlike many other apps, with teelaunch we don't experience stock issues or shipping delays - which is HUGE!"
So easy to use. Intuitive interface filled with everything you need and nothing you don't. Allowed me to fill out my online store with a handful of additional items that I don't want to hold in inventory. Keep it up!
Kickass app! Tested it works perfect. Never knew so many customers would be interested in the product if prices were slightly lesser. The user interface is beautiful and easy to understand. The support team replied back in a few minutes. Its great!
This is a hidden gem on Shopify app store. Super useful to built email lists. And it has a no-fuss clean interface. Also the developers are very responsive.
"I was hesitant about using the app at first. After using it, I found the interface to be quite simple to use. I amazed by how well the app automates."
"Good: Customer service excels. Replies were always fast (longest it took was 48hours).  Great variety of products. Competitive pricing. Very reliable app.
To improve: 
1. the user interface is more on the simple side, compared to the competition. You can’t edit products you created in the app, for example, it has to be done on the shopify side. Also the file has to be an exact size in pixels for every product or you won’t be able to upload. So if you wanna use the same design in 5 different products, you have to create 5 different files of five different sizes.
2. Talking specifically about mugs, I wish there were more size options specially for the accent and the black mugs. 
3. Also I wish there was an “all around print” option for mugs. 
4. I’d appreciate more mockup options on mugs as well.
Overall, don’t get the wrong impression. This is  a company worth Doing business with."
I used this app to automatically show new customer reviews our business gets on Google and Facebook. It is quite cool how this app integrates with our accounts on google and facebook and seamlessly downloads reviews as and when they are submitted and directly show them on our website. The interface is easy to use and it has added features for sending auto emails to seek reviews from customers once their orders are fulfilled. Very happy with the app so far.
"Unfortunately, I have to revert my previous rating because this app stopped working properly recently and after weeks of trying to contact the developer, we still hear nothing back, no response at all... We've just canceled the paying plan because we don't see any add-up value paying for something broken and can't be fixed. The next step is trying to figure out how to completely remove the code left behind. Because even if you disable the widget, you still see the error message on some pages, very frustrating... ---------------------
I'm updating this review because the support team has reached out and fixed my issue. Now the user experience of this App is worth a 5-star. I like how the review tab is designed and the fact it collects both google and facebook reviews at the same place. I would recommend you to try this app if you are looking for a simple but nice solution to show your google and facebook reviews."
Good and fast support. Fast turnaround and shipping on products I sell. Good interface and assets. Also open to feedback and improvement. Recommended.
Gift Card Hero really helped streamline our gift card process. There are many customizable options to allow you to integrate the gift card process from sales to checking balance seamlessly into your Shopify experience. Their team is very responsive and helped ensure from start to finish we were set up in a way that had a great consumer experience and user experience.
"The ABSOLUTE BEST Customer Service I have ever experienced in 6 years in the industry.  This is one Company that responds QUICKLY to emails.  When you have an issue they are on it.  If the first level can't help them it's referred directly to the owner who jumps right in to provide assistance.  There is no ""email fear"" of waiting days for a response.  It's timely and I don't think I have ever waited longer than 15 minutes!  The app is easy to accomplish and the interface with Etsy is a breeze.  My Print and Mail timeframes are certainly within 5 business days and with over 30 ""test"" orders out the door there has been ZERO quality complaints.  Through our follow-ups we have been looking for complaints and all that we heard were ""Very Happy"" and ""Would Order Again"".  We are certainly happy we made the change from doing our own DTG printing to Teelaunch!"
Very recommend to all shopify owners including beginners for it saves me loads of time on tracing order details. The app interface is user-friendly but at the same time also provide data in details. Some metrics i even never aware of them before. Nice subscription i get
Simplest app for showing sales and review info. The app interface is friendly and easy to use. The developer is very responsive for queries and was generous enough to add a requested feature immediately.
"I like that they have flags, as I've been looking for a company to print those for me. I do wish they had more than one size, and that they made outdoor flags as well, but this is good. I'm not thrilled that I can't duplicate a product and then amend it, so I have to enter all information from scratch for each version.
UPDATE: I'm really impressed with Teelaunch's customer service. I had an email waiting for me within an hour of posting my review, to give me information and see what they could do to improve my experience.
Learning that teelaunch makes all their products in Utah is great. They have indicated that they can offer other sizes of flags, and will look into it. The flags ARE of a quality that can handle outdoor use, however the recommendation is due to their being printed on one side only, so they don't look good on a flagpole. WIth this information, I can market my flags much better.
Regarding the interface, they are still working to add more ease of use and functionality, and they took my suggestions seriously. I really like to support smaller companies, so I'm willing to put in a little extra time setting up products for the level of quality and support they offer.
Really impressed! Changed my review from 4 stars to 5 stars. Well-deserved."
"We are a local store in Argentina with the dream of growing up and expand our business, but for most needs we had, shopify's lack of south american services resources wasn't making things easy. That was untill we gave Ship.System a try. After lots of fails by every other app in the shopify's market, Ship.System managed to adapt custom carrier rules to our very speciffic needs, and with the extraorinary support from Jonathan it has been faster and smoother than we ever imagined.
The App is solid in every aspect, even interface is very clear and friendly. If ever your store needs support for carrier services, Ship.System will be no doubt the definitive tool for you."
So far so great.  I'm part of Adrian Morrison's Student group.  I'm going to remove my on POD products from Printful.  Looking forward to working with you.  Easy to use. Great Interface. Great Product Selection!
"Easy to use interface, excellent product selection, customer photo uploads and so much more.  Amazing customer service as well!!!!! Thank you Chris and Teelaunch!"
"So satisfied of the app ! Easy to use, easy to custom ! Nice interface and chating !"
"Best appointment booking app: easy setup, the friendly user interface for staff and customers. Perfect features like showing only the next available time slot and email reminders. Customer service answered right away when i had questions"
Extremely easy to use without the hassle of trying to figure out how the app works. I have spent a few days trying various apps to find the one that was suitable for my needs and am very happy i found Cowlender. User experience is direct to the point and i was extended full assistance even before purchasing the app as i had a few questions to clarify. The customer service rendered to me was above my expectations and i truly appreciate the overall experience.
"Innercircle is an awesome App and solution for ambassador programs. The interface is super easy to use and their customer service is amazing! Thanks to them, our ambassador's program grow every day. Thank you innercircle team for your support and your first-rate App!"
"Funciona muito bem, mas é um pouco difícil e pouco intuitivo de configurar... Acredito que se melhorarem a interface de configuração será ótimo!"
"Search is the most important feature on our online store with 15k+ products. And Algolia is the perfect solution for us. The indexing process works very well, and the Algolia dashboard gives us tons of features. We used InstantSearch.js to implement a custom search user experience."
"Algolia is an amazing search SaaS providing an amazing user experience to our customers. We were thinking about building a search ourselves with Elasticsearch, but are now using Algolia to make 3M+ books searchable at shop.autorenwelt.de.
Matthieu, who is responsible for this integration at Algolia, was an absolute pleasure to work with - never before have I experienced such a responsive, thorough and helpful customer support.
If search is the primary way your customers interact with your product range, don't skimp on it."
App muito bom! As dúvidas sempre respondidas prontamente! Atendimento impecável! =) A interface poderia ser um pouco mais user friendly!
"bonjonr, je viens d'installer cette application pour synchroniser mes produits avec cdiscount, je n'arrive pas à syncroniser les produits. j'ai soit des messages d'erreurs, et sur l'interface de l'appli je vois toujopur 0 produits disponibles sur cdiscount, pouvez vous m'aider? puis que j'ai deja pris mon abonnement vendeur"
Jasmine is so helpful and I love the great interface and Avada is always amazing ever! Thanks Jasmine! Such a huge help!
"User friendly interface, amazing support team, and customer profiles log all forms of contact (email, phone, SMS, live chat) and order history, making it easy to review previous conversations and purchases in real time. Switching over to Gladly was a game changer and we’re so excited about the integration!"
Really great app - easy to set up and clean interface. I love feeling like I'm on top of my inventory (my shop has a mix of ready made products and products that are made to order using raw materials) and this app just makes it so much less stressful. I made a few suggestions to the developer and they immediately implemented it. Amazing! Would highly recommend.
"Ive been playing around with diff tracking apps for about 2 days now and this is probably the best free one out there. It supports much more shipping carriers than in the description, you can get the full carrier list through their API and I was pleasantly surprised to see many more carriers than listed in the description above. One downside is that the tracking page is hosted on a different domain, however, luckily you can get around this. They do provide a JSON api where you can get the tracking timeline, so you can technically create your own page and custom template in shopify and use the API for fully custom tracking page on your own domain. It would be better if the app just installed the template into shopify that can be included into any page, like many other apps do. It would be good if the app installed the email templates in this fashion as well (as part of the theme), so that they can be edited along with other liquid files via the Shopify interface or locally for developers using Themekit. For the custom tracking page, the API route is more work but if you're a developer it shouldnt be too difficult. Overall great app given for free, thank you very much."
"We have just started using this app. It provides the features we are looking for that some other apps did not have. We would like to be able to customize some user interface things better, but we have had good customer service with Jawad."
"Great app for gift wrap options. It is very simple to install. The user interface is very successful and easy. It does not require any coding knowledge. It really got ready in 3 minutes. Moreover, new developments are also on the way. It fits the design of your site. I'm excited for future updates!"
"Was a little concerned that this did not have any reviews, but figured with it being seemingly new we would give it a try anyway. The app is NOT free like stated on the app store, you have a limited number of credits and then need more, and additionally I'm not sure why this is an app at all as it does not pull your customers information from your store (at least not in the way you would want), it only will work from importing a CSV.
Not sure if the dashboard in the pictures is real as the tutorial video and interface we saw does not look like that at all."
"We just started using FAQ page. They don't have many documents to read beforehand but the instruction video gives clear guidance and once you install the app, there is a section to answer general questions user might want to know. The interface is easy to understand and manage. If you know how to write a blog, it should be a piece of cake to manage this app. We needed an adjustment to the app's search function and the support team was fast and sincere in responding via email. Thank you Donatas and Ernestas for quick adjustments and for answering all my questions!"
"Amazing. I couldn't find a theme that allowed customers to swipe through product images on mobile. This app fixes that which is great for user experience on mobile, so important these days. Thank you!"
"Two main reasons to use this particular wishlist app: 1. The guest interface is very easy to use. It's clean and does what it's supposed to, and it's never buggy.
2. Swym's customer support is on point. When I reached out for assistance linking the app to my store, they were quick to respond. They went ahead and fixed the problem for me, but they also succinctly explained why it was occurring, providing a link on what I need to do next time. No judgy tone, just being informative. (Basically, I needed to validate my code files after updating my theme.) I value that kind of efficiency."
"I have tried and tested a number of product personalizers to meet our requirements and this has not let us down so far, especially the addition of supporting photoshop files and layers really sets this APP apart. Once you get your head around the user interface, it's very simple to start making changes, There are some small issues with saving sometimes but nothing that stops this from performing as it should, overall i think the developers have created something with really great potential and i cant wait for the future releases. The addition of conditional logic would be a great feature as well."
"Great app, great, fast and nice support and definitely a plus for user experiences - in German and English."
"This interface is user-friendly. You pay about 4 dollars a month, and you can create good faq pages with several languages."
"After my previous gallery app got discontinued, I was frantically looking for replacement and came across Cozy Video Gallery app. Boy, I wish I found it earlier! Great interface, easy to use and I can finally bulk upload my videos! I store my works on Vimeo, not YouTube, but it works just as well; simple copy & paste and you can upload unlimited videos / links at the time. My galleries are big and having an option to upload tens of videos at the time is a true life / time saver.
Also, customer service is top notch - I had an issue with image sorting and they custom-fixed it for me in no time.
Overall, highly recommended!"
"Great app, particularly if you have multiple items and various upsell options. There are some areas where the User Interface could be a bit clearer / more intuitive, but once set up this works great. Also the support team respond very quickly and are extremely helpful (thanks Jason!). Recommended."
"I've been using this app for five years now. This is not a review from a new user - that's five years of using the app, tweaking the app. And enjoying it. First off - the interface is tricky. But it is incredibly powerful. And it just works. Zero downtime. To quote Ron Popeil, this is truly ""set it and forget it"". Over the years, I've had occasion to ask the W3 people for help on several occasions. Quick to respond, accurate answers. They've solved my problems EVERY SINGLE TIME. Sometimes it's a tweak to my website to get the result I want and they make it happen. I give them permission through Shopify, and for a very minor fee I get the result I'm looking for. If you visit the ""design your own"" portion of my website, you'll see their app in action. Great app, great staff, great service. Seriously. If you need product customization, then you need this app. Richard Ash

"I would give this app TEN STARS if it was possible.
I researched and tested all of the video gallery apps.  When choosing an app, I score ease of use very high, intuitive interface high but CUSTOMER SERVICE - as the highest factor for my purchase.
The app is great but the customer service is BEYOND EXCELLENT.  They were fast, professional and worked on a weekend. They helped us nail our brand customization colors and it looks so great.
Our client is happy and this is the only video player that I will use moving forward.
Thanks for the positive experience and helping us make our deadline."
"I've tried most of the Custom product options apps there are on the app store, and this one is by far the one that suited my need most. The live preview, conditional logic and extra costs on options let you create just about everything you need. The user interface is quite user-friendly in my opinion, and if you have any questions or problems, the support team is very responsive and friendly. It may require a tiny bit of coding to entirely customize some details of your own options, but if I managed it, so can you! Thanks again Justin and Megan for helping me throughout my journey :)"
"This app is really a winner. Despite a UI from the 80s in Russia, it is super flexible and most of all compatible with wholesale portal as the way they handle the cost of the options is unique. That is the reason I am using it. We have more than 400 paintings and 1400 variants. I needed an app to manage the sell of the frame option. Do not know if it can help others but with this app, I created first the master combinations (ex:40x40cm and 100x100cm to cover all scenarios of my catalogue of products, Then I created the 'slave' visual option for each dimension by associating a picture of the 3 different colours of my frames to a hidden product. By doing this, when someone is clicking ont he picture, it is looking at the correct frame dimension and associate cost). Trust me, it is just wonderful and it is the only app that was able to do that without managing a stock or creating virtual variants (that pollute you interface). To make it work, I then created the logics for the master combinaison saying that it must be display on each products page only of the tag XXXxXXXcm is use. In order to automatically add the this tag on the products, I just installed an auto-tag app creating a logic to use the variant name (ie 40x40cm) as a tag...and bing ! everything is automatic. It is still a good day of work to setup everything but trust me, this W3 option app is magic. So why only 4 stars on not 5 ? Simply because the support team just disappeared. They were amazing when I installed the app few months ago but recently I add an issue when we launch our website (critical moment) and the app was not displaying properly on mobile. I had to deactivate it (= loss of $) and after a couple of days without answers, I finally received an email that they will investigate...then no more answers to my 3 follow-up emails. I finally found the issue by myself as I understood the situation with them was hopeless (it was conflict with another app) . At this day, I still waiting for a message from them. I even told them I can told them which kind of app is in conflict so it can help others clients but they seem not interested. I was just hoping more reactivity especially when you GO LIVE and have hundreds of people visiting the website. So just be careful and double check with them first if they are available for your project. If no answer, you better have to find an alternative as you need their support to install (if not basic theme) and to understand the 'soviet' UI :) Hope they will get back on track soon and focus again on this app (indeed, I assume they are busy with new apps they released)."
"We have used Malca Amit shipping since we launched in 2018. It's a great app and service, fully insured, and we just don't have to worry about shipping. The team are great at following up claims if and when they arise so it's like having an extra person on your logistics team. Interfaces well with Shopify and the team are always open to software improvements as well."
"Exactly what I needed! Megan was helpful and responsive. I needed a little a little change here and there and Megan took care of it. So happy with the result. Update: Extremely satisfied. Upgraded to the 2.0 theme. It was a great time to try 2 other popular product option apps just to make sure I wasn't missing out, only to come back to this one. This one checks all the boxes. Easy to use interface for setting options and conditional logic, an output that will be easily understood by my customers. I opted to pay for customization so that it would show the base cost and itemized option costs and subtotal in a way that fit with my minimalist theme. Within 2 days, Gabby and Jason helped me install and code it to display exactly what I needed. The final result was worth the back and forth."
"The Shopify/Zendesk is an integral part of our business, we use it to have surface-level visibility into customer order history and details as well as customer notes while doing sales and support. The app largely eliminates the need for an entire additional window. The reason I can only give 4/5 stars is that there are a few features I'd still love to see, that could truly let our team work solely through the Zendesk interface:
1. If we could place orders within the side-bar app
2. if we could connect ticket numbers with the SKUs in an order created from that customer interaction."
"I've been using this system for almost a year now, I've used others in the past, I tried to get support from the other software vendors and they just didn't listen to my pain points, i also run a software company for over 20 years and i can tell you this, these guys give first-class support and they truly listen to your concerns and take action, they don't mess around. They have a first-class RAD Team and excellent support if you go with anyone else you will be wasting a lot of your time, the system works like a fine-tuned BMW, you want the best then you better listen to me and go with Autoposter, and it's simple and is easy to use and understand, the interface is well designed for the end-user and integrates to FB very easily along with TW, and Instagram. Good Job Guys!"
"The app is great, the interface is simple and the capabilities match the product description. More than that though, the team at W3 Trends was outstanding, quick to respond, went above and beyond and really came through in the end. It is a huge relief to know that moving forward a key part of my business will be in good hands with the W3 Trends team, and their awesome software. Thank you!!"
"I went through an extensive evaluation of the top 5 custom product options apps and W3 Trends exceeded my expectations. These apps are NOT all the same, and neither are the teams that deliver them. The app is great, the interface is simple and the capabilities match the product description. More than that though, the team at W3 Trends was outstanding, quick to respond, went above and beyond and really came through in the end. It is a huge relief to know that moving forward a key part of my business will be in good hands with the W3 Trends team, and their awesome software. Thank you!! Update: I've been using this app for 2 years now. I'm so impressed. More importantly, the customer support team is awesome. They respond quickly and help me get new features added quickly and troubleshoot anything that I can't figure out myself."
"Simple app, with a really good interface. Had a small issue with my instagram account integration, which was solved with the help of support."
"I have been using this app to sell toys on Walmart for over a year. When a new order arrives the buyer's name and email does not populate not even the Walmart linked email which is a pain since I can't search the orders tab for the buyer name and have to scroll through each order to find the buyer. Also Walmart does not allow any kind of restocking fees when an item is returned. This needs to change, additionally with the massive surge of new sellers on walmart we have seen a 74% decline in sales. Along with almost non existent customer service, and a horribly glitchy interface, incorrect payments and a total lack of support, I am about to resume selling everything on Amazon and stop selling on Walmart. As a small business, having to bear the expense for intake of a return with no ability to offset that expense with the buyer just doesn't work for me. Buyers are welcomed to just return things with no consequences. With constant marketplace issues, lack of sales due to a swelling income of 3rd party sellers, incorrect payments, and a total lack of support for sellers I would rate 0 stars if I could."
"This social proof app seems to be working good thus far, greatly looking forward to see how it helps my store perform over the next few months. Great overall back-end admin navigation interface!"
"The best App to deliver a great user experience to your customers...before Smart Search my clients complained that they had a hard time sometimes finding a specific product, now everything is more fluid...and the support, extraordinary, Nikita solved all my needs, thanks guys!"
"If you are looking for something to deal with any type of Shipping setup, this is the app to go for. The other apps are good but IS really gives you the ability to build out any rule that you like, add markups, integrate with carriers and much more. The interface is friendly but also really powerful and I would advise making yourself familiar with how rules are built and really plan out the logic if you have a complex setup. IS can and will handle it as long as you set things up correctly. If you need assistance, the support is excellent - personally I have gotten myself in a few tangles and always gotten a solution back very quickly with clear instructions. Highly Recommended!"
"This is the best shipping settings app I've tried so far. The interface is beautiful and their customer service is SUPER fast, patient and helpful. I would recommend this to anyone with specific shipping needs."
Quick response. Very flexible interface. Does everything I want. A+++ Will be using this on all my shops going forward/.
"Super clean and easy to set up. Most Search Filter apps are complex and bloated with code, or just ruin your store's interface completely. I'm impressed with the simplicity of CloudSearch, it's exactly what I was looking for."
Amazing support! We have just started using this app and the interface and intuitive. I like that it support meta fields and you can customise the filters to work for your products. We had some requests for how it integrated with our theme and support helped immediately - even customising for exactly our situation. Highly recommended!
"Very Good App for use, recommend everyone store to install and try it.
Very user friendly interface!"
"Incredibly helpful staff, easy to use, and very simple interface. 2 thumbs up!"
"The app has a very clean interface making it easy to navigate and use, so far its been very impressive and the support is amazing!"
Thank you for the help! SEOKart is a must have tool! Their communication is excellent! Great Job with the User experience!
"Really great app for creating more profit. Has several options to help set up discounts. I personally like the BOGO and Cross Sell the most, because they really help the user experience of my customers on my webshop. Also great support in case of questions and customization."
"We have been using this for over a year and it's AWESOME! Able to track Shopify, Amazon, Esty and Ebay all from 1 interface and any issues are handled quickly. It is a little spendy but it has paid us in spades with other 5000 SKU lines it's a breeze. Starting another very small startup and looking at others ONLY because of the price but if you have high volume and lots of SKU's then this is for you. Oh, also people who say it runs slow either have a crap connection or are trying to load 200+ items when they work. Their servers are NOT slow."
"The app is extremely slow - anytime you want to do anything be prepared to set aside plenty of time for screens to load, the majority of the time I spend in the app is waiting for things to load. Very confusing interface that needs to be revamped, looks like something from the 90s. Customer support doesn't do much besides create tickets, you don't get an answer on what happened. Even though it is an inexpensive app, you will be much happier spending a little more money elsewhere."
"I have been using this app for a few days now and it is working perfectly - unlike my experience with a more established Amazon integration app. I installed it, configured it in a few minutes and then spent half an hour or so linking my 600+ Shopify products to the same products in my Amazon store. If you encounter an error the app tells you what it is and how to fix it - unlike the previous app I used. The interface is much more intuitive and way easier to use. Tech support is great and quite quick even factoring in the time zone difference. Highly recommended."
"Very smooth setup and configuration, intuitive interface with all relevant data. Synch Shopify--Amazon works seamless, orders get automatically imported within less than a minute."
"I use ecomdash to sync inventory and create listings between Shopify, Etsy, and Amazon. I love the Inventory management and the ease of creating consistent listings among each platform. I would love to see improvement in the user interface and customer service.  The user interface seems a bit dated, and my customer service experience on their chat platform was not exceptional. The representatives didn't seem 100% knowledgeable on my topics and were in a hurry to end the session."
"Amazing app and team! I've been using Lighting Inventory for about a month now and we do all changes of inventory through it (adding stuff or removing stuff). I love the simple yet very functional interface and the dedicated team! Just stop looking for other inventory apps, this is the one!"
"I've been using creativehub for over a year now, it does an amazing job for artists who want to sell their work, print it, and send it to customers.
Quality at The Print Space is their major priority, and I have nothing but thankful clients when they receive their print at home.
Over the course of the year, I have experienced ups and downs using this app, however, customer support always has solved my situation, they are incredibly helpful. In truth, they are always improving user experiences and as every progressing business, there will be breaks.
Definitely, a way to go in Art printing and selling if you need a lab for your work."
"This is a brilliant way to being able to showcase and sell prints from our huge database of award-winning photographers. The design and user experience is slick and easy to use, and we've had great feedback so far."
An easy to use app with a very user-friendly interface. It solved my issues cleanly and quickly. The support team is also very responsive to my requests and helpful all the time.
"It does the job...mostly. It's simple user interface is great. That all works well. When there is an Error 404, it seems to update quickly. 
What we don't experience though, is that it doesn't proactively pick up all Error 404s. Our customers have notified us of a few that we've manually found. I'm not sure why this is. Hopefully it keeps improving."
"This is the best shopify url redirection app I've used so far, the predictive url redirect suggestions are saving me a huge amount of time each week and the interface is clean and simple to use. Just a great app, well worth the money."
"TomShaw.ca – Last month I announced my candidacy for Karhiio (Ward 11) City Councillor in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. I needed a donation app to further customize Shopify’s shopping cart interface so that anyone who wishes to donate to my campaign, upcoming fundraisers, or community events, could do so in any amount they choose. The app does exactly what it says. It is reliable and easy to use. So now when potential donors visit my campaign donation page they can donate any amount from $5 or $5000. Thanks Ben for your help with the customization!"
We are new to the app but so far....super easy. Great interface with lots of options to customize. Outstanding customer service so you aren't stuck dealing with issues on your own.
"Good user experience I had with your App. Descriptions are fantastic. Thanks for freebies, this given me opportunity to assess your delivery, will come to you for Title writing. I know this time it wont be free :)"
"This is a very good app to create Google shopping feeds. I think the app interface can be a little simpler. Some of the screens that you have to click through without changing any of the settings can probably be hidden, but I think developer wants to give user more control and options. I ended up reaching out to their support. The quality of their support is superb. They are very proactive in that if they didn't hear back from me after responding to my query they would follow up to make sure my issue is resolved. Now that is good service. Very happy with the app. Keep up the good work."
"I researched many Apps to build feed into Google Merchant, and finally, I decide on this App serve my global business. It is very flexible for you to build a complete feed into Google Merchant. Very Clear Features, and Easy to Use Interface. I really like this App. I recommend you to use it, worthy of five stars."
I chose this app because I love the appearance. I believe it is a friendly interface for my customers. The customer service is very attentive and helpful as I learn the process of setting up a Shopify store.
so easy to use better than any another ones with maximum easy interface and absolutely understandable buttons
"Amazing app. Super easy to start, clear interface and performs well. Recommend to any store to get more up sells. Works great if upsell  products that cost 30% and less than sold product."
"easy interface, easy to create. set up in minutes. and it was all automated form there. i literally increased my average order value from $50 to $75 just like that. And i must add, best app on the market for upsells. Highly recommend."
Very easy to use and looks great! Used it to push my sites user experience to an higher level. Very happy
"Really great App, It sits perfects for my use case and neat interface. Their customer support is really awesome, their response was fast and helpful. Thanks for the App!"
"This is by far the best Affiliate/Influencer App. I know as I tried them all. others were either far too complicated with too many gimmicks, cost a ton per month, hosted externally so taking people away from your site. This is where Simple Affiliate just nails it perfectly - great price, very simple and easy interface that just WORKS as it should with no silly features. Best of all its hosted on from within your own Shopify Admin making everything seamless. Big shout out to Customer Service too who tweaked some of the CSS for me so it matches my store. A customer for life and already reaping big benefits from this app. Thanks guys 5 Stars."
"Okay guys, im going to be completely honest, i have had some horrible experiences with apps of all categories throughout my time in business. But, simple affiliate, although they initially hesitant because of the small amount of reviews; i was incredibly amazed with how effective and ""simple"" this app really is. i have tested multiple different apps in this industry, and been disappointed every time. But, i cannot fault this app. This isn't just the best affiliate program app on the market; This is up there as being one of the most cost efficient, easy to use, incredibly supportive and nice customer service, as well as an incredibly easy user interface, that there is on the shopify app store."
"Very easy-to-use app, with all the tracking information of the logistics company I need, and the interface are beautiful. Recommended!"
"Fantastic app and excellent developer support! It works like a charm, supersimple interface and our request for some custom code work was addressed immediately by support team."
"This tracking app works great. Easy to set up, helpful app devs, and a really great looking interface. will be my go to tracking app for all stores movin forward."
"Available English and FRENCH version! We’ve tried a lot of inventory management app (OrderHive, Emerge App, Unleashed Software, TradeGecko, Zoho Inventory, etc.), and seriously, Erplain is the only great option out there for a small business if don’t want to ruins yourself and have a solution with good used interface and experience. At first we where worried by the small number of review (that’s also why we tried other software), but the fact that it’s also available French, the smart user interface, the support team and, of course, the price made it our #1 choice. Also if you’re searching for an affordable option to keep tracks of your items in consignement (if your a small manufacturer or designer that sells to consignee), this is the definitive option!"
"Gayet düzgün çalışıyor, ara yüzü basit ve kullanışlı, kargo teslim olduğunda sipariş arşivleniyor, işimi çok kolaylaştırdı. Şiddetle tavsiye ediyorum. - It works very smoothly, its interface is simple and usable, the order is archived when the cargo is delivered, it made my job very easy. I highly recommend it. Kenan"
"Is a good alternative when digital downloads app is not working like in my case, but I think it needs some improvements: fulfilling the order automatically, I'm having some issues with some payments from PayPal because of this and also provide the download link in the thank you page to give a better user experience. the speed of upload and download is really good!"
"I really like the UI of this App, including the part where it integrates perfectly within the Shopify UI (which is rarely the case for apps). Even customer support is built in!
It is very intuitive and it does what it promises.
I have contacted support (via chat) to help me out with a problem I couldn't immediately solve, they understood it immediately and promptly pointed me at a potential solution. On a Saturday!
I have given a few suggestions on how I think the app could be made even better, and this was appreciated and added to their roadmap.
In conclusion, excellent user experience on all fronts!"
"This is a really great idea and an excellent app. I'm very thankful to the Touchize team for this innovation and the effort they put to develop it. This is a very simple, user-friendly interface and it will for sure increase buyers' experience and their satisfaction. From my point of view, this app and the way of work it brings will become the standard for e-commerce."
"This app is sooo easy to use. The set-up and interface is so easy to use. By just enabling a button on the app the review section instantly popped up on my website. Customer service responded very quickly to my question and in such a friendly manner. Almost like talking to a friend. It’s obvious that they really care about their customers. I offered a few suggestions and it was received nicely. If you’re on the fence, get this app! You won’t regret it."
"I use this app since few days now and the interface is very easy and clear. I love the design and aesthetic of the widget it looks beautiful on our website, highly recommend Revieewer !"
The app is a lifesaver for online businesses. I’ve never seen an app that’s so easy to use. It has a very user friendly interface
"I'm amazed at the at the improvement since our last implementation better interface, better widgets easier method to display customer photos review! It is never been more convenient than now because it has a faster way of displaying your product review content on social media or your website! The support is also excellent, their response is always very informative when I need something small after hours. Highly recommend"
Exactly what I needed to have a quick seamless display. Very easy user interface and very quick process to install. 10/10
"Relatively easy to install and create bundles. The widget looks great on the page and provides an easy to use interface. Great support from the team, quick and straightfoward. The only thing I would recommend is getting a ""copy bundle"" option when creating new ones. Not a big deal to create from scratch, but it could save up some minutes! =)"
"Très content de cette application vous pouvez personnaliser l'Upsell, l'interface est simple d'utilisation et surtout ça fonctionne bien en matière de vente ! L'assistance répond rapidement, je recommande :)"
We needed the ability for customer file uploads. This app does the job easily and quickly. Support was prompt and a fix applied quickly for an app interface problem.
Very easy to install! Would recommend. No change to anything as this was very simple. I know this will improve user experience.
Its been a month we are using this app & we must say its great. This app reduced our workload of order confirmation. User interface is easy to understand. The support team is also very helpful.
"User interface is very friendly, very useful features like follow-up calling feature, Tags for COD verified orders,  Do not disturb  feature  really loved  this app"
"This didn't work for us, unfortunately. We used a tag based limit. I increased the quantity in the cart, got an error, hit update cart and it took me back to the cart without modifying anything. I was able to checkout with 4 over my limit. We are going with another app. It does have a very nice interface."
We explored different apps to display recently viewed products on our Shopify store This is the best app with a great user interface and flexible widget location options Their support team is dedicated and did a fantastic job to adjust the Recently Viewed widget on our store very quickly
Does exactly what it says. You can created rates by the distance away from your locations. Really simple User interface. The support is great as well. I couldn't find something on their support pages and they helped me and even fixed the support pages all within a few minutes.
"Great app, incredibly easy to install and to edit with a clean interface. I would highly recommend this app."
This app is really useful for setting up a quick gallery page for your shopify store. Very easy interface to use and also free! Will be using powr photo galery from now on.
"My partner and I have been using this app for 3 months now and are very impressed with the interface and customer service attached to it. Our Account Manager Keira is prompt, helpful, and very professional. The products themselves are wonderful and our customers are very happy with the quality. I would highly recommend this app for anyone wanting to get into the Beauty industry!"
"Things started off ok but quickly regressed into absolute frustration. None of my designs would save and I was using their built-in design builder (which looks like a limited interface with Canva - brilliant idea, but it's very poorly coded). Next, when I would try to create products the system would just stay stuck - FOR HOURS - on the ""Sit tight. This can take 2 to 5 minutes..."" screen until I closed out of the browser. The app is a good idea but it needs a TREMENNNNNNNNNDOUS amount of reworking to be anywhere close to a viable solution for an eCommerce store. Oh, and good luck getting a snappy response from support."
"LOVE, Love, love it! This is the 3rd app of this type that I have tried. I let the lack of reviews deter me but boy was I wrong! The others are unreliable and the user interface aren't as great. This was an instant install, it's easy to use and does the job. Highly recommended if your store requires minimum quantity purchases like mine does."
That app helped me get my gallery up quick and easy. Definitely recommend this for people that would like a user friendly interface.
"A great app! I found a way to sell effectively thanks to Teeinblue.
The interface and tools are very easy to use, with fast and enthusiastic support team."
"Great so far! Easy to use and simple interface, using for a few websites. Thanks to the developer of this app!"
"Great Plug-In. . it really helped to present Gallery Sales pages in a clear easy format.  Its quick and easy to learn and use - should be easy enough for even the inexperienced as the interface and menu system is so easy to follow.
Bit of a bugger to embed in shopify but thats down to shopify"
"So far so good, thank you for making this app free! It is really easy to install and use. Interface is pretty neat too, great UI/UX"
"The app is very helpful and so is their user support. We recommend this app for its user-friendly interface, so simple and effective."
"1st time at Shopify and man this thing is amazing well instructed and intuitive interface, just took me 2 minutes to set everything. Great app must use the paid version."
"While other similar apps use watermarks and such, this one doesn't - at no additional cost. The interface is clean and simple, does everything you need and the result is beautiful. Also, I previously complained that I couldn't change the language of the labels ('add to cart' etc) and they added this feature within 2 days! 10/10 recommend"
"Best subscription platform I've used. Highly customizable and has all the features you could want - split checkouts, custom upsells to subscriptions, great customer interface etc. I would highly recommend."
"I have tried so many dropshipping apps, and this is my favourite by far. They just launched thousands of products to choose from, and the best thing is they have local suppliers, whereas all the other dropshipper apps are aliexpress products. The interface is easy to use, and I can add products to my store within a few minutes. Very impressed with this and hoping to get some of these products in my other stores as well. I give this 10/10"
"PROS - FEATURE FIT:
My partner and I were planing out how to start a community/schooling system without needing a separate platform like Patreon. Conjured memberships exclusive page view feature and the ability to set that based on each tier within the membership is clutch. We were able to build out the foundation to a community school that is hosted on our site so we never have to drive traffic elsewhere and we constantly get members to return for their exclusive content. USER EXPERIENCE:
I'm not tech savvy but I work with a lot of people who are. So, I can speak it, understand it and follow along however, I can not code it. I have many years of experience working with a plethora of softwares and I can say navigating my way through Conjured memberships was seamless. CUSTOMER SERVICE:
If you're not like me and tech makes your head explode, don't have any fear when installing Conjured memberships. I'm on a very different timezone than the team at Conjured and they respond quicker than I can keep up with. I'm not trying to overly praise them, but Char is the person helping me out and every time I have a question it's answered very fast. I only paid close attention to this because I had made a pretty big mistake causing my site to have conversion problems. I thought it was Conjured membership related and I was pretty frantic so I sat there watching my inbox waiting for a reply and I know it was LATE for Char. Didn't matter Char was up and didn't hesitate to sooth my worries and help me through it. Best part is, the problem wasn't even caused by Conjured and Char helped me through it anyway. If you're starting a membership program and Conjured meets your feature needs. It is a NO BRAINER to work with this team. CONS - I don't really have any cons. I know it's a newer app and they will be rolling out new upgrades as they build so maybe that's a con... IDK in our case we are a pretty particular use case so most features may not apply to us, but nevertheless I'll be excited to see how I can implement them in anyway I can."
"Nice app with a beautiful interface. Also, the support team really knows what they're doing. Have had a great experience in using this app so far. Recommended!"
"This app is absolutely amazing! It includes all the best features from other membership apps as well as completely new features, with a clean interface and amazing analytics. I would recommend this app to any e-commerce business of any size. Well done Conjured team!"
Customer support from mobile: I did not imagine that it will be so easier to get back to our customers from Conzia mobile app. The installation was super easy as every thing is integrated with the Shopify store. The user experience of web and mobile apps is easy in terms of use and simple. I would definitely recommend Conzia Live chat app to every Shopify store owner.
"Data analysis way too complicated and time consuming. Enter [segments] where reports, metrics, visualizations, and integrations (that one would expect from enterprise solutions) but at a fraction of the price. Interface is quite intuitive, features actionable/key insights and easy to navigate for beginners. John is nothing short of amazing in terms of support and platform / feature set evolution. [Segments] by far, is the best in class and a must have to grow your business."
"The installation was very easy and self-explanatory. The user interface is friendly and I can select the color of the widget, online and offline messages, working timings. I can also add multiple agents/team members. Love this app so far!"
By far the one of most useful analytics apps. Super clear segmentation on the customers base with easy interface to navigate the platform. Helps us understand our customers a lot more!
"I like that Conzia offers to integrate Live Chat and Facebook Messenger on a Shopify store via one app. The web interface is very simple, user friendly and definitely better than the other complicated and expensive live chat solutions. I was able to put a nice looking live chat widget on the Shopify store in a couple of minutes. A mobile app is also included in the free plan which in my opinion is the best thing for a small online business to increase sales and customer satisfaction."
Conzia is an amazing live chat-bot for Shopify stores. The backend interface is very easy to set up. it took me five minutes to set up and integrate this app with my store. I have deployed this chatbot on my store for quite some time now and it works flawlessly. Highly recommended!
We use this app a lot to send invoices and receipts to customers. They have a great user experience. Great support as well. The free version works just fine for us. Highly recommend.
I really like this return app! The set up is very easy but the customer service is also extremely helpful. They go above and beyond to help you get everything ready for easy returns. The user interfaces very simple on the merchant side as well as the customer side. They also set it up so that it matches your website so everything looks seamless. I'm really happy with Return Prime!
"We discovered Return Prime a few months ago when we were looking for a system that accommodates both returns and exchanges. It was such a game changer for us when we were able to not only house returns and exchanges in the same system, but also create a unique user experience for the customer depending on what their request was. The customer service at Return Prime was very helpful in setting it up and responds very quickly with any request that we have. We would recommend Return Prime!"
Great support and nice user interface :) ---------------------------------------------------------------
"I have been researching the different ways to make an app for my store and I eventually landed on Drobile based on price, reviews and how user friendly the interface was. I haven't had a chance yet to see the results of having the app but Drobile has been exactly as I expected and support has been very helpful."
"10 glowing stars for this team if I could, especially Zac, he has been nothing but amazing with my app. Its rare for me to leave a review but when its deserved I like to give credit where credit is due. 
I can’t speak highly enough about the team at Drobile, they have been wonderful to work with. They got my app together overnight and even worked during the holiday period to get my app up in both stores as fast as possible. I don't think these guys actually sleep because no matter what time it is, they always respond very promptly.
The drag and drop interface of the app is super simple and quick to update which I can do myself in a few minutes a day.
Don’t hesitate, download this app, work with this team and you won’t be disappointed. 
Now I know why all their reviews are 5 stars, its because they deserve exactly that!"
"The application interface is clean and nice. It has some awesome features which are quite useful for a dropshipping store. By the way, the support is also efficient. Highly recommended."
It exceeded our expectations by far. The interface Its the best in the industry. 1M/10. Phenomenal.
Excellent rapport qualité/prix et service hyper réactif. Mon problème a été résolu en 24h et tout fonctionne parfaitement. Je recommande à 100% (interface personnalisable etc...). Merci !
"Great app. Very good customer support. Friendly interface.
Strongly recommended. Many options for drop. The best app."
"Just downloaded this app, but so far it's been completely seamless!! Their customer support is great, specifically worked with James and he was super helpful. The interface/software is super easy to use and understand. Highly recommend this app to anyone looking to add on a loyalty program!"
Easy interface and very helpful support team. Recommend this app for loyalty programs for customers.
"Very easy interface of the app. Customer service is great, quick response instantly solved my problems."
It's very rare to see an app where the developer actually has thought about the interface as well as how the customer would interact with the app. Combine this with a premium and blistering fast support and you have the only options app you would probably ever need. It's also a pleasure to see an app with full functionality on the free plan to allow you to grow along with the paid plans. All in all very well executed.
"Love it!! I've been looking for an app for my personalized items, and none of them, except this one, is suitable. I'm so grateful to the developers for such an amazing app. Friendly interface, tons of options and conditional logic, fast and effective support. Everything is perfect!! Highly recommended!"
Great app for bundling and discounts. Works as intended out of the box with an intuitive interface for creating bundled products.
"What a brilliant app (and even better customer service!) We've been using an exit intent pop-up on our site for a couple of months now and its been performing at over 13% conversion, consistently. There are loads of templates you can adapt as you like and the interface is super easy to use. The customer service really is next level. They answer your questions really quickly and everyone I have spoken to has been incredibly helpful and an absolute pleasure to deal with. Thank you!"
"I use the Blockshop theme so the application was not working properly with my theme. But the application contacted me directly by themselves without me even having to send them a message and they fixed the problem for me. The communication is easy, fast and efficient. We exchanged with Karol who in a few explanations understood what we were looking for with the application and the rendering we wanted on our site. This application not only gives a more aesthetic rendering on the website, but also a more attractive look and feel. As well as a much easier user experience.
I recommend this application 100%."
"Since implementing OptiMonk's exit-intent popup we've seen our newsletter optin conversion rate go from below 1% to over 3% in the first month. Our website bounce rate improved significantly and the average visitor time on site and pages per session have all increased. The interface is incredibly user-friendly, intuitive, and easy to navigate. The starter designs are stunning. The design tool is one of the best drag-and-drop visual design tools I've used. When compared to 5 other popup apps for Shopify that we tested, OptiMonk was the clear leader. Lastly, their support is top-notch. I've been able to have questions answered very quickly with their chat support. Excellent job!"
"Probably the best solution for popups on the market. Easy to use interface, nice popup templates, great support."
"Had a really good experience with this app. The interface is really intuitive and easy to use but the customer service was standout. We were having issues with proper integration (our fault, not theirs) and the team (Chris in particular!) helped every step of the way and went above and beyond give us some back end help to make the process smoother. Thank you!"
Very simple and easy setup. Simple interface and a nice first step for age verification.
Just amazing! We are an enterprise plan user. App's design and user interface is friendly. So when you are designing the app initially it is easy and intuitive. Great support from team to take care of even minute detail. We had to customise the app as there are some integrations which were not standard. Magenative team were very prompt to offer support. Must download for owners looking to add a mobile app for their website.
"This app has ended up doing what I hoped, helped me in easy integration and user friendly interface."
"So lucky to have stumbled upon Sesami :) It is very easy to use, so easy that I build my website in less than 2 weeks. The booking system is also very well thought out. The previous booking system I used had a very complicated interface so I am glad I made this switch. Thank you Mariana for the fast response and helping me fix the integration issues in less than a day."
"The Modalyst Team was always ready to support me while establishing our Supplier page. Many Thanks!
The interface is really easy."
It does exactly what it's supposed to do. Clean interface and the functions work perfectly. Thank you for saving me a lot of time! I was originally trying to make my own system to notify of low stock but this does just what I need.
StarShipIt has helped us save so time on shipping orders. What used to take up to an hour only takes a few minutes now. They are super helpful with onboarding and training and they are happy to help with integrating any shipping provider you currently use. The interface is easy to use and there are many options for customizing it to make things even easier for your store. Definitely consider using StarshipIt if you are looking to upgrade the way you process and ship orders.
"After going through a few shipping apps and not finding one that ticked all the boxes we came across star shippit. It is a cut above the rest we love it for pricing, accessibility, customisation and the interface is easy to use and looks good too!"
"Amazing app! Takes a little bit of time to set up, but once you have taken the time to do this, it saves so much time! Seamless interface and very easy to use. Scott has also been incredibly helpful and answered all my questions immediately!"
"Amazing service and really simple, effective interface. If you have an issue, EMAIL THE TEAM AND THEY WILL RESPOND!!! I wanted help with customisation and not only did I get a response, but my change was coded by the team into my Shopify within TWELVE HOURS. This is an amazing app with gold standard customer service!"
In the top ! Allows you to create an FAQ page easily. Very nice and intuitive interface. The team is super nice. I can only recommend you!
"This app has slashed the time it takes to print and ship orders (with shopify). The interface took a little getting used to, but the support in setting it up initially and then dealing with little problems as they pop up has been second to none. Now, we couldn't do without it. We thoroughly recommend this app."
Excellent and comprehensive app/website interface. Quick and effective customer service (thanks Anthony!). The website interface is very customisable and has tons of features and carrier integrations. These guys do a great job!
"Great and easy to use interface, with lots of customization options. Amazing customer service, really helpful!"
Very good app. Works as expected. The interface is very practical. I would pay a small fee for the app.
"I have been using Art of Where for a while now as my main artwork and bag/shoulder bag  supplier with hopes to use the service more often in the future. The quality of the products is amazing, the canvas artwork and day tote bag are really high quality. I also love the extra branding options provided through creating clothing labels, branding stickers for packages, and artist/company cards to insert in packages, absolutely top notch. I also love the fact that everything is hand made as much as possible and that everything is made, and the materials used are sourced, in Canada, something I truly appreciate as a Canadian shop owner, also having all the prices in Canadian Dollars has really helped properly pricing items. Shipping was fast and reliable and customer service was quick, responsive and professional and the creators interface is clean, easy to use and all the information and tools needed to create great products are there. A perfect print on demand product service (in my opinion) and I would recommend this service to anyone looking for a Canadian supplier in a heartbeat. Thank you and keep up the great work."
Wow great app! Loving the interface! Talk about a hidden gem! Please add men's swim shorts & swimsuits for women! Thank you!
"Absolutely amazing! The system works perfectly and for a reasonable price, the interface is much easier to use than other multivendor apps. If you want carrier calculated shipping I dont believe this has it but I may be wrong. However, everything is just plain amazing. Easy 5 stars"
The app is a must! the interface is very user friendly and customer service is prompt and effective. Highly Recommended!
Works as intended. Simple interface to use and allows multiple vendors to get real time notifications on new sales as well as an option to log in and track commissions. There are a few minor quality of life things I'd like to see changed but overall the system is very solid and the math checks out as well - unlike some of the other apps available. Support is quick and goes the extra mile
"The app does everything that I expected it to, and that's more than you can say for most apps. The analytics are pretty decent, and the user experience has been quite straightforward. If you are starting a marketplace and need a starting point, this is the way to go."
Finally my dream app is now on available. i was always looking for an app that can centralize all my stores in one Spreadsheet file and most awesome feature is Arabic language which make it a user friendly interface for me. Order data is well arranged using sections. Great work.
"We have tested many similar apps, and although Alpaca is a bit more pricey than some of it competitors, we came to the conclusion that it is superior:
-Very configurable.
-Great admin interface.
-Works with multi-language websites (did not work with several other similar apps)
-Friendly, efficient and fast support."
This app solves the user experience problem that Shopify doesn't have by default. This is a great app.
"Really simple and effective interface!
I  would prefer 2-3 more options on the design of the pop-up window even on basic's plan trial!"
"There are plenty of Youtube app out there, but I found this not only the most configurable, but having the most responsive support team behind. I am sure you all experience, when there is a great app, but having installation problem, due to the lack of support knowledge, well, you wont have anything like that with this team, they even helped me in interface translation. I can recommend them 100%"
This app has helped us level up our customer service management. The support team is great and so quick to reply if you have any issues at all setting up your interface.
Awesome app and easy to use! Interface was simple to understand and it did exactly what it said it would do. Super happy!
"We switched from Zendesk and very happy with the move. The Gorgias interface is far, far better, very intuitive. It's simple to create rules and macros, update them on the fly, etc. I was a bit weary of the ""pay by ticket"" setup but it's not that bad in practice, if you only use email. Though if you have busy social media accounts like we do, you will probably not want to use Gorgias for Instagram and Facebook comments. It just gets way too expensive. I think they will have to reconsider this at some point. Collaborating within Gorgias is really great for our small team, game changer compared to Zendesk. Shopify integration is just amazing, you have full access to the Shopify API data from within Gorgias. Tech support tries really hard to help, some of the best around. I have encountered a couple of cases with complex rules where their team got confused and I received different advice. But we got there in the end, they were patient and stuck with it until solved. Over the last few months, I have felt support getting better. I would 100% recommend Gorgias. I can see there is passion in the team and development seems fast and purposeful. There have already been some substantial updates and more coming on the public roadmap."
"Do you need fast and reliable syncing between your stores? Do you need an easy to use interface and amazing support? Look no further folks, a fantastic app at an amazing value for money cost. We do not usually write reviews but this is a well deserved exception. The team behind is extremely fast and professional, they helped us with questions/customisations. Well done and keep it up! Chris"
"It's great!  Not too deep. Simple interface and well thought out. Even my Jpn staff can use it. No documentation though so not sure about a few things about Tab Update""."
I checked many many products. All were available on Amazon for less than the cost through here. The interface is poor and it continually logs you out. Don't waster your time.
"A very good application with a wide range of product collections. This allowed me to create a wonderful store with a wide selection of products in a wide range of categories.
Very user-friendly interface of the membership area of the company itself!"
This has been one of the easiest installation so far to date.  User interface is simple but yet full of features. I would recommend this to anyone looking to spread the word of your business.
"Coupon Pop is a good app, and it does what it says it does.  On the pros side:
* Their customer service is great & fast to respond
* Coupons are very easy to set up with a user-friendly interface
* Easy to bulk upload unique coupon codes
However to make this a 5 star app, I really need this functionality:
* I am looking to offer a coupon for 15% off a first purchase by new customers only. Currently, CouponPop does not provide any method to ensure the coupon is used by individual customers only once (there is only a 2 week cookie placed on the customer's computer, so in theory, they could come back again in 2 weeks and get another code). 
They need to be able to sync to my MailChimp account/email list and verify that a customer is truly new, or if they have already signed up for my list previously (maybe track IP address?) I inquired about this, and it's apparently on their roadmap.
I've only been up & running a week with Coupon Pop and discounts are being redeemed daily.  It has definitely increased the conversion rate."
"I needed an app to help with managing pricing during a time of volatile currency fluctuations. Easy Sale Price has proven to be versatile and fit for purpose. Working with support during the initial phase and with sound advice on data backup, testing and planning, a straightforward approach is in place and easily executed through the simple interface."
Zach saved my day! He delivered above and beyond. I really appreciate this company for making a cohesive user experience.
I was looking for a page speed optimizer and page speed booster app and got recommended to try this one out. The setup is super fast and the page load time has significantly decreased after turning the optimizer on. It doesn't affect Google score but improve the UX (user experience) a ton which should still improve SEO since the time spent on page increases and bounce rate goes down. This is a really smart idea.
"Thank you Jumbo for making my website noticeably faster and kindly note this works well, it will definitely bring a good user experience. great job!"
"I love the interface, very simple setup and easy to use. Started to see my sales go up just after my first cross sell setup!"
"The developer doesn't provide customization tools to fit your theme. They also don't provide a clarification if this free app will keep the same features as the paid versions in the future. Further more, in my case this app only shows brick & mortar store reviews and not merchant reviews. Although the developer is technically very capable, it is a shame this should end like this after spending hours advising for the design and user experience."
"I have been looking for a long time for a catalog app that provides my needs when presenting my jewelry to potential buyers. 
Panda Catalog does a great job with providing an easy interface that offers great options to create a beautiful and friendly catalog - Thank you panda Catalog!"
Looks VERY promising. Only $14 a month to use both email and messenger abandon cart retargeting is a great deal! Easy to use interface too!
Slick user interface and simple to use!
"Having an estimated shipping date is critical to any e-commerce business. We feel the ""Estimated Shipping Date"" plugin hits a 5-star on multiple levels
- configurable shipping dates
- a simple admin interface
- great front-end functionality
- COD checking!
- a good price point for the value offered by the plugin
The most notable plus for us has been the phenomenal support offered by the developer. 
Highly recommended."
The app has opened up a lot of new possibilities for my business. We have rapidly growing revenues and we have improved our mobile user experience. Customer support is always extremely helpful and very fast!
I searched for an app to create a rewards program for my store. I tried two that was highly recommended but the features were limited and the interface was not user friendly. Set up was so easy and Praveen was attentive and helpful as I was setting up my rewards. I highly recommend this app to any one who wants to provide rewards and giveaways to their customers and guests.
staffy is just great! my user experience was great. I felt like I understood the app from the first place. as store owner that managing group of workers and need to follow everything staffy just helped me save time and... time = money!
This app basically takes bids for you. Love the interface and how easy it is to integrate into Shopify!!!
"Do not hesitate - hands down the best customer service I have received from any Shopify App developer. Fast and Efficient turn around, and willing to make small changes. Simple and Easy interface that does everything you need it to. Highly Reccomended"
"Been using this for a couple of months now and it is working great. Their support team responded very quickly during the implementation to enable some of their advanced features. The only minor thing that would have made it completely awesome are user editable rules on setting contact and sales account code that can take more then one field into consideration, e.g., customer tags and line item descriptions - we have quite a complex requirement for these but saying that their support team did manage to get quite a bit more than is in the apps interface implemented behind the scenes."
"Absolutely terrible. Syncing takes ages even if asked for manual sync. But when complete it doesn't mean you get your Amazon SKUs imported. I still have no idea what did they actually sync and where it went then.
What they successfully done was resetting all my inventory counts to 0 without even a single warning! 
And as a bottom line: nobody answered my chat request for support. Even worse, two chats I started was simply closed while I was navigating across the app interface.
Removing..."
"We are using this software for probably 4 years now. Owning a wholesale business, manufacturing our own product and some retail. I don't think anything else on the market would be able to have the dynamic features and capabilities for all of our needs. The integration with other software is easy and friendly to use. Very friendly interface and intuitive for so many complex features. Highly recommended."
The features and support for this app are top notch. We have been using this app for a couple of years and the features have been enhanced for a more customized user experience and brand centric feel. Definitely recommend them.
"I've used this app across multiple stores, and it always delivers. Super easy to use, quick interface for customers, fast upload speeds. I've linked it to Zapier so that I can fulfill orders really easily. Customer service is outstanding. I emailed in a question and got a response + fix in under 1hr. Incredible."
Im not writing reviews very often but UploadKit definitely deserved one. Repley within few hours to my request and solved it quickly for me. Its also one of the best apps for customers to upload files. I tried so many apps but the User Experience with this app is worth every penny. Thanks and keep up the good work!
"I was very excited about using this app since I felt the products, pricing and shipping costs were excellent. I only decided to delete it after I had learnt that shipping was coming from China. I cannot compete with 2-4 day production times and 14-25 day shipping times. The interface is easy to work with but once you create a design, it becomes final and you cant even delete it. (You will have to manually delete the product from your store). Overall, if your customers don't mind waiting a month for products, then this app is for you."
Easy and effective with plenty of options. A large selection of badge designs and a simple interface for attribute customization.
"Great app, and it has a very easy-to-use user interface. The customer service is excellent to answer the specific questions we have."
"Our business and website is 100% about offering our customers the ability to customize their products.  We've gone through several ways to receive customer's artwork and files and have always had challenges.
We have use various apps and tools to try and receive customer files via our Shopify store.  Our implementation was working but I always felt it could be better.  Thankfully, I keep looking for a better file upload app and ran across UploadKit.
The app installation was very straightforward no glitches, no code for me to write or insert, it just installed easy.  The app controls are also very intuitive and easy to modify.  I'd say that the app as designed would serve the need of 99% of store owners without any additional configuration required.
We happen to be that 1% that has very specific rules, requirements and design guidelines that required us to need the app to behave slightly different.  We use a lot of apps, some developers are terrible responders, some are average, some are great.  Toby and the team at Upload Kit truly deserve another classification:  EPIC!
Every question, request, curveball that we threw at them was met with a kind, thoughtful, quick response & solution.  Every need fulfilled.  The bar has been raised for other app developers.
As for the UploadKit app functionality, we are only scratching the surface but my initial impression is that it is very intuitive and has that perfect balance of features artfully designed so that the user experience is simple, obvious.
If you need to receive files from your customers, look no further than UploadKit.  It is the best option without question.

"Wonderful app and the layout is impeccably designed and allows you to customize your user experience. The pricing and functionality are superbly aesthetic and cost-effective for any small business. Product quizzes are incredibly important for upselling products because the reality is that most people don't really know where to start when making a purchasing decision. This quiz app is an excellent investment for a business to grow and scale in a meaningful way! Thank you so much for supporting our disabled military student mission at Assuaged.com and BeYourHighest.com, we love you!"
"Very useful product. I really like the user experience. You can quickly configure a quiz to make accurate suggestions to your buyers. The experience is very easy to configure and the outcome is very cool! If you are running an eCommerce store, this solution is a no-brainer!"
"Prehook has been a great way for our customers to stay engaged on our site and find the best products for their specific needs. We love how it can create a great user experience on our site, and help us grow our email list faster. Highly recommend!"
"The interface is the best out there, as well as the integrations and capabilities. It's super impressive.. I hope it will increase our sales. Will comeback soon to review again......."
Quick and free. I like it. Nice app and support is fast too. Just need a little simpler interface to understand it.
I love this app it has an intuitive interface and visually appealing design. i only am having one issue saving the delay timer for popup but i sent in a message we'll see how customer service is but so far 5 stars
"Awful app! Support is also poor.
Very slow down the whole interface. 2 giant buttons cover all Amazon / aliexpress / ebay photos - uncomfortable! Photo variations are imported every other time. After a while, the import stopped working. Poor quality app! I do not recommend!
Interface from 2000s"
"I don't think the app is the best functioning however it is the only one I was able to find which integrates with Amazon, Ebay etc. IT DOES NOT WORK WITH ALIBABA however and the interface is quite slow. I think it does need to be improved for $30 a month ...Rajendra's customer service was very good however!"
Great new app with lots of potential being better designed integrated into the shopify interface compared to others
"I struggle to get this app do work on mobile, On mobile it's Hyper sensitive to scrolling making the user experience unusable."
"We have been using Co-Op for a couple months now. The client management is very good and our account manager/support specialist, Lydia, is very helpful and communicative which is very important to us as we grow. The set up/implementation process was super easy and streamlined. We love how easy the interface/dashboard is to navigate and update. We have seen a few conversions which is exciting! We hope to see more now with the added transactional email function and other pro functions. We know it's relatively new so we are excited to see it start taking off and Co-Op coming out with robust functions that help increase conversions. We love the idea of the brand partnership and becoming visible to shoppers through other retail categories where we wouldn't be visible prior to being on this platform."
I didn't find a better app than this for my facebook pixels needs. Love the interface and straightforward approach. I can use it to add as much pixels and access tokens as I want
"Nice app, good interface and works well. Their support made sure my questions are answered, and that I am happy with their service!!"
"For Facebook pixels, this app has the most user friendly interface. The features are also all working as expected, the pricing is affordable, and a friendly support is there to assist if any question. I tried other apps, and I can only advise to use this one"
"The app worked the best for a few days, suddenly on one pixel it started recording multiple purchases(it was only on few adsets who were using the pixel, other adsets of that same pixel were recording correctly.), since the support was of not much help I removed the pixel which caused duplication of data on only few adsets.
Now when I switched to my second pixel, it worked fine for the first day & now its recording 2 purchase events on one single purchase only on few adsets & the purchase conversion value is equivalent to 1 purchase only.
I liked this app very much because of easy interface, but it messed up my whole analytics, even when I didnt made any changes to ads, or my website"
"This app allowed us to build a customer interface where they are able to build their own bike in 3D. Maël and team helped so much and always responded promptly and helpfully. This was a big project where we had very complex requests, but Angle 3D helped us complete everything we set out to. Highly recommend!"
"Great app for Facebook pixels management. It allows adding backup pixels to the store, and to use different pixels for different collections. The interface is simple and easy to use. It's pretty much the best pixel app we found on the app store!"
"Impeccable service, easy to use app with a great interface, I recommend 100%
The result is available here to see: https://gp-woodworking.com/products/handmade-pen-configurator"
"Angle 3D is the best 3D product configurator available for Shopify. Both the Admin and Public-Facing interfaces are slick and easy to use. App support is responsive, personal and extremely professional. My clients and I will continue to use Angle 3D and I would highly recommend."
"This company shirt sizing is too small. If they went up to 7XL and had better customer service. I’d give them a 5 Star review with no hesitation. The biggest issue I have is inaccurate sizing. This company doesn’t care to adopt American sizing; making the user experience somewhat of a nightmare. Most of my sales come from Social Media as a impulse buy. If someone orders a XL and it actually fits like a Medium. That’s an instant charge back and a lost in a repeating customer. In the “Terry Crew neck pullover” I have to purchase a 2XL because the XL fits between a Large and Medium. Same this problem for the T-Shirts which only go up to 2XL. Which makes ordering samples problematic and a waste of money. Also, that excludes anyone weighing over 210 lbs a non customer. When you try to contact customer support it’s a waste of time due to the never being resolved. This company could be great if they’d only listened to the people who give them business. This company is borderline trash juice but thank goodness my designs are amazing."
"As a pod platform is just awesome from the interface to the price all good but my gosh the team support is just non profesional , i ordered something in august ... 6 octomber still waiting for my order or an answer xD"
"The interface, product selection, and the generated previews are good. I can't write a review on shipping or product quality because they can't ship to P.O. boxes. I emailed asking why that was or if there was an alternative, but I got a vague response saying ""it need the details address"". I was excited because the app seemed like the solution to my needs but I couldn't even order samples."
"Great support, intuitive interface. Recommend to everyone! The YMQ Team solve my problem in minutes!"
"I accidentally deleted the app from my Shopify store and now it won't reiinstall, despite several attemps, clearing cache, etc. All I get is a page not found when it tries. I reached out to the developer through the link available here and no response after several days. I like the setup of products and selection, but it's a pretty useless app if I can't get it to reinstall after I oopsed it out of my shop. Getting this fixed would be a big help and change my opinion of KC a lot.
UPDATED: It was suggested that their response went to my spam folder. It didn't because it never even showed up. In addition, once they did reply, they called me ""David."" My name is not and never has been David or anything like it, nor anything remotely male. I'm female. They eventually did get my name right after they ""updated"" the software. Said update only happened after the original review. Note that I had the same issue with Teelaunch and they got it fixed within 24 hours. Upgrading to three stars because of the slow response and not bothering to ensure they were addressing the correct person. On the plus side, they get a fourth star because their interface is actually pretty slick to work with."
"We used this app to improve sales. The app is absolutely stuffed with features and offers a slick, intuitive and clean interface. Love it, so far."
"This app is easy to use, even easier with a computer. The interface for cell phones is frustrating but they do tell you that the app is better on a computer. However, with everyone using their phones these days for everything, a better cell phone interface would be great!
The convenience of the app in terms of being able to see mockups of all kinds of products with your design on them, then deciding which one to design is great.  Also, the option provided to do your descriptions and name your design once, and when it is uploaded to shopify it is auto added to each is cool too. However, I have yet to discover how to change the names of my designs once they are done, and there should be a bulk edit ability in the app to make changes to pricing, descriptions or sku’s, etc.
Interface between Shopify and this app is not as easy as Printful, but even with Printful, you still have to finish entering some info on each product, as is true for this app.  I would love to not have to do that. 
And, when an order is received, I have to manually send it to KC Custom, pay for it myself and manually add the tracking number to Shopify. Which is not updated by them, so I have to manually archive it once it’s delivered.
I love the variety of products offered and thus far I have not received any customer complaints about quality. I ordered a bag/purse for a sample and it felt “sticky” and looked not true to what I was expecting in terms of color, but not sure if it was because of my design, or my phone colors, the printing process or if it was bagged  before it was completely dry.  I ordered the slip on flyknit shoe as a sample and they were beautiful.  The branded packaging of both the bag and the shoes were really nice as well!
My biggest complaint I guess is with fulfillment times and shipping times. In general, allow two weeks from order to delivery. I wish it was quicker, but since it comes from China, I understand.
So my review is mixed cause I have mixed feelings about this app. For now, as long as they offer unique products as they do, and have great customer service, which they do have, and the design process is stellar, I will continue to use them and put up with the downsides to this app, but they would be so much better with a few app changes and faster shipping.
Ps: it would be great to see some Polynesian/Asian models, larger (Above 2-3X) sizes, all over print onesies, more children clothing and accessories, more dog products, mens button down, short sleeve and long sleeve shirts, and women’s long casual dresses. Also it would be great to have a choice of background colors for products, and a selection for mirror printing on items. Also, when you have to add another design, it would be great for the program to default back to the page with all tour designs, rather than downloading the design again. 
In spite of all if this, I love KC Custom and find myself designing like crazy!
Mahalo!"
"Great interface and customization options, I love the app because it allows me to even put in a coupon code in the header."
"Great app for the user experience, Tim's help was awesome. Everything you want on a gift card experience is awesome."
"Great App for a more complete user experience than the other solutions.
An extra star for the level of customer support. Super fast, super competent."
easy to use for all levels of experience. easy to use interface. helps boost listings so you get seen by more audiences
"The interface of the APP is very beautiful, the team is very professional, and there are no problems encountered so far"
"I used this app to make a mobile app for my e-commerce. great interface and speed, quite easy to use. though extremely limited customization. support is great"
"Very very cool interface and very useful app. It changed my store completely. But the best thing about this app is the customer service. They stayed more than an hour with me and they helped me customize the app to my needs. I can't thank them enough. My store looks so much better now. You show definetly give them a try, there are really no downsides to it."
Easy to use with great user experience for the end-user and provide a lot of design components that can fit different businesses.
"Smooth interface, easy to use and setup. Customer support is actually quite responsive and they literally sorted issues manually with the prompt response. Really happy with the service and the app.:)"
"Clear and SIMPLE interface, easy to set-up and very very quick support. Good work guys..keep up......"
"I'm pretty sure that at this point I've explored all of the app builder apps that are available here. I'd say there are two or three solid options, but Shopney was far and away the standout. The deciding factors for me were: - it handle our large number of SKUs and replicate online store theme's heavy reliance on subcollections (none of the other app builders can do that);
- intuitive and responsive interface;
- great value for the cost - every shop has different priorities, but some of the other options didn't make what we specifically needed available until a higher tier that cost 2-5x as much;
- really solid self-service help documentation;
- EXCELLENT and responsive customer service I'm so excited to see where this app takes us!"
"I am so happy I chose to start using the Yotpo app. It was so easy to get up and running and I got my first subscription within 24 hours. The team has truly been so supportive, helpful and responsive. Hannah is wonderful and I look forward to exploring other Yotpo apps. Thanks for creating a seamless user experience."
"Very grateful to work with Yotpo Subscriptions. Simple interface and excellent connections between SMS, loyalty, etc. Couldn't recommend a better company to work with."
The user interface is easy to use and update. One can do it by themselves or even use their customer support to get it in place. The customer support is pretty awesome!
Pretty good. I haven't tried all of them but this is definitely a clean interface. Wish it was a bit cheaper.
I love the Mobile App Builder and I hope it will improve my store's conversions. There is need though to improve its interface to make it more attractive. Thanks support team for tirelessly helping me setting it up.
Contains many of the features to specify upsell offers. CSS and design did not meet our needs. Mobile serves 100px images only. Layout does not auto-calculate when turning screen from landscape to portrait. Disabling mobile does not prevent mobile user experience from being available when shrinking desktop screen size. Had to use CSS to replace the 100px so limited to 1 campaign at a time. No campaign duplication option so we are just re-editing the original campaign over and over again. Please fix your app.
"This App is amazing! Easy and userfriendly interface.
Great SUPPORT TEAM."
8Upsell is a very useful tool for our upsell needs. It offers specific options that were not available in other upsell apps. It has a very user friendly monitoring interface with very useful info. I would recommend it.
"This is the way all apps should be for Shopify. EASY. With quick customer service. 
Not that we needed customer service. Initially, I couldn't figure out how to install it - only to realize that it was SO EASY that I didn't have to do anything. It was already installed and good to go. 
Interface is intuitive and a new offer takes moments to create. We've had this working for about 10 days - took us a little tweaking to figure out the best offers, but we've now upsold nearly $200 in the last week. Considering the price of the app, I'd say that it's a GREAT value!
And I just have to say again - Customer Service. It matters so much to us. BOLD has nice apps, but no customer service to speak of. I emailed support for Upsell and had a friendly email reply within a couple of hours. Much appreciated."
"PC terminal mobile page shopping experience. The interface design of shopping greetings, click to enter, you can enter the destination store web page, and then select the product to enter the product detailed introduction and evaluation content. Join the shopping cart, continue shopping, and then settle. Pay online. The design is very satisfied with a PC mobile phone operation interface app."
"Great app, using it on many stores already. The interface is very intuitive, and I see the new iterations have nice graphics as well."
"I used Metafields Guru to bulk add a huge amount of metafield data to my relatively large store. Even with over 25,000 products, Metafields Guru handled the bulk imports easily. The error handling made it easy to see where my data was a little off (eg I had some handles in my spreadsheets that didn't match exactly to shopify). Metafields Guru caught this and made it simple to fix just those items. The app interface is intuitive and I was able to accomplish exactly what I wanted. I appreciated the app's free credit system so I was able to test everything before committing to a subscription. Sasha answered all my questions quickly and the app works just as expected. 5 stars for sure."
"great app, love the interface and features. Support is fantastic, quick and very helpful. I've installed on all 3 of my shopify stores."
"Updated review 24/04/21
Changing from 4* to 5* following updates made by the developer, after reading my review and chatting by email they have updated the app and added a couple of premium features (which for the small charge are super useful) Great app, great dev :) -------------------------------------
Works exactly as advertised, the app interface seems to have trouble searching all my products but the link generation in the product page works exactly as it should which is more than enough for my use case. **BONUS Feature**
While not mentioned in the docs, the link generated works with you custom attached domain as well, for example if the app gives you. https://myawesomeshop.myshopify.com/link
then
https://myawesomeshop.com/link will work as well. I've dropped a note asking the dev to see if they can add this into the popup to save a little manual work."
"I could provide a minus 10 if available. My UPS account manager advised me to get this app to provide insurance to my packages. I paid insurance through Shopify, and now UPS is charging me for insurance. There is no interface between Shopify and UPS insurance. It is fraud and deception; after paying insurance via Shopify, they are also charging me insurance. I am deleting it. Store owners, be aware, don't get scammed by these people"
Clean interface and super professional support team. Got small issue with theme integration but Daniel was able to help fix in few mins .Will definitely recommend to everyone!
"Been using the app for several weeks now, on thousands of products on our marketplace shop. It does an excellent job ! It present multiple solutions to solve each use-case (single edit, bulk, and now Sets). It's well thought, technically robust, and the interface integrates pretty smoothly within native Shopify screens. The team is kind and reactive, which is a pretty good point nowadays. Looking forward to testing the in-product-sheet editor that the team just released this week"
"Great app, already used it on many stores for different clients. Easy to manage metafields and add the data, the interface is sleek and intuitive."
The easiest way to test different price-points. Easy interface with very easy set up. The app provides data and insights to educate decisions. Definitely recommend.
"Had some trouble to start as I needed to setup an account on an external website (Shippo), but Spice Gems came to the rescue and help me set everything up. The interface to setup was VERY easy to follow in this app and it's going to make a world of difference to our fast growing company!"
"Not good.  It creates a very easy top use interface for customers to fill out RMA requests, emails you the details, and then stops.  Nothing else.  $18.99/month for a simple email user interface?  
Unless I'm missing something, it's not worth $5/month.  And If I am missing something, it needs better instructions."
"Awesome app with simple interface and usage! A nice support was help me with problem very fast. 
Many thanks, you are the best!"
"Guys, I will be honest here, I had tried many apps for Metafields so far this is the best app you can get right now, also the support is so awesome they are ready to help you and they answer so fast, I am so satisfied with that app, it's so sad that I can give only 5 stars because this deserves more and it's totally free!
I use this app to generate all information about the products with JSON including picture video and all information, it's easy to update the template anytime I like for all products, also the user interface is so simple and easy to understand."
"Does the job nicely, has a pretty interface, rich text editor for big pieces of text... Overall great tool. No complaints."
Great app ! Does everything I was looking for and more. The interface is very clean & easy to use. Great job ! Really hope it's gonna stay a free app ;)
Great User Experience! I installed the app and created a metafield for Collections without any complication. I'd also like to see support for wysiwyg editor in metafield value field. Thanks!
"I'm a small (2 product) self publisher of natural history field guides (BYOGUIDES) who was badly burned a few years back by Shipwire. The combination of Shopify / Lulu has allowed me to relaunch my business without the hassle of warehousing and arbitrarily changing Shipwire policies. The Shopify / Lulu interface / model is not 'simple' to understand or navigate initially, especially if you are trying to distribute globally to small oceanic territories as well as the big ones (e.g. North America). So if you are not a web / developer type I would say you should find someone with solid Shopify store building experience before discovering the many rough edges. I would have rate the Lulu App 3 stars but for Lulu tech support haven been STELLAR and patient as we beat a path (together) to the solution I needed for my customers. I am seeing evidence of constant improvement in the APP but there are still numerous rough edges must navigated daily. For example: there are form field character limits in the Lulu world that are NOT surfaced to the customer in Shopify world. Consequently, orders constantly crash because there is one-too-many characters in a field. The SHOPIFY system doesn't tell you this so they need to discovered by manually checking the Lulu app after each order arrives and hand managed through by me and sometimes tech support. It's a hassle but it is getting better as time goes by.... I could go on esp. w.r.t. to having to manually set up multiple freight rates around for every country you MIGHT sell to - this was auto-magic with my previous solution. But the bottom line is that the system is viable and getting better and there is good support. But if your time is worth anything (or you want to go holidays and relax) make sure you partner with a developer with Shopify store building experience and focus on doing a bunch of test orders that mimic who, and where, your customers are - especially if they are outside the US and EU. Finally, Lulu printing itself, while efficient and of excellent quality does have format limitations. For example, a limited selection of paperweights such that everything feels like a coffee-table book when you might need something with more heft for practical purposes. Also, if you coil bind you can not get a straight run of pages and are forced to have a blank page at the front and back of you book. Otherwise great."
"Excellent functionality, intuitive interface, and responsive tech support. We are very happy with this app."
"(SECOND REVIEW - 9/21/2020): Production times are over a month. I have customers complaining daily, asking where their orders are. This is not an issue of the USPS or Fedex, this is a production/manufacturing issue that Lulu has faced since we began working with them. 
We get the same old runaround from customer service about how they are working on it. We have been working with Lulu for about a year now and it has just been painful from start to finish. 
If you're serious about starting a print-on-demand product, look elsewhere. It will save you a lot of headache in the long run for your business. Do not be fooled by Lulu's flashy interface and design. It's all smoke and mirrors. Behind the scenes it's a mess.
(FIRST REVIEW - 4/27/2020): If you are planning to start a business around selling books, be vary wary before jumping in head first with this app. There are issues with the app as well as print quality control.
We have been using the Lulu Xpress App for about 4 months now to print thousands of books. Our library consists of about 90 titles and we have spent thousands of dollars with Lulu. 
The app is riddled with bugs and issues. It is finicky and breaks easily. Many times it feels like wrestling a bear to get the app to do what it is supposed to.
Whether you're trying to view your orders or trying to upload/update a book, a new error or bug will present itself. The app requires various workarounds to avoid these bugs, but regardless a new one will pop up in its place, bringing production to a halt. ""Internal Server Errors"" seem to never go away. We hold our breath every time we launch the app, cringing at what broken mess we're going to run into. 
This is not something that a business can afford to deal with on a weekly basis. As it stands, we have not been able to access the app at all in over a week. 
We have been working with customer service to solve these issues. This is an additional problem in itself. The line of communication is not efficient. You will be in contact through an email support ticket chain. With this chain, your customer service rep will relay or mediate your issue to a ""developer"" who is ""working on the problem.""
It is just flat out inefficient and we expected more support and competency considering the volume we are producing and future plans of growth for our business.
To their defense, customer service does reply fairly quickly. They do try and it seems they are sincere in their efforts to help in whatever way they can. Unfortunately, they're dealing with a broken app. 
The backend development of this app has a long way to go. The errors and bugs shouldn't exist to begin with.
Because we are in this far, we will continue using Lulu for the time being, in hopes that they are able to iron out these issues soon. I will update this review once they do. Until then, I would not recommend this app."
"Lulu xPress is an application designed to drop-ship books using a simple interface to upload your cover and interior and quickly go on sale. It does exactly what it says it will do.
While there are alternatives, Lulu is a world class provider of books that is difficult to avoid when reading about publishing options for the independent author.  The interface does away with print ready pdfs and any need for human interaction when proofing a book but also makes the process intuitive so anyone can do it just like their more well known distribution options. xPress opens up their services to independent publishers as well with Press and the customer service of a long standing / reputable company already in place is really great.
This is a new application. Updates very frequent and we haven't had any issues."
Great app with all of the essential automations for running our eCommerce campaigns. It's also got quite a number of email templates that makes things faster. The user interface is incredibly user-friendly.
Just really simple. Doesn't make running my business any harder than it already is. I really like the user interface.
I found the interface very very easy to use - intergration with shopify worked perfectly - great support as well!
Great and extensive app with a lot of good features and interfaces. The new pricing model is perfect for small startups. There are some very helpful features to automate most of the workflows. Good documentation and customer support. Absolutely worth the price!
Great app with lots of templates and designs to make it easy to send out a professional looking campaign. Clean and simple user interface and lots of statistics available to describe customer interaction with emails and great customer support. Integration with Shopify was simple and seamless. And their free email plan is an ongoing plan and is not a trial so there are options for all sizes of business. Highly Recommend this product.
Excellent customer service - and instant response on chat and took care of my query right away. I have enjoyed using the app so far - very easy to use and a great interface. I will recommend it highly to others!
Great support and easy interface. Thank you Lance. Great chatting with you and I appreciate all the support!
"We found this app, and right from the start, it was almost perfect. The interface is clean, modern, easy to use, and it even incorporates audible feedback. The only feature that was missing was the ability to tag who checked each order. We messaged support, and within less than 24 hours, Paul replied and added a feature which allows each order to be tagged based on the device of a user. Each user will need a separate device, but this is perfect to help us keep track of who is packing an order. We simply input the name of each packer, and it will tag the order as ""Checked by [Name]"". Thank you for the excellent support and response time!"
"Hi Support,
I am going to write a review and I thought I should send it to you first so that you can prompt me with anything I may have missed. I genuinely believe you have done the best you can for me. I feel there should be more advice for beginners like me when considering using Channel Unity.
Case: 3 person team, 1 beginner, managing Channel Unity for linking shopify to ebay UK and amazon UK (other countries have been disabled due to the pitfalls of beginners experience)
All comments are intended to be used as constructive advice for those looking to use Channel Unity with beginners experience. 
Summary: pay someone to use Channel Unity for you as you won't have the time to figure it out.
Initially, I was sold this fantastic product with the understanding from the salesman that everything was easy and self managing. I am sure this is true for those who are experts in eCommerce and understand how everything works. The team were very helpful in the beginning to help set up basic use. Support continue to be helpful under time restrictions (offer little examination of core issues) and with up to 2 weeks delayed response. We tend to go around in circles over the same problems that keep coming up. Advice is worded for like-minded experts who have a strong understanding of eCommerce so it is not suitable for newcomers (unavailable time is spent trying to act on advice). N.B pay an expert to manage it for you.
Ebay: These points will be obvious to experienced eCommerce managers but are not currently illustrated anywhere I can find for beginners. Everyday 100's and sometimes 1000's of listings have to be deleted from eBay as they are flagged, 'fix required'. If they are not deleted, listings loose their link and you will miss the orders as they won't we sent to your 3rd party tool (eg. shopify). This makes it hard to build trust with customers. Some of the 'fix required' are explainable through changing (developing) products in shopify (unavoidable through ebay listing restrictions). Advice: create listings as a finished product rather than with changes in mind as there's no room for error. You can delete products manually from Ebay as you go but you're often pulled away on other operational tasks and loose the thread of that particular task. Also, check each platform directly, everyday to monitor missed orders as you cannot rely on Channel Unity to send all orders to Shopify if you have made changes and forgotten to delete them from eBay. Deleting listings means that every time you relist them they loose their metrics (history of successful orders) and the listing goes to the back of the visibility cue. I had to find this out the hard way. N.B pay an expert to run it for you
Amazon: Listings are created in ways that are hard to search for, find and use in the competitive market. Listings loose their links so you have to look at amazon everyday to make sure you don't miss orders. Inventory management is difficult when links are lost as it's hard to filter unlinked listings from linked listings. 
Amazon's way of doing things often clash with ebay's methods. For example, Amazon cannot cope with many variations per listing. So, if you are using one source (Shopify) to link to ebay and amazon there's a lot more to consider when designing your website N.B. hire an expert
Conclusion: Channel Unity are the only stitching service that link shopify to Amazon so, 'like it or lump it', if you want to link to Amazon. However, shopify do provide this service in America and are looking to enable it in UK. There are alternative stitching companies that generate more turnover, provide a more user friendly/ easier to use interface than using Channel Unity to link with Ebay.
I hope this feedback will help your development and marketing team
Kind Regards,

Hi Sam,
Thanks very much for sending across your review prior to publishing. There’s clearly a lot of thought and time gone in to that and it’s extremely useful having that kind of feedback. I suppose that my main goal is to ensure that we respond appropriately to this kind of feedback by focussing on how we ensure that customers who start in the position that you did do not end up feeling as you do now. You starting point is quite a rare one, your product set is relatively large, at the more complex end of the spectrum as far as marketplaces go and your own knowledge was of a beginner, as you describe. Whilst it’s rare, it’s still my goal to ensure that we suitably cater for people in that position by giving them the heads up on how much there is to learn and a suitable alternative to needing to do that if they would prefer to pay us to manage the account for them.
Some of the points that you’ve raised have obvious answers that we can get in place in very short order, which I’m sure will help customers that start where you did. Some of the points that you raise, I’d like a bit more clarification on before determining how we can best respond to them. I’ve just detailed these key points and discussed in an improptu Support Team Meeting:
1) You make a general point a number of times that for someone in your position with time limitations it may be best to have someone managing ChannelUnity for you. We’ve already started offering customers managed setup/ongoing managed services and part of that onboarding process is now to determine whether a customer would prefer to learn about marketplaces for themselves or to engage us to manage their marketplaces sales. 
2) You didn’t have access to enough material detailing some of the marketplace specific information that would have prevented some of the issues that you’ve had. This is great feedback and as a result we’ll be putting together beginners guides for each marketplace, to be completed and highlighted to customers at the point that they connect a new marketplace. I won’t detail them all because this email will be long enough as it is but you’ve given loads of great examples which we can document so thanks for highlighting that.
3) You note that support continue to be helpful but offer little examination of core issues due to time retrictions. Could you give me a bit more detail about what you mean here? The support time expectations of smaller customers is one of the topics we discuss internally most frequently, but we’ve not yet put any kind of limit on the amount of ChannelUnity support which is available before additional support payments are required. I gather than in some cases the support that you have required is not with ChannelUnity but with the marketplace itself, an area where we would draw the line at the moment although as I understand it, it may only have been this week that you were offered the opportunity to pay for additional support if you’d prefer our team to complete something outside of the scope of our support.
4) You mention up to a 2 week delay in reponse from our support team which doesn’t feel right, is a million miles from what the average CU customer expects/receives and doesn’t seem fair in your case when looking at the stats - your tickets have been responded to in an average time of 1.5 hours. Could you give me some more info as to what you’re referring to here as I’d really like to understand it more?
5) You note that you feel that support responses are worded in a way that is beyond what the average beginner might be expected to understand, and that as a result you feel like the same issues keep on coming up as they are not properly resolved. Could you give me some examples here please? This is so far from the feedback that we get from other customers in your position that I’m struggling to reconcile it and having had a look at a couple of your tickets at random I’ve not seen any sign of what you describe. You mention that you are pushed for time, I wonder how much of this is related to the time that it will take you to follow the advice is given and how much is the advice itself? Really I just want to understand this one more, with specific examples where appropriate.
6) You mention that 100s/1000s listings fall into ‘Fix Required’ on a daily basis and that if not resolved these become unlinked. Isn't a fair reflection for the average customer but I do understand that this has affected you given some of the things you’ve been changing (which have been prevented with these guides). I understand that the issue that keeps cropping up in relation to this is that you are changing variation specifics, which eBay will not allow so hopefully we can cover that in the guide and also create a ChannelUnity warning when this is attempted so that the results are understood. I also understand that during your time with ChannelUnity to date there was a specific issue which created more problems here which has subsequently been resolved. The de-linking of products is something that should never happen and we are not aware of any examples of this on either Amazon or eBay. Do you have a ticket reference that I can look into further? Items falling into fix required will remain linked indefinitely so I can’t reconcile your report in relation to products become unlinked and would like to look into this further.
7) You report that you need to check Amazon/eBay daily for orders which may not have been processed. I can’t understand this one. Regardless of whether a product is linked or not, we will receive order data from the marketplace and try to pass to Shopify, where this is unsuccessful in being processed for any reason an error automatically logs a ticket informing both you the customer and our support team of the issue. This is frequently reported to us as a key benefit of ChannelUnity over other competitors so I’d really like some more info on instances in which you have needed pick up orders that haven’t been treated in this way so that I can look into it further.
8) You mention that Amazon listings are created in a way that are hard to find/search for. ChannelUnity will list them in the way that you ask it to. If you map a product title that is hard to find then it will be hard to find. I think that there’s a big benefit to adding some information on Amazon search optimisation to the Amazon Beginners Guide that we’ll produce. For customers who have the time and want to do their own research to optimise their listings this would help them, for those that want to pay ChannelUnity to manage that on their behalf we have the managed services I’ve previously mentioned. Had those two options existed do you think that would have given you a suitable way forward with this one?
9) Your conclusion is factually incorrect, ChannelUnity is not the only stiching service available. You are correct that Shopify has released its own integrations. Over 50% of our customers are based in the US, the vast majority of customers using Shopify have not deemed the Shopify services to meet their needs, those that have tried it out have moved straight back.
10) You mention the need for a more user friendly interface. I totally agree with you here and work is in progress at the moment to complete the next phase of our interface development, intended to dramtically reduce the amount of ‘clicks’ that a customer need complete and bring more error reporting into ChannelUnity before errors are received from the marketplaces.
11) You mention other stitching companies that generate more revenue. I’d love to understand what features you feel are responsible for that. It always useful to know where others may be ahead of where we are.
Thanks again for the feedback. I don’t want to take your time up needing a written response to this. Would there be a good time to catch up on the phone quickly on it which I’m sure will be much quicker.
Thanks
Matt

"IT DOESN'T DO WHAT IT SAYS, FOUND A BETTER APP
Started using Connectr app because it advertised that it would sync inventory between Amazon and Shopify. Just be clear, it only syncs changes in inventory that come from orders and changes made in seller central. If you receive inventory and adjust inventory levels in Shopify, they will be overwritten by the inventory in seller central. So the product does not actually sync FBM inventory between AMZ and Shopify. It only syncs some of the inventory. The interface is very confusing and hard to understand and there is a high risk of accidentally overwriting inventory numbers and products. There is just to much to risk when using this app as it will cause you a lot of time fixing what they did. My staff had to spend several hours re-counting inventory because this app completely replaced our shopify inventory counts with our AMZ inventory (which was 0 because we were setting it up). Their customer service was very difficult and instructions were very unclear. You have to email them back and forth which is really inefficient and a waste of time. We asked for a video chat/screenshare several times and they just ignored the request. After realizing the app wouldn't do what it says, we asked for a refund (took several weeks to figure out it doesn't do what it says) and they said they have a 7-day trial and they wouldn't refund. They refused after saying if we send them the invoices for the app, they would refund it. This just shows they have terrible customer service. So because their app was misleading and because their customer service was awful, they get a 1-star review. We ended up using Amazon by CedCommerce and it works great. It does exactly what we need it to and syncs FBM changes back and forth from AMZ and Shopify. It's very affordable and they will video chat and screen share with you on-demand. They have a great chat feature that they respond to immediately and have helped us onboard the app. We highly recommend checking out Cedcommerce over Connectr. Just to be clear, we don't get anything for recommending them, we just had such an awful experience with Connectr that they deserve a public bad review and a recommendation of another product over them. To Connectr: You should have just refunded the money like you said you would, it was less than $25. You'll lose more than that in customers who won't use your app now."
"I used this app for all of my Shopify/Amazon FBA needs! it's a great little app with a nice and simple interface!
It does an amazing job of importing all of your listings from Amazon with the literal ""Click of a button"" and has loads of extras that can help you set up your listings in your Shopify store once the listings are imported! 
i.e. Importing Reviews and Shipping with FBA! :-)
It's also super easy to manage if you make updates to your Listing on Amazon, you just click a button and it re-imports and updates as little or as much as you want! 
Finally, I did have a few issues along the way getting everything set up but the support guys were amazing giving advice, and helping me along the way! 
If you're looking for a super cost effective way (you only pay for what you want!) to import your listings from amazon and then automatically (or manually) ship using FBA, then your search is over! :-) 
Highly recommended! 
James."
"Love this app, a pleasure to use. Clean user friendly interface, 2 weeks in and so far works very nicely. Flexible options, with a lot of freedom to make edits on our own w/o having to seek assistance. Way smoother then a previous app we were using. Quick customer support. Very positive experience!"
"Highly recommended! This is a very powerful app with everything you need if you're shipping from Japan. You can integrate multiple carriers and the interface is clean and intuitive. Support docs are thorough and the onboarding support I received from Thomas was spectacular. Always prompt, polite and professional. Couldn't ask for more. I'll give 5 stars when they release v2 of the app with a couple new Shopify features and especially when they add the option to schedule carrier pickup directly from the app. This is a much needed feature that will save a lot of time and I know Ship&Co will make it happen. I'm a happy customer!"
"I am so happy that this app exists. Before I found it I was so frustrated spending a lot of time with Japan Post's ""My-Page"" terrible interface. Now I can create e-Packet shipping labels in seconds. It saves me so much time! 
Thank you, Ship&co."
"Not very intuitive, says it's free but only to contact influencers with less than 10k followers. But most important, there's no other projects on there, only ""active"" project is the same one they show on the screenshots, if they are gonna fake it at least do different screenshots haha...  There's not a way to browse through influencers, you basically post your project and hope some influencers using this app bid on it... The interface is also a bit broken."
"Great insights, user experience and interface friendlyness. Customer support is also top of the line."
"I've been using this app for almost a year. It's operated flawlessly and their customer service is the BEST. The interface for editing descriptions, prices and stuff is a godsend! I'm setting up another Shopify store now and will absolutely be using IS for that one as well. I highly recommend them!!!"
"Good source of products, but I lacking in the user interface. You can't sort or filter through the feed easily.  Also, it would be nice if there were more customization options such as tags, product type, etc. from the customization screen. The suggested MSRP for the majority of the products I've imported are WAY off. With that said, I've been able to import 200 products to my site and the sync has been reliable."
"Simple interface, good customization options and the customer service is top notch. Exactly the app I needed for my store. Would recommend!"
"Not enough options, and the user experience is very bad. There is also not enough page templates. We are limited."
"This is by far the most intuitive Page Builder I have used for Shopify.  It has a very clean interface, and I was able to get up and running in less than 5 minutes.  I struggled with other Page Builders, and found them a bit too cumbersome.  This one is very clean, and the pages have turned out beautifully."
"We're huge fans of Enquire and the stellar team behind it! The user experience is seamless and the insights are incredibly meaningful. If you're looking to take your post purchase survey seriously, definitely check them out!"
"I JUST installed this app, and it was VERY easy to use. I checked my website and the email subscribe pop up that I wanted was there-so far so good!
Giving it 4 stars because I haven't really had time to work with it or get user experience. We'll see how it goes, but so far it's working great!"
"I was looking for an app to help me communicate my organisations sustainability goals and offset carbon from orders. The app has a great interface, the install was well guided and incredibly slick - I loved the extras like the brand kit and social media posts. The dashboard is informative and allows me real time data to communicate with my customers on the progress we are making."
"This app is fantastic - its very much in line with our business as we are an organic clothing label and our customers value our environmental ethos.  The customer service has been fantastic, and the developers have put in a lot of work to customise the user experience for us.  Excellent!"
"I have been using this app for nearly three years. There has recently, not sure how recent, been an update to the Google Shopping app that has changed to bulk editor. This change has not only increased the time to make bulk changes with an infinite scroll, but also while loosing some flexibility in the interface. Additionally, I noticed that a lot of my product attributes have been automatically changed without my consent. All of my apparel now says ""infant"" and all the genders on my clothing were switched to ""Male"". What a terrible experience. I will now spend hours correcting all this data. In addition to hours more spending on adding new items. Stop the infinite scrolling, bring back the page numbers for starters. It is too much data to compute with larger catalogs. Update on 6/1: This has been awful. The Shopify team reached out to me after my review, and after I spent over 24 hours of continuous work on my Google Merchant Center fields, to state they ""fixed"" the problems with the attributes shifting from Adult to Infant, and the Genders switching to Male. Their ""fix"" reverted all of my hard work back to its broken state of Male and Infant. I spent HOURS of my life changing them back to the right age group and genders. This has been terrible. Since I have highlighted this issue, their support staff has not responded to any of my follow-up. It's like they made my life more difficult and just forget about my business. Which has had an impact on sales due to this problem."
Really helped us clean up the out-of stock products in our collection pages so it made for a better user experience for our shoppers.
I used this app to help us during a promotion offering a free item and to allow prospects to reach the threshold to enjoy free shipping. The app has helped us simplify and customize the user experience. The customer service is fantastic and it is easy to set up.
"We have looked at a lot of inventory management systems and migrated from Tradegecko to DEAR. Extremely impressed with the product and system. It has a lot of manufacturing features that we do not use however for tracking purchase orders, bundles, composite products it is excellent. It is easy to duplicate products to quickly add or CSV can be imported. There is never going to be the perfect IMS for everyones business processes but this covers most of ours. We have suggested some improvments regarding batch actions via the web interface. Overall can recommend, no problems syncing with Shopify."
"DEAR connects seamlessly with Shopify, very easy to manage transactions, inventory movements and fulfillment processes. The interface is really user friendly and the learning curve isn't steep at all. Really simple to get things going. I have two feedbacks though:
1 - Email support answer times: given we're in Toronto, it's a bit of a problem when support is mainly active outside of working hours. I'm not saying that they only respond then, it's just that I usually loose a day with the majority of my issues - send an email during the day, get an answer by 8pm, start fixing it next morning. It's not bad, but it could improve. I understand there are other ways of connecting with their support, but email is still the go-to communication method for us.
2 - reporting capabilities and more specifically related to inventory transactions, There isn't a built in report that shows me which FG transaction was used to fulfill which SO, for example, which is crazy, considering I have auto-assembly enabled and there are notes on each FG showing which SO that FG was created for (when the FG was not actually used for that SO). Auditing can be a real pain."
"What a great little app, allows for such a good user experience to save customers time having to scroll to the top."
"We spent about a week trying to launch DEAR on our store and the experience was terrible.  Slow support that takes 24 hours to respond, and when they do respond they don't always answer our questions.  The guy who is supposed to help us with our integration hasn't responded to an email in 2 days.  Top it off with a buggy Web 0.5 interface.  You would think they would put their best foot forward when a new customer signs on, but fortunately they showed their true colors upfront.  Stay away from DEAR Inventory unless you like self-inflicted pain."
"DOES NOT sync inventory between Ebay, Amazon and Shopify.   Or it doesn't seamlessly.  I wanted to see my inventory on one page, but Marketplace Listings were in the Integration Channels --> Listings page, but Shopify was in the Inventory --> Product page. Exchanged emails with Support before getting a workaround solution, which wouldn't have streamlined anything. The interface was pretty and semi-intuitive , which is a shame."
After trying countless Inventory Management applications DEAR has proved to be superior by far. Super easy interface and their support service has been extremely helpful any time we've ran into any issues!
"Just started testing DEAR Inventory after long playing around with Stitch, Tradegecko and Orderhive. 
I can see now, it is love at first sight! Intuitive interface, great potential and flexibility above all. These guys did an unbelievable job. Worth trying! I like their fair and simple pricing structure as well. I will get back with my detailed overview still in January. Actually it's a pity they have so few reviews here in Shopify store, that was the reason why I first cut it off."
"DEAR is a top-notch system. For inventory geeks out there, this is the only system that - for the money - has multi-level BOM capability with auto-kit/assembly functionality. (TradeGecko, Stitch, Unleashed - none of those other systems offer that). That's huge if your store's products go through any sort of production, assembly or manufacture. 
For those who have used the system for a long time, it didn't used to have the prettiest interface, but DEAR just went through a complete overhaul and it's now more powerful and much more pleasant to use on a daily basis. 
If you're considering a serious system, this is the one for you."
"This app is great, it allows you to set rules specific to the variant or the entire product, collection or store and the interface is pretty user friendly. Customer service is wonderful, checking to see if I needed help and responded swiftly to the questions and provided me with suggestions. That being said, the app isn't perfect, I needed to do trial and error and make some compromised solutions to have the discounts work the way I want. Definitely looking forward to further improvements in the app! ps. would like to suggest an ""on"" and ""off"" button to the rules so we do not have to delete it and do it back again. Thank you, Omega team :)"
"We are a company that specializes in laser cutting services and material sales. The application is versatile, easy to use and clean looking for our clients. We had a small problem with the interface and their team fixed it remotely in less than two days. I would highly recommend this app & company to anyone."
"Great first experience building my app for my online business. Simple and easy-to-use interface and everything works the way it is supposed to. What’s more, is that they make you feel like you’re an enterprise client even if you subscribe to their basic plan. Try it out for yourself, would recommend it."
I tried almost all of the other app builders on the market and Mowico was definitely among the very best. It has an easy interface and their wizard was so practical. Everything is pretty straightforward and customizable as well. They are also open to new integration requests and they work with you giving you a clear timeline about when to expect everything to be finalized. I would recommend it to anyone looking to get a native mobile app for their online store
"Your app is pretty cool, No product quantity limit, even on the free plan！！！ A concise and clear operating interface, I was able to implement the app very quickly and generate a feed for the Facebook catalogue.Very good experience so far!"
Mowico helped me with its simple interface and customization options. It delivered as promised; a flawless mobile app.

Easy to install and very thorough.  Interface is easy to use as well. Very important for us at www.beneathyourmask.com
"Interface is extremely user-friendly, and the team makes it even better! We liked the app builder a lot. My team comes up with new ideas every day."

"Lots of great data points for making a decision whether to accept or deny, and if you aren't sure submit it for insurance for a reasonable percentage of the order.  I have used Cybersource's Decision Manager and Kount in the past before our site was on Shopify.  Both were a pain to integrate and had user interface's that look straight out of the early 2000s when they were created.  
Signifyd has a nice user interface and integration with shopify is as simple as pushing a button."
"This a great service/app. The writers are very talented both at their language skills and at their marketing angles. The interface is simple and efficient. If you are like me and get blocked when writing descriptions/social posts/etc, this app will make your life easier/happier :) Kudos to the team and the writters!"
Signifyd has been extremely helpful in avoiding chargebacks and the user interface is very simple and easy to navigate.
"We've been using this app for several months now without a hitch. Setup was easy, and the admin interface is very clean. When I emailed support for a change to text output that I couldn't access, Antonio made the change right away. Highly recommended."
"Very easy to install, good looking interface and simple to use.
Flags minor as well as major concerns - does make you investigate further. It also pulls in Shopify customer info to help you evaluate.
Would recommend."
This app has a great interface and is fairly simple.It is easy to use and you can generate organic traffic easily to your store from search engines
Great app.  It really adds to the user experience.  I will definitely recommend this app to family and friends
"I've used this app for years, mostly without trouble, but since I'm on the lowest plan they refuse to provide support even when it's about a bug in their app. No support for bugs means you're dead in the water, and who has time for that. OneBalance Fix for other users: If you need to use funds already in your OneBalance account, you can print your labels directly from Stamps.com. Their interface is clunky but it'll do in an emergency. Your Stamps.com login info is under ""One Balance and Carriers"", then ""Manage Passwords""."
"We highly recommend this app. The team support is exceptional. We're using a custom theme with complicated coding :) but was fixed as we intended to be. We like the look and interface of the app. Overall, highly satisfied customer here. thank you so much."
Shipping easy is fantastic. Easy shopify integration + easy to use interface. Support is there for us when needed. Price point is more than fair.
"WARNING: Out of date - DOES NOT SUPPORT CURRENT FULFILLMENT API'S!
Pro:
Great support. They know enough on the basic end to be helpful, and escalate when appropriate.
Relatively easy interface. 
Con. 
MAJOR: Hasn't been updated to support Shopify's new Edit Order function, (and the new fufilllment API's) 
https://shopify.dev/changelog/edit-orders-with-our-new-order-editing-apis
https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/shopify-order-editing
This needs to be fixed - it's been 9 months since these tools for Fulfillment apps were released by Shopify, and ShippingEasy isn't supporting them yet.
Overall the app is good. But this emerging issue is kind of a deal breaker.
We have a major issue where we cannot use the Shopify standard Edit Order feature because Shipping Easy doesn't pick up up on the changes that it makes the to order. Our shippers and pickers get confused and the order processors instructions aren't passed along."
"We use this app for our customers to quickly add products to their ""multi buy"" pack from a collection. This saves the customer having to click through to each individual product and selecting their option then returning to the collection and then having to repeat the process again and again. Overall this app improves the user experience tenfold. The help desk are responsive with a reply being sent through within 24 hours normally - max 48hrs. Highly recommend this app, it is simple and does the job."
Integration into Shopify has been great - Interface allows data to flow in the directions specified and have complete inventory and re-order tools through TradeGecko. Shopify allows us to reach multiple channels and TradGecko manages my business - It's a great winning combo!
"Efficient product adjustments make the site look neat. Super good user experience, this must be highly recommended. 1 minute to adjust a website, perfect."
"I have used TradeGecko on 2 stores and am very happy. 
All applications have their pros and cons, but I have found the TradeGecko team to be very open to suggestions for improvement, and willing to put the programming time in to execute them as quickly as possible.
The interface is straightforward and clean, easy to understand and intuitive. I am looking forward to more support for complex variants - especially in the fashion area where you have many style/colour/size combinations - this area could do with a more suitable ordering/invoice environment for these types of products."
"We here at Omni love TradeGecko.
The interface is clean , the system rarely crashes, and TradeGecko has worked wonders for our inventory management system .
Pairs well with both Shopify and Shipstation , and allows our small business to ship janitorial and paper supplies all over the Unites States with ease."
"Do not let the nice looking interface fool you. There are several issues with the TradeGecko platform and do not seem like they are gonna fix this any time soon. Have talked with support countless times. biggest issue in REPORTING.
used TradeGecko for 6 months now and are too invested in custom API'es to drop the platform unfortunately.
issues:
- shopify discount's is placed as a ""custom line item"" in tradegecko, and your reporting+dashboard do not read custom line items. So lets say you always give 20% discount through vouchers, your shopify sales in TradeGecko will be 20% off all the time. 
- if you create other custom sales items e.g. special one time produts/agreement etc. it will not show up in your TradeGecko sales/reporting
- many orders will not be ""fulfilled"" correctly because they do not support shopify value discounts, so POS orders often show a difference of 0.02 USD, so you need to write support to manually remove this incorrect difference through the back end.
- filtering menu's/overviews have no consistency and make no sense, some you can sort after, some you cannot etc.
- reporting/dashboard builder/filter is a joke and so badly executed. No logical sense and so many limitations. You have to export to excel and do everything manually to get any form for useful data
- many windows/tabs need to be refreshed manually to show incorrect data/changes
- picture sync from TG to Shopify products, works very bad an inconsistent. 
- all apps/features is US focused, almost none are really useable in Europe."
All well organized. Great job. Love the diverse functionality and well-thought interface.
"Awesome app... with the power of Trade Gecko and Shopify combined, your inventory, wholesale, Website and POS is covered. Easy to setup, great support and easy to use interface. Love it!"
"We recently expanded our shop and ran into a ton of problems trying to effectively integrate shipping and inventory across multiple sales platforms - ShippingEasy has saved us! Getting started was easy, the interface is intuitive for high volume shops and the customer service is stellar! We have had several phone sessions with their support staff in a short time and now our ShippingEasy presets are perfectly customized to our needs. Very happy and relieved to have them on our team."
"lots of functionality, with a clean interface. i haven't even begun to scratch the surface of everything that tradegecko can do, and everything is laid out in a very clean and easy to read manner. greatly enhances the capabilities of shopify."
"Tradegecko is an amazing inventory tracking app. Seamless connection with Shopify and other sales channels. Great customer support making tradegecko even easier to learn how to use. The interface of Tradegecko looks very similar to Shopify making it a comfortable addition to the suite of bookkeeping apps any company uses. Overall, very impressed with its functionality and efficiency."
User-friendly interface with a range of powerful tools.
"The app is perfect but it's even better the support team. Very easy to use, interface is clear and options self explanatory"
"The interface is just like Elementor, which is so convenient for people familiar with the WP Elementor plugin! :)"
"I moved from PageFly to this app because of the features it enables you to have otherwise ""premium"" to PageFly; However this app does have its flaws. 
1. The interface is very laggy and can sometimes need multiple refreshes to get it to load before you can start to edit. 
2. Whilst there is an option for adding collections, there is not any functions to manipulate the styling (remove descriptions, style layout for mobile)
Whilst this app offers many more features for a slightly more premium price, the app is good, the interface is nice and simple to navigate - could do with some tweaks here and there. I have found the support to be very friendly and helpful when you can actually get to talk to someone, I refrain from using the email support as these usually take quite some time (past experiences, have not tried with Buildify)"
"The app completely erased my original website after deleting it!! :(   All that's left is the main and footer menu!   So if you want to try it: make sure you make a copy of your theme before adding this app. 
I didn't like the app, it works inside your shopify interface, so everything is really small and you can't see what the desktop version will look like in real-life, because it's sqeezed in.  Also way more complicated to use compared to other page building apps I've tried.    Price is awesome tho."
"Nice interface, was able to create a professionally-looking comparison table within minutes. Haven't installed it yet, been prompted to leave this review in order to continue."
"This app has a ton of features. Its amazing in that department. Everything you could ever want.
Where it falls short is that the app consistently times out, crashes, wont let you save your work and the interface sometimes doesnt load at all. I think this company has major server issues."
"I have tried and tested every page building app on the Shopify App store, and I am in love with this one! Some of them can be buggy, but this one is very well build and I have yet to run into any hiccups! The interface is easy and simple to use, but there are plenty of rich features.
Installation was ridiculously simple; just one or two clicks from inside the app! No coding needed at all! I haven't needed to contact their customer service, so I can't speak on that, but if they're as good as the app they build then they're awesome!"
Excellent customer service....and very easy-to-use interface.
"This app is everything you will need for building amazing pages.  We couldn't be happier with the easy to use interface, the big variety of widgets and the layout options of the pages.  A must have for any shopify store.  Would highly recommend it!  It works great and the support is amazing!  5 starts, we LOVE IT!"
"Very edgy to work with, the video preview is much smoother than the actual interface once utilizing the app, therefore we are cancelling. Sorry."
"Great, fast customer service. We had a little issue that I wasn't able to fix but after a quick email right from the app interface they fixed it backstage."
"The developer, Peter, is wonderfully helpful, and his app rocks! I love the fact that there are video tutorials embedded in the app's interface; it makes getting set up SO much easier! HIGHLY recommend you install this app!!!"
"I was extremely skeptical about this app and just added it to try out. But it has improved PageSpeed results but also in about 2 weeks, my page passed core web vitals assessment according to field data, I was not expecting this since most big websites even cannot pass this and encourage people to use mobile apps. I think our SEO will improve accordingly since Google weighs too much importance on user experience."
"My Update the apps been installed over a month ago initially google did show my metrics and a pass however for last approx 2 weeks its showing not enough real user experience. The metrics did show previously in my google analytics account as well as speed test but now all that the real time data seems to have been erased by google and the only thing changed is adding the app ? Did send customer service no real explanation. I had already very good top 5 ranks in about 20 search and a ton more rank top 10 etc., and wondering if this app is hindering the search position or rank as search traffic has been less since app installed and if real world passed core metrics has dissipated whats the benefit ?
........................................... I have tried to find an app that will add speed for googles new indexing benefits as well as user experience and most actually gave a lower page speed. I found this app did the trick customer service was fast efficient and although only day 2 of using the app i give it the thumbs up and highly recommend."
Love this app. Especially love it for the FBA integration across all sales channels. It works seamlessly after a basic set up and it's the only software that I've found that pushes the tracking numbers from FBA to customers as well.  Super clean interface and is very user friendly. Highly recommend for anyone looking to automate this process.
"We've been using the original Sellbrite platform for several years and it has really streamlined our listings and helped us keep our sanity. The migration from the original platform to the Sellbrite for Shopify platform was much easier than we expected. Support was great! Prompt, friendly, and knowledgeable. We are able to see all of our orders from the Shopify interface which really helps our customer service/support team. If you are supporting several marketplaces this is a real productivity (and sanity) boost - definitely worth it!"
"ORIGINAL REVIEW 12/08/2018: Overall, I love Sellbrite and it has allowed me to easily consolidate inventory across channels. My only grudge is against their annual-billing process. I paid for a year up front ... and during the one month that I barely exceeded the order limit (BFCM, obv), my subscription was automatically upgraded and i was unexpectedly charged close to $1K for the pro-rated balance of the year. But the one month I exceeded the limit was a fluke (although I would LOVE for it to be the new norm) ... all in all, if your order volume has the potential to spike out of the limitations for one out of 12 months, I highly recommend going with monthly billing to save yourself from any potential shocks to your cashflow. But other than that, everything has been aces. They are usually super quick to respond to issues/chats and using Sellbrite has really helped expedite/streamline our in-house order fulfilling. 
UPDATE 07/06/2020: well, I have now been using Sellbrite for over 2 years. I am using their 2K Pro Sellbrite plan (not the Sellbrite for Shopify) ... I cannot say anything for ""Sellbrite for Shopify"" because that integration did not exist when I first signed up ... but their standard ""Sellbrite"" option, where all inventory is housed on Sellbrite instead of Shopify is amazing. ($179/mo instead of $99/mo)  I absolutely love being able to see ""available inventory"" vs ""reserved inventory"" and ""total inventory"" ... when you are adjusting the QTY for a 100 SKUs at a time, their bulk editor is the BEST. I did not want to lose that capability, so I stuck with the original Sellbrite instead of switching to Sellbrite for Shopify. 
I also never had any more hiccups with billing since I left my initial review. Back then, I went back to monthly billing and the *surprise* $1K charge was rolled into my postage wallet. Easy breezy. Now their plan allows for 2K orders instead of 1K; so I was able to go back to annual billing without having to worry about any unexpected pro-rated charges anytime soon. YAY! 
Overall, I *highly* recommend Sellbrite. The interface is so clean and contemporary vs other inventory consolidating software (I am a designer, so aesthetics are important to me) and I never had any big issues with Shopify/Amazon and Etsy all pulling from the same inventory. I was a bit worried when I heard that GoDaddy acquired Sellbrite (cause that usually causes everything to go downhill) but it has not negatively affected my experience at all. Thanks, Sellbrite!"
"One of my favorite Shopify apps. Integrates seamlessly with Shopify and Klaviyo. The user interface is incredibly simple to use, but the result is spectacular. My ROI is fantastic, even after only my first campaign. I am utilizing both automated and one-off campaigns, and so far, I'm extremely happy with the results! Customer service is also superb."
Very fast and responsive support team and an easy to use interface that allows quick communication with customers.
"Message Mate is a great app with an easy interface for customers to ask quick questions or engage in longer conversations - usually about product advice or recommendations. A very high percentage of our inquiries result in an immediate online sale or direct order through the Shopify draft order system. Selling specialized products to a wide variety of ages, we find our customers enjoy the informal, personal, timely and non-threatening nature of dialog via text."
Working with this app was really smooth and I love the interface. Its fairly easy to pickup and when I needed some assistance Sherwin was extremely helpful and patient with me. I highly recommend.
This app is easy to use with multiple option products. The interface is user friendly. The customer service is superb.
Super effective post card app! High ROI and I would definitely recommend. The interface is easy to use and the postcards were easy to set up.
"I will update this review once I have my results from the first campaign, but so far I am VERY impressed. The interface is intuitive, fast, and the deep shopify integration is brilliant. I just sent 60 50% off coupon cards to my VIP purchasers of $600 or more in 2020 for $53.40. If only (1) of those post cards converts, it'll cover my entire investment 2x over. Thanks so much PostPilot, I think we will be using you a LOT in the future. - Lambertones Pickups UPDATE: 10/15/20 So far our first campaign has a 749.06% ROI. Don't waste any more time dear reader, its time to send a postcard."
"Really really good app! Exactly that, for what I am looking for. Good support, good interface and easy concept. Nice!"
Top notch support team and user friendly interface. Have some issues with integration but they were fixed quickly by Robert.
"I've tried a few other FAQ/Help Center apps, and I just wasn't satisfied. HelpHQ is a fantastic app! The user interface is so easy to use and set up. The FAQ page on my store looks professional and easy for customers to find information. Robert was extremely helpful and patient. He was also receptive to feedback. The only thing I don't like is I have to contact them to uninstall or install the app instead of a one-click uninstall option. Overall, great app and fantastic customer service."
"This app has gotten a number of negative reviews due to its poorly-done integration of a subscription option through Shopify. Here is a review of the actual product: I've been using OptinMonster since 2015 for various sites I have. They pioneered a lot of the techniques you see everywhere now, like ""exit intent"". OptinMonster is expensive(but they have good Black Friday deals), and I've tried many times to switch to a more affordable provider. But the other providers all force me to make compromises on the feature set, ease of integration, and user experience. The types to behavioral targeting you can do in OptinMonster is unmatched by any other tool. There is a big difference in product quality when you have an entire team dedicated to making the best opt-in forms, versus those forms just being one feature of many in an app like Klaviyo or Mailchimp. I can't speak on this $50/month subscription they offer through Shopify. That seems stupid. I bought a subscription from then in 2015 through their website. My recommendation is to buy from them during Black Friday when they are usually 30% off."
"Airfields makes it childishly easy to create custom sections for our different product pages and landers. Simple interface, never any problems suiting our needs. Highly recommended for those that love to build."
"Great app! Dramatically improved the functionality, design and overall user experience on our site. Allowed us to enable a custom look and feel to our store. Look forward to continuing use and development. Great work, easy to use and I couldn't recommend this app enough!"
"This app has been incredibly helpful for organizing all of our custom theme's various metafield sections - at the product level, and at the collection level. It's also allowed us to work with our developer team to build out dynamic experiences like product bundles and cart upsells. The interface is simple to use and understand, and it has allowed us to quickly and easily make changes to our website!"
Great and fast help from the team. Many thanks for that. A Slide Cart in general is highly recommended for a better user experience and conversion. I like the Slide Cart app for its clean design and features.
Amazing app and support team. Clean and straight- forward app interface Highly responsive and helpful when we needed assistance.
"Its amazing simply interface and dashboard. Was very easy guided process of setting up my app. Support team works over the clock to make it even easier. Just waiting to be launched and can't wait!! over excited, our dreams come through much faster with Vajro! Great job guys! Thanks a lot. Sasha Riess"
I really like the user interface for the app and the design feature is really easy to use. The support team are also really helpful and great to work with.
Easy to setup. Nice interface. Worked with alot of other Shopify plugins. Helpful customer service. I would recommend them anytime.
"This is one of the best apps that we are using in our Shopify store. Especially Robert is super helpful and solved all the problems we had. Even created a custom app feature for our current shopify theme. The app is amazing. If you want to reduce checkout abandonment, then you need to use the app. It is better for user experience."
Works perfectly. The interface is easy and it offers several customization options. It is what I was looking for.
User friendly interface development. There are a variety of widgets to create your own personalised layout to the store. The support is prompt and understanding.
"We are Mischief Munchkins®, an online clothing store for kids based out of Bangalore, India. When we first started exploring our options to get an App (iOS and Android), the first option for us was to get it built from scratch since budget was not a constraint. Soon we learnt that there are other equally interesting options (like mobile app builders) which are quicker, easier and also cost effective. This realisation brought us to the Shopify App store in search of companies that can build native apps for us on iOS and Android platforms. As a part of our research, we went through all the alternatives, read all the reviews (good and bad), spoke to a few companies and then finally freezed on Vajro! Vajro, just like other mobile app builders, work on a set templates/theme to achieve goals of their clients. All mobile app builders, unlike custom built apps, have limited functionalities and as a client or a user of such services, its our responsibility to either know it before hand or to ask them in advance about the limitations and work-arounds! My first interaction was with Aswin (from sales team). I contacted him well before (months before) we were even ready with our website! He made sure that he was in touch with us till we were ready with our website and helped us to get started with Vajro with a marathon 2.5+ call! Thank you Aswin for that! We opted for power premium, their top of the line plan. It's recommended for businesses who are serious about their goals and clear with their plans. The next step was with the onboarding team. This step again began with a marathon call with Pranav who was very patient to hear all our queries and address them. This call was then followed up by a second onboarding call with Ranjan. Again, he was very clear in what could and couldn't be done with Vajro. This gave us much better clarity and helped us to set our expectations accordingly. Post this, we were then assisted by Elakkiya who helped us to put everything in place and ensured that our app goes live as early as possible. With her as well, we had a couple of detailed calls regarding our expectations and requirements. She appeared to be proactive and very well organised and helped us with most of our requirements. A special note of thanks to Marshall, their graphic designer who impressed us with his proactiveness in assessing a tricky situation and offering us a solution. This was not expected and it came as a pleasant surprise! Pros of using Vajro 1. Easy to set-up 2. Well informed, well coordinated and friendly support staff who are always available 24/7 via scheduled zoom calls and chat. But please ensure to stick to one person aligned to your region to ensure that communication is smooth, consistent and clear. Initially, unknowingly we approached mutliple people working across different regions with our requirements which kind of caused delays and frustations but was later on sorted out. 3. Appears to have a good pool of plugins/app integrations compared to their competitors 4. Nicely structured process flow. From Sales to Onboarding to Customer Success (guess only on their top tier plans) to Tech support 5. 60 days of free trial Cons 1. Because it's a theme/template based system/interface, one cannot expect everything as per your requirements. Any custom coding done on your website will not be supported by their softwares. All the active features on your website (achieved either by custom coding or via app/plugin) will not be translated to your app if that particular plugin is not supported by Vajro! So, please check before getting started and set your expectations accordingly to avoid any unnecessary frustrations and delays. For example, their software were not able to pull in our size charts, pin-code and cod checker, shipping and returns tab. If you are lucky, you do come across certain supported integrations/apps to solve some of these issues if not all. Hence, you may sometimes feel handicapped when you run out of options to achieve your goals. But please note that this is not just unique to Vajro but infact, common to all such website app builders! 2. Room for improvement in terms of adding additional features and plugins 3. Once you select a theme/template, apart from the con discussed in point 1, you also cannot 100% customise the theme/template according to your requirements. Again, not unique to Vajro! Pro Tips 1. Do your research. Know what you are getting into. With any such website app builders, you get some, you lose some! 2. Don't assume that everything will work in your favour. Discuss with the team in detail. 3. Be patient when a certain feature you desperately want is not available. Try figuring out a work around, if possible. It may not be the ideal way of doing things but its better than not having it at all! We are happy to rate them 5 star based on our interactions, goals achieved, and finally, the alternatives available. We are excited to see our app go live soon and are looking forward to interacting with the customer success and tech team (as and when needed)"
"I have Shopify for my online business for several years. I decided togo to Omni Channel and migrate our pos to Shopify POs. It has been an awful experience.The onboarding team just email you some links with no follow through. We have spend many hours on support call. The support team are very knowledgeable and helpful. All our bluetooth devices stay connected but the barcode scanner gets disconnected. We have turned off the energy setting to ""leave on all the time"" to no avail.Shopify support told us to leave the system on 24 hrs a day. This did not solve the problem. every morning you have to connect the scanner from scratch. we even send the brand new scanner for repair and used another new scanner with the same issue.This problem has nothing to do with my bluetooth since the other devices such ac tap/Chip and receipt printer stays connected. The interface between pos and barcode scanner is not stable. I have paid for several months but not able to go live. If I could have returned my hardware I would have not continued. Shopify should do way better with their pos considering the runup on theri stock price."
Easy to use interface with minimal clicks to a printed label. Automatically Syncs with your shopify store when starting up the App. Their shipping prices are quite competitive and support is excellent. Highly recommend this time and money saving app.
"WARNING FOR THOSE WHO ACCEPT INTERAC DEBIT! Shopify has now disabled support for the Moneris External PIN PAD, meaning those Canadian clients who accept INTERAC DEBIT can no longer provide PIN pad access (for entering PIN #s to their clients). PIN#s now have to be entered using the iPad or iPhone device, which in the time of COVID is a health risk, especially if the iPad is behind your counter (bye bye social distance). The only way an INTERAC user can complete their transaction is through the new CHIP and PIN reader, via TAP, but TAP transactions have $100 limits, meaning if you sell anything over $100 (like we do ALL the time), the client cannot pay for it with INTERAC. It is insane that a Canadian founded and Canadian based company, cannot integrate properly with a very popular Canadian payment method??? Added to this, Shopify has taken what used to be an included free feature (POS functionality), and made it an $80 USD paid feature per month, this is insane! And as you can see by all the 1 star reviews, that $80 USD per month is buying you a worse experience! Shopify has lost a lot of high executives over the past few weeks (they have all left), it seems they are losing their way with innovation and user experience as well, a shame to see what was a core strength with Shopify (Shopify POS), turn into what may lead to their downfall."
"The POS app is horrible...and it is extremely overpriced as well. It is obviously not anyone used to, or that have researched what it is like to be on the floor in a retail store. Very limited customization, too much noise in the interface, and lacking must-have functionalities. Not recommended at all."
"Great app, great support! Very intuitive interface for designing popups, and lots of features. Thanks so much guys!"
"***Helpful to a point. But will take YOUR tech-savviness to be successful***
The App is helpful as it means I only have 1 inventory between my online and in-store shoppers. I also like how mobile it is, and how quick it is to checkout. My 2-star deduction is because sometimes it takes a minute or two for things to sync between the Shopify admin and POS. Something might scan and be found through search in the admin interface but when attempting to scan or search through the POS, it won't find it. This has forced us to use the Custom Sale option but means we have to backtrack and fix quantities later-- so it's like i have two inventories again. The support is fine- they are always available but sometimes we get lost in translation and they often have scripted responses that are frustrating, as it feels they're not really hearing me and my needs, but trying to get 5 Star survey results. I was sifted through several ""launch specialists"" when I was converting systems and it was tough to feel helped as I had to reexplain and reintroduce my progress to several people. Eventually, I just stopped asking as they seemed too busy or uninvested. I would call instead of email as email tickets can take several days or they don't answer at all. Other updates I'd like to see: Making a specific collection ""non-discountable"" as we offer a ""member"" discount for people every day, but some items' profit margins are too narrow to apply an additional discount. So my staff needs to outsmart the system. Secondly, a connection to Blackbaud would be awesome as I could load or view my members through there. Finally, as a non-profit Museum, this has been an inexpensive way to stay in modern times but our store has a lot of products (5000+) available that it seems Shopify struggles to update or keep track of seamlessly."
"Nobody is 100% But 215 are not far off I have just spent 20 mins reading all of these reviews, and in my experience working with 215 some I agree with and some I don't. Firstly 215 are a great company to work with, I find their user interface easy to use and to create my products and their pricing is very fair for a UK based company. The products are printed well and vibrant which is why we are all here right. They however, they do say you can tell a company’s worth by how they act when something goes wrong. It Nobody can expect from the volumes that are ordered for everything to be 100% as things do go wrong - we are all human right. I had an issue only once where a print was not quite right, I emailed them and they resolved this within one hour, leaving a more satisfied customer at the end of the day. So to say their support is poor for me is untrue as I found it fantastic. (please note there was a genuine reason for the garment being sent in the first place) - so I am happy with everything being 98% but their support being of 100%. If you have read this far, well done, I will be finishing now with my final thoughts (very Jeremy Springer (I know). I would highly recommend 215, they have a fantastic package all in all and perfect to upscale your business when you needed."
"easy , fast, and good support team ! i like the app it help so much . i recommend it , you can filter your words too and super user friendly interface in setting or dashboard , thanks you so much"
"I am very pleased since using this software. I live in an area where there are 3 languages, and this app is user friendly and interface is easy to navigate. With my busy schedule it
did not take long to set up and the edits were 
very easy to make. I recommend using this 
app!"
"Dovetale has really clean UI and intuitive user experience. I'm using it to prospect, manage, and communicate w/ our influencers and we're saving so much time & pain with streamlined process and flow. Highly recommend!!"
"The application is so good , It has a nice interface. Thank you for your quickly response. I can't wait to see the effect."
"Beautiful interface that seems too seamless to be true (it isn't). No more jumping between spreadsheets, portals and our Shopify page to make sure each ambassador/affiliate has the right code - everything is done for you. My only regret is not using this years ago. Highly recommend to anyone managing ambassadors and/or affiliate in-house."
"After my previous gallery app got discontinued, I was frantically looking for replacement and came across Cozy Image Gallery app. Boy, I wish I found it earlier! Great interface, easy to use and I can finally bulk upload my images! My galleries are big and having an option to upload tens of images at the time is a true life / time saver.
Also, customer service is top notch - I had an issue with image sorting and they custom-fixed it for me in no time.
Overall, highly recommended!"
"Pretty good app. Allows you to redirect or block access for countries, regions (states - U.S.), or even cities! Working very effectively, with zero issues. Extremely simple interface as well. Overall 10/10"
"I strongly recommend this app. The app include many features, which not available in similar apps. Simple and friendly user interface. Support team is awesome...they are fast in resolving issues. Thank you Qikify team for job well done!"
Amazing customer service when I couldn't set it up and a beautiful interface - cant recommend enough!
"Fantastic app, we have been using this for over a year now with great effect. The interface is easy to navigate and pact full with actually useful feature sets. However, what keeps us from finding a better deal, is the fantastic backend team that continually provides support with requests for new features and updates to existing one."
"Loved the app! Very simple interface and user experience. The Support team was very helpful in tweaking the app to my websites needs and appearance and I can already see some growth in the average cart value. Would love to see Loyalty Points as a gift option, but as is I can really recommend this app!"
Works exceptionally well. Integrates data from a number of different sources into an easy to interpret interface. Especially helpful for knowing when to “scale up” a store. Was using rough approximations prior to getting this app. Highly recommend.
"Easy to install. Flexible to control the snow quality, size and color that won't affect the interface. Also, i do appreciate the responsive customer service! Highly recommend!"
"Great to find an app that's so capable for post-purchase upsells, but also free! Most are v expensive even to try. Setup was a breeze. You can set up fairly complex funnels without any difficulty. Interface is nice to use. I can see myself recommending Kaktus. Thanks."
"First of all, five stars because it's the ONLY APP that unbundles orders correctly. I installed like 20. Here's what could be improved: The interface is not... really... good. It's a little clunky and not obvious how to get around and what things mean even though there is an explanation. However it only took like 5-10 minutes to figure out what was going on, and I consider myself tech savvy. I will be using this app because literally it's the ONLY ONE that does what it needs to and that is worth so much right now. My accountant will thank me. There's a lag and you have to manually sync inventory to shopify and back. I don't think the ability to edit all of the product information within bundleup is necessary - just the bundle component. It wouldn't sync price from Bundleup --> Shopify right away for example. The unbundling order features and inventory adjustments would be much better if they ran on a tighter schedule than 10-15 minutes. Especially because we have a high volume of orders on certain days and that would be enough to throw it off - ESPECIALLY with large quantity wholesale orders. I really do wish this was a faster or immediate sync like I've seen with other apps' inventory features. At the end of the day, waiting an extra 20 minutes to fulfill a last minute order is kind of annoying, really. That being said though, you guys accomplished something literally EVERYONE ELSE COULD NOT and I applaud you for that. Custom bundles would be an amazing addition - but obviously not docking you for something you didn't even claim to have."
"It does not get better than this. Tapcart offers an easy-to-use interface, they build the app for you, meets all your needs and way more. There are some really valuable features (like app-exclusive discounts), a gorgeous UI for customers, and a world-class service from the Tapcart team that's unmatched. Alex, our representative, always offers everything he can to elevate our app to the next level. Tapcart really does stand out in service, experience, quality, and so much more. Push notifications being free, designers helping with the layout of the app, monthly calls to make sure the business is running smoothly - what more could we ask for?"
I used this app it helped to resolve the invoicing problem. It's great and easy to use and configure. The interface is quick and user-friendly.
"We were using this app to make better user experience on our site. I've used several such tools and always had the following problem (other apps are slow, and doesn't integrate well with custom page builder) The support of Sticky Cart- Slide Cart Drawer helped me to install the code on my page builder in few minutes only, and the result? The app is super fast (even faster than before) very functional and easy to use for our customers. You can't go wrong with this app"
The Switcher works well and the interface is simple and clean. The service team is kind and helpful that gives support immediately.
"Wow! The team at Tapcart has made our dream come true! They have allowed us to create an app, fully functional, beautiful, and without a flaw. The support staff is super responsive and they have made designing so easy with awesome drag and drop features. We are now on the APP Store for an affordable price and it was so easy to do. Not only is the user interface on our side and consumer side superb they have increased our conversion rates AND our average cart has increased by $100+!! That's amazing. We are looking forward to the future with Tapcart."
"This software is free to use, and the interface settings are very simple, I like this app very much,"
"Highly recommend Tap cart for mobile app solution, loved the design and interface. Easy to use and integrate. Support from Cole was commendable. Thank you so much Tap cart and Cole :)"
"I used Tapcart app, honestly i didn't imagine that i will get sales from it, but it pushed my store to the next level, i got many purchases through it, it's better for user experience than mobile website, i highly recommend to use it."
"It's a great application, the user experience is very good, the attitude of the customer service Sonali is very good, and the service speed is also very fast. is a degree I would recommend to others."
"30 days after launching I can finally provide a sound review of tapcart. having tried 3 platforms that provide a similar solution our team made the decision to go with tapcart. in comparison to the other 2 platforms, Tapcart offered the best user interface, fastest load time, ease of implementation and their team also answers our questions faster and with more adequately."
"Really easy to use, clean interface! Love how it looks on the site and at a good price! I recommend this app to anyone!"
I am using this app is very nice. The interface is well and I can now use in my own Shopify. Do not hesitate to download.
"Very useful application and easy setup - Customer Support is extremely good, thank you Srashta Team for quick response while doing setup. Will recommended to others who do not know anything about Real time currency switching. Geo Location functionality is very useful, People are from different country can feel Native user experience with help of ""Srashta Currency Switcher"". Thank you for your kind support."
"This app help our team a lot to to take our business next level. ZOKO's interface is very intuitive and easy to use. It is single platform, have multiple users to reply to messages and an intuitive application with excellent functionality. I really like this app.."
"I usually dont leave reviews, but I didn't want to pass up the opportunity to do so because ZOKO is the best technological application that we have used to maximize the Shopify ecosystem. ZOKO's interface is very intuitive and easy to use, and it also has many very interesting features if your online store is on Shopify (i.e. place orders, track shipments, cancel items, among many others). In addition, the ZOKO team is totally open to developing new features so that we all benefit from the new capabilities. If you want to use the app not just for customer support, but to truly increase conversion rate, ZOKO is the ideal tool for you!"
"This app fits our use-case perfectly! It's super easy to share information about items with customers, send them a link to the checkout, create automation flows, and so much more. The interface is easy to use and intuitive, having some smart user experience choices. The support team is hands-on and responds quickly. They really take the time to understand your problems and go out of their way to help you succeed. This a great attitude!
We didn't even know such a neat tool existed until we stumbled upon it, which brought our business operations to the next level. Thanks a lot, guys!!"
"Update on 21st October 2020: Pathetic, Pathetic and Pathetic..... I don't have any words to express my frustration...... The guy named jacibs, only calls when the review is updated. Gives False Promises and nothing moves on. I don't know what kind of Customer Responsiveness they are taught.... Simply Disgusting.. Order Placed on 8th October. Wrong Product Delivered. Spoken to jacobs Twice..... Mails shared with actual picture of the product and ordered product. Got a confirmation mail saying that product would be picked up but twice its rejected saying that you have not mentioned the reason for the Return. Pathetic..... Twice and now customer is pissed off.... doesnot want to do business with us.... what kind of Childish company you have....... Lastly, moving out of Glowroad app today and and will leave Shopify too after few days. Disgusting Experience. Update for my review : Dear Jacobs and Glowroad Team, I must say that you are unnecessarily harassing your Customers. Today, the Courier Guy (Mr. Vikas from Shadowfax, Cell No. 9873451628) has come to pick up the Return shipment from Ms. Vibha Upadhaya (GlowRoad Order # 660197405) and he rejected the pickup as he says that Reason for return is not mentioned in the system. Pls note that it was very well mentioned in the Return request that wrong piece has been delivered against the said purchase. He was so rude with the Lady customer as well as me. Its sheer harassment due to your Ridiculous software app and your pathetic Customer service. 1 Star is for the Beautiful Catalogue that is provided on the website but the story starts after that. 1. Pathetic Customer Responsiveness. I have been following up for a GST invoice for last 2 months but its not delivered yet. 2. The Support button does not take the company. keeps on giving error message. 3. Wrong Items are getting delivered. No control on following basic discipline in processing the Orders. 4. The quality of Products delivered is not good. It shows great quality in pictures but when delivered, its pathetic. 5. The interface is not User-friendly. The order requested for Return goies out of the system and you can't check, what is the status on the order. We are thinking of moving out of this engagement as Its a pain."
This app has helped us increase our business by 30% and the level of engagement it allows for with our customers is exceptional. We're very happy Zoko customers and would highly recommend them for your business. The interface is improving with every day so we're excited to be on this journey with them as they grow.
"The user interface can be more refined.. BUT it does what it says it does. Has all the options I need for my business. May not work for some themes and there could be some trial and error to get things to work but if you would just contact support, they would get someone to look into it to make it fit your site. 5 stars for amazing and responsive service which is really the most important part of any business in today's world, really. Thanks Tommy and team!"
"so simple and easy - the user experience looks great, and when it looked wonky on desktop, I reached out for help, and they were quick to help provide a fix (even on the weekend!)"
"Easy to setup. Will see how it helps me in ad campaign
Very user friendly interface and free plan is very cost effective"
"Simple interface, no complex rules, easy installation. App worked right out the box with no issues."
Great app for our website especially with over 1000+ different car models and makes that we offer; this app compliments the user experience and is easy to use.
I am super happy with the User Interface and mostly with Support (very important) actually is the support that made me to increase my admiration for the app and the reviews. very friendly customization options and make you site look professional.
"Amazing APP! Interface is simple, heaps of features and great straight forward flat monthly fee.
Highly Recommend - great job Segment.ly!"
"Great app, great support. Easy to install and use for multiple catalogs. Friendly interface.
Highly recommended"
"Great app, been looking to code this functionality for a long time, but the user-interface and ease of use Variant Description OMG has created with this app, is unbeatable. Also supprot is super fast and clear. Mircea, was of great help!"
"We absolutely love LiveChat. We've explored other support apps, and many add more bells and whistles, however, LiveChat focuses on Chat on does a tremendous job at it. Our agents love the ""sneak peak"" feature because they can start preparing their answers and reply faster. They also love the ""simplicity"" of the interface which is easy to learn. 
The ticketing feature, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp integration work nicely as well. Right now we have all our customer support channels centralized in LiveChat and that has made a big difference. We are also looking into some of their other products like Chatbot which seems to work well. 
Lastly, their service is great, their team is always online and willing to help! Highly recommend the App and the team behind it."
"The analytics were great. The alerts were terrible. Sometimes we didn't get a notification till after the 3rd message from a customer.  They got our billing wrong, and shut down our account...twice. Then when we attempted to chat with them they weren't there. 
So why 3 stars: If you are sitting at your computer with their website up, it's a nice interface, good data, and useful.  
But if anything goes different, it's a real pain."
"I used two of Qikify apps Mobile Menu & Smart Menu, I have not had an issue with either one. It's one-click installation, easily navigatable interface just a breeze to get started. Mobile Menu makes browsing on mobile more efficient for customers. Check both apps out on my site tie-fly.myshopify.com or tieflyclothing.com!!! Tie - Fly Clothing & Hair Co. appreciated & approved!!!"
App is really good! I like the interface - really clean and the modern design it creates. Good if you're building a minimalistic page. I highly recommend this app for stores that manage multiple locations/stores.
"Simple and perfect. Ran some tests and it's great, syncs the products easily and quickly. I was glad for the free option, as we needed something for proof of concept without being charged monthly. I just hope we get more products so that we can give you money! Wonderful support too. I can only hint towards developing better interface options for viewing plan pricing down the road. Other than that, flawless."
"I REALLY LIKE THE FEATURES AND APP INTERFACE, ESPECIALLY THE CUSTOMER SERVICE. 5 STAR FROM MY SIDE ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
"Not only is this App versatile and I can See MANY opportunities to use it in stores I set up.. I am also very impressed with the support speed and quality of the development team. Would give 10 stars if I could.
For sure this tool is a solution for many restrictions the admin interface puts on the customer."
"We are using Foodee since few days in our restaurant with delivery system.
The order interface is super clear and perfect for the crew in kitchen (it's better than the normal orders interface for them).
The support was SUPER fast : Question > Contact > Fix > Deploy in production in less than 1h... 
At this speed, this app will be the ""MUST-TO-HAVE"" for any Restaurant on Shopify.
I hope the best for the dev team."
Setup is easy and straightforward. I like the user interface. Looking forward to adding affiliates and promoting.
Best affiliate app on the market! its so simple and easy to use! Very user friendly and the interface is amazing
So far the setup has been easy and well guided. It's a well designed interface and integration with Shopify
Easy-to-use interface. Support team is responsive after I ran into a hick-up. I'm glad I found this app!
"EXCELLENT support, responded to everything quickly and they solved all of my initial quibbles. Very intuitive interface for creating bundles."
"I was looking for all-over print hoodies and joggers and have stumbled upon Subliminator and never looked anywhere else! The print quality is superb, the colors are vibrant, the textures are very well defined and sharp, no slacking whatsoever! The fabric is thick and the quality of the fashion hoodie and fashion joggers is beyond my expectations, I was blown away with the softness on the inside, just feels amazing to wear the jogger-hoodie combo. The stitching looks very professional and up to a standard. The user interface itself is very user-friendly and easy to use! For all-over print, don't even look anywhere else, you won't regret going with the Subliminator!"
"A really easy user interface, probably one of my favorite ones to design in. The mockups on everything I've designed so far are really great. The products look good and I love all the choices. I can't wait to see what they add to their catalog next!"
Juste parfait et incroyablement fluide. L'interface est intuitive et les fonctionnalités complètes.
"Amazon Integration Plus app creates a harmonious flow connection between our store and our Amazon seller account. It's very remarkable how easily our products are being listed just by following the integration process. The app interface is very straightforward and very flexible to our needs. And to add it up they have a very knowledgeable, kind and dependable, customer service assistant. Thank you so much for your guidance and help Keterson!"
"This app has a LOT of features, and you have a LOT of control over how your products and orders sync compared to other apps on the market. It gives you better visibility to what's going if you have sync issues so you can work on addressing them yourself. Which I like. However, I would highly recommend setting up a one-on-one call to get this configured properly. I am fairly tech savvy, the interface and configuration is not very intuitive. You can tell the developers put a lot of time and thought into logic of program, but the interface could use some love to make it a faster setup process. The support manuals are a good start but some need to be updated and are missing important details around creating your models for specific products. If you're use to creating listings manually in Amazon, this will make sense as you go through it. Like I said it's got a lot of features and configurations that you need to setup properly or you're going to have a ton off issue. I've tried 2 other apps that Shopify recommended, and I didn't care for them because of sync issues and their support was lacking. Once you figure out how to use it, it's a very powerful program. ---- Also, this app was not developed as a SALES CHANNEL, so it will not show up on our home page dashboard under sales channel like all the other amazon apps did. The recorded sales will still show up on the home screen, but it shows up under other. In my opinion, technically it's a sales channel and should show up as a sales channel on the dashboard. But it's not the end of the world and you can still run reports and identify the amazon sales. ---- It took me a day or two and some time with support staff to understand the ins and outs of it. I spent time myself going through the tutorials and trying to configure it myself before jumping on a onboarding call. There were some issues with orders being imported into the system that was removing inventory and showing up under inventory history but didn't tie the order number to the inventory from that location and was not assigning orders to the proper location. However, support implement that that feature quickly and fixed the location mapping issue. Then spent time going over the configuration and testing. Support is good ---- I have a few more things I need to work on with app but so far, the sync is working properly. I am day 10 into it, so far so good after a bumpy start. The app does work, you just need to spend some time understanding it and pay close attention to configuration. ----Also make sure you're SKUs are the same on Shopify and Amazon, if not they will not sync. I gave it a 4-star rating due to the comments noted above."
"Every store needs this! Especially in the Apparel space. Customers add wrong sizes/colors to their carts all the time. Sometimes they just have a last minute change of heart and want the green vs the blue t-shirt. In today's busy day and age, nobody wants to go through 5 minutes of removing the item from the cart, navigating back to the product page, re-selecting, going back to cart.... you're loosing conversions right there!
This app fixes that on the spot. 3 clicks, all in one interface and you've changed the size/color and ready to check out.
App is fast, I saw no delay in load speed at all. Looks great, fits right into my interface. I needed some custom modifications to get the right look and functionality working and everything was done by the developer to insure that the app is working properly and fits my store perfectly. It was all done very promptly and with the upmost professionalism. 
The one time fee is a bargain and the support you get is world-class. 
Highly recommended!"
100% better than what I was using! Also love how clean the interface is and how quick and easy it was to set up. Thankyou!!
I love the interface of the app and the owner is quick to respond on support! Also fast bulk shipping is perfect for my business.
"FlavorCloud has been working really great for us ever since we've transitioned our international shipping over to it. The rates for shipping, especially for express shipping like DHL are much cheaper (like 50% the cost) than the rates I've negotiated in the past. It's also great that customs duties can be collected up front, so my customers have a smoother process with receiving their shipments. The customer service team has been superb as well, and they've followed up with me relatively quickly whenever there's been an issue. The user interface for shipping is a bit clunky at the moment, but I'm looking forward to the future version of the interface when it comes out, as they've collected feedback on pain points and suggestions for improvement from me and others."
"CANADIANS BEWARE. AVOID THIS APP. This app is just not set up for success if you're a Canadian shop. I signed up with the promise of hassle free shipping and faster shipping times. When my international orders came in, the issues started. Not only did the app constantly miss uploading orders (causing me to contact flavorcloud for assistance) but I wasn't even able to ship them. I had orders sitting for over a week while they were ""working on it"" and the only time I was able to get information was if I was the one who reached out first (which was every time). The idea was that they would send me a consolidated label, so I would ship all of the international order together to Asendia in the US and from there they would go onto their destinations. All of this was to take a maximum of 10 business days. Well, it took a week for them to get me the label, almost 2 weeks for Asendia to receive, and another week for them to ship them out and not a single one (another week later) has made it to their destination countries. The app also has so many bugs and glitches, it's a horrible interface. Absolutely awful service, I DO NOT recommend unless you want empty promises and angry customers. I could honestly go on and on about all of the issues I had with this company."
"Best app so far, i love the user interface and how easy it is to use.  IF you are looking for best in class catalog building software at an affordable rate, i would definitely recommend catalog machine!"
"One of the best Shopify store integrations we have added to date and this is not an exaggeration. The support is top-notch and thorough with onboarding, upkeep, and operational support. They truly care about what they do, who they serve, how and why they are doing it. Very simple interface that seamlessly integrates with our store and provides our international customers an easy and transparent checkout experience. Shipping int'l e-comm was such a long and manual process before but Flavorcloud has changed the game. We cannot be any happier with their service and feedback we are getting from our beloved international customers."
"We had been struggling with the complexity of international orders for some time - it was a real problem given that @50% of the business was from outside the US.  FlavorCloud was a great solution for us - we were live in 24 hrs and were able to ship orders straight away.  
The customer experience is very good and creates consumer confidence in the checkout and reduces post shipment Customer Service. The operator interface is intuitive allowing for ease of shipping and the creation of tailored programs & promotions.  The economics look good and we are more profitable given the increased conversion, lack of CS and reduced shipping rates (all of which more than offsets the fees, which are on an order basis so no fixed costs). Great app and great team who support us - highly recommended."
So far so good! I've been working with customer service via chat to perfect the user experience for our customers. Looking forward to sharing this app with many people. Already showing to be a lifesaver after one release today during Black Friday. The Auto merge was unbelievably helpful.
"We couldn’t be happier with Flavor Cloud. They make international shipping a breeze (words I never thought I would say). They eliminate the stress of having to deal with customs speed bumps, their rates are reasonable, shipments are all easily tracked, and the up-front payment of duties and taxes mean our customers get their product that much faster and don’t receive any expensive surprise fee’s upon delivery. The few problems we’ve had have been short lived as the Flavor Cloud team is very quick to respond to emails and help resolve the issue. Excellent customer service! The user interface of the app becomes intuitive after a short learning curve and you can tell they’re working hard to refine the experience. All in all, a top-notch international shipping service!"
"Rebuy has a lot of features to easily boost AOV and provide a better user experience for customers, such as the smart cart. We wanted a standalone bundle page which wasn't an out of the box solution for Rebuy, but their amazing technical team coded it for us in a few days and its working perfectly. Highly recommend using this app, it quickly pays for itself."
Was struggling with the user interface but their assistance was really great and they wallked me through each step. Flynn Ramos is really great and was super helpful!
"We have a custom theme and getting the app to work for us was not the easiest thing, but it was totally worth sticking it out. Our site now looks awesome, and the user experience is really good. Their support team is really great. And the functionalities of the app are amazing, its like 10 apps in one."
"This is actually a great app. One star because I was very clear from the start that I needed to do cross-border returns (US returns need to generate a USPS return label to send the return back to us in Canada). This app cannot do this. One star for me doing days of configuration only to realize it can't meet our most basic requirement - a requirement I was explicit about with the support folks I chatted with extensively. If you need to ship returns within Canada or within the US - 5 stars. It's a great app. It's easy to use. The interface for configuration is straightforward with just enough power to enable complex rules and exclusions. The user experience is really nice too. I'm annoyed that we can't use this tool. The support staff were regularly available, easy to chat with and generally very proactive and helpful. I'm just annoyed at having wasted so much time."
"Muito bom, interface intuitiva, vale a pena. recomendo! No começo achei um pouco dificil de usar mas fui aprendendo aos pouco."
"I really wanted to like this app - simple, straightforward interface. App's admin area has slots for IP, country, white and blacklist. Unfortunately you can spend quite some time entering information only to have it disappear a day or two later. Tried three times then deleted app. Developer is eager to fix things - if your install is not time sensitive you might give this a try"
"I was so pleased to find this app when searching for how to get rid of the bright PayPal button on the first step of the checkout process. I was even more pleased to find out how easy it was to implement, how incredible and quick the customer support was (thanks, Billy!), and how much better it really makes the user experience. Thanks!"
"Best price of all the other social media login apps for $1.99 mo. vs. $4.99 and up. Also, I had some trouble getting this set up due to a Google Analytics, and I wrote them and they fixed it IMMEDIATELY. They told me how to fix it, but before I had the chance they went ahead and did it. This saved me a good 30-min to an always busy day. And that doesn't even tell you about the ease of use, seamless user interface, and quality design. You get the option to change and customize the social media login buttons color for the aesthetically obsessed. So you can have a pale orange-pink for google instead of the clashing, garish red, etc. Don't waste your time with others. I tried them about 4-5 and they were harder to use and more expensive. This is one, two, three done... if you have ANY trouble, send them an email they respond in 3 hours or less. Problem solved. Never had service like this level with an app/plugin, etc."
"WOW! I interviewed a few different Loyalty platforms before selecting Loyalty Lion and I AM SO HAPPY THAT I SELECTED THEM! Not only was the initial sales person informative, but the on-boarding was AMAZING! Sophie was incredible. We went through the entire program in under 45 minutes and I was ready to go! The interface is simple, yet you can make it as advanced as you want with all of their integrations they allow. We LOVE this program, it integrates will into the shopify platform! THANK YOU!"
"Easy to use, simple interface for the user to add additional products to their basket, and absolutely first rate support from the W3 support centre to get the app working with our theme. We are a small web agency and we love this app and have used it on a number of our clients' websites. 5stars!"
"Great app!
Pros - Easy linking interface, has not noticeably affected site speed and load times, very customisable (be prepared to work with style sheets to customise it to match your theme), good price, great customer support!
Cons - Cannot choose a product not to display accessory if you choose site wide default accessories, cannot easily choose quick menu to display hero image only
Having worked with support and CSS, I am extremely happy with how this looks and runs on our website."
"I was looking for a way to write and save customized Shopify reports - and this app is just great. Not only is the user interface intuitive - the pre-built reports are useful, exportable and modifiable. Also, support is super responsive and knowledgeable - thank you!"
"They force you to make it live on your website before you can fully test and understand their interface. Once you install you realise you pay for everything including some ""enhancements"" ranging from $5-10 that to me are standard features that make it useable. Don't force making it live from the get go before the customer can fully understand your product and be transparent about your prices and you might have something"
This app is doing its work even if is free. It has a simple interface and use and that is making me be satisfied.
Fast and efficient customer support who thinks along and offers solutions. The app is convenient to use and the user experience is now many times more enjoyable.
"Are you drop shipping? I researched the top 9 drop shipping apps in this category and only one met our robust needs. Get Duoplane.
When I took a chance with Duoplane, I didn't know the following:
    - They take customer service seriously. Their team is responsive and results oriented. Duoplane has helped us address several special business needs through additional training on Duoplane and releasing new features.
    - Our vendors like using Duoplane. This is key to managing our vendor relationships because we can't expect them to use our systems unless they also derive value from it. Each of our vendors has appreciated the simplicity of the Duoplane interface and the ease of use to carrying out critical supply chain functions, like sending POs to the right vendors, knowing the status of every single item/unit on every PO and Order, and being able to manager service level agreements with transparency.
    - Duoplane integrates with ShipStation
I could go on but I'll offer you something better. If you want a reference as to why I picked Duoplane and how we implemented Duoplane, ask them to share my contact info with you and we can correspond.
Cheers!

"This is hands down the most effective and powerful Shopify app we use. Since launching our company in 2012, we have been trying to find a way to manage the drop shipping side of our business. We were incredibly grateful to discover Duoplane this past summer. It transformed our business on day 1. It is very easy to use and has a clean user interface. Additionally, we have had a standout customer service experience with them.  They've helped us strategize better systems for our shipping model and have been incredibly successful at customizing different features of the app to adapt to our needs. 
We could not be more pleased with Duoplane and highly recommend this app. It has dramatically improved our business!"
"A MUST for anyone looking to automate their online store with multiple vendors/drop shippers/affiliate suppliers etc. We where previously using another app that was similar to Duoplane, but it was lacking an interface for vendors to log into and see orders (as well as a few other features we where looking for).  This App works seamlessly with shopify, and is extremely easy to use. 
Duoplane allows our vendors and whole sellers to log in, print purchase orders, packing slips, as well as see previously shipped orders within a separate interface from our actual Shopify back end. 
We love the notes feature that allows you to communicate with your vendors within each order. We also like that each vendor gets their own ""portal"" that breaks down all of their orders and information pertaining to their orders as well. Vendors can also specify promise dates for us to see, and Duoplane will alert you if an order has passed its promise date without being shipped. We also use Duoplane for the inventory tracking feature. This allows us to not have to import daily CSV files to vendors that supply us with daily inventory counts via a csv file. Duoplane can automate the process, and will update the inventory automatically with vendors that supply a webpage with a place to download inventory data. These features allow us to not have to deal with a multitude of backorders, which makes everyone happy in the process. 
When we downloaded the app, Sina was extremely helpful in getting us set up. He spent a good 1/2 hour on the phone with me showing me how to use Duoplane and set it up to our needs. The customer service has been top notch, and they have gotten back to me quickly with any questions I have about the app. I also liked the fact that when I was speaking with Sina, we mentioned that they will be continually finding ways of making Duoplane better as well as add more features down the road. 
If you are looking for a feature packed inventory/order management system or if you are looking to automate your website (or websites) ordering process, Duoplane will definitely be your choice!"
Great simple app which just does what it says with a sleek customisable interface. Some of the fastest and most helpful customer service adds bonus points to the experience.
"It's a very useful app with a simple interface - works quite nicely, responsive support with some minor issues, but everyone's website is a little different so that's to be expected."
"Great app, the interface is very intuitive and easy to use, and the support is very prompt and helpful!"
The customer support was totally amazing. Super quick to respond and take action.  They helped me customize the layout so text wasn't wrapping for store hours.  It is very intuitive and easy to use the interface. Great store locator analytics reports.  I highly recommend!
"The app is easy to use, the interface user friendly. It's features work well with our store. The costumer service is prompt and very thoughtful. Overall my experience with this app has been great Will update in the feature if needed."
Easy interface to work with and the customer service team are super diligent. They reached out to me not the other way round and we had a really useful zoom call to optimise the platform
"Stockist is great! I love that it uses a page for integration so you can add additional content onto the page. Works great on mobile and the map directions feature, tags, and field customizations are great for user experience! Bonus: the team is very responsive and accommodating!"
"Very easy interface and set up, works smoothly and fully automatic! Highly recommented for every store."
"ShipUp clearly saved us a lot of time and made our customers happy. We and our customers love their notification e-mails and text messages. Moreover, the interface is really intuitive, easy to use and customer support is amazing! I can only recommend this app! Thank you ShipUp!"
"The app interface is excellent, intuitive and fast-loading, with all the information I need on the TrackiPal orders list. Being able to click on the Item ID (go to the Shopify order), the Trans. ID (go to the order on the PayPal page), and the Tracking no. (go to the order on the shipper's page) is incredibly helpful. This is a delightful, unintended benefit, the ability to see all of the order, payment, and shipping information from one page. John B. on the chat was extremely helpful and patient answering my questions on my first day. The day after installing this app, I checked several orders and the tracking information for all of them had posted to PayPal accurately. This looks like a ""set it and forget it"" app, and I am very happy with it."
"This app is broken. It is supposed to not attempt to sync items that are archived or not available to the eBay channel. Unfortunately the developer turned that off, so now it forces you to sync items you have zero on hand, archived items and items that are not available to eBay to eBay. So when you add a product, you may have to wade through pages and pages of zero on hand items to find the item you want to add. The user interface for adding the eBay fields is also terrible. You cant tab from field to field, you have to grab the mouse, click into the field, then select a pull down. Imagine doing that for (our business) auto parts. Guess how makes there were in any given date range? It'd be much easier if you could just tab to the field, type ""Mercedes"" and move on to the model instead of having to click the make field then scroll down to Mercedes and click it. Requests for improvements are either ignored or referred to the online support bulletins, last updated years ago. Find an alternative if you can."
"Whilst the interface is a little clunky it does work. Unfortunately it's missing two key features, which means I will be uninstalling it. Firstly, there's no rules so you can't just increase all your prices by a certain percentage to list to eBay. It has to be manually done per product. This also means you can't set a template to use for products. Secondly, it doesn't have the ability to add a sales tax line to the order. It looks like inkfrog has this capability. This is pretty important to sync our orders from Shopify into our accounting software as it decides eBay sales coming through to it are missing tax and add it on!"
"This app was really helpful in syncing our Shopify products to Etsy. It was an easy interface to understand even without the demos they provided. I did have some difficulty with a few things, but customer service was responsive and helped me through them. Kabin, Fazil and Surya were really pleasant and seemed committed to finding a solution for whatever challenge I had."
I used the app to move my Shopify products to my Etsy store. The app worked well but figuring out how to get the products in the store was a little confusing. You have to have specific shipping and selling settings in order to get the products listed. After I figured out my way around the interface it was pretty easy to use.
Sold by the idea of the app that allowed customers the flexibility to edit product variants without having to leave the cart page. Dhruvi was responsive and helpful in making style adjustments so that it would display seamlessly. Great tool for any fledging ecommerce business that is looking to improve and streamline online user experience. Thank you!
This app really improves the overall user experience. Makes the experience so much better & the tech team was able to quickly address my issues and resolve them within 48 hours. Highly recommend!
Excellent. Easy to use. Good on boarding experience with Fawiz. Integrates both ways with easy to use interface.
Very helpful dev team and the app helps a great deal with user experience and allowing customers to have access to changes within their cart. Would love an option whereby the options were available without clicking 'change' as well in future!
"Didn't work for us. Don't know how people have given 5-star ratings. 1) Firstly, they don't have decent courier options like bluedart or FedEx. Only metro cities get these courier options. 2) No one came to pick up the parcel when we used ecom /delhivery as per their insistence. 3) order tracking link(for delhivery/Ecom) on shopify takes you to DHL tracking page!! 4) New orders are not synced from shopify even after repeated attempts. 5) interface is too complex unlike others and there is no one click booking. 6) You cannot cancel an order on your own if you want to change/ cancel the courier for some reason. 7) Customer support only provides lip service just like other shipping aggregators. We tried this app after reading the positive reviews but it turned out to be worse than the ones we are currently using."
"As a start up this is the best platform to use , easy to navigate & user friendly interface , support team is just a call away and provide resolution within a TAT of 24-48 hrs. Big thumps up for this app."
"We've found this to be a very useful app in taking our CLV efforts to the next level. The interface is clean and simple (exactly what you want) and there's a huge amount of data, displayed in an insightful way so that it's not overwhelming. The integration with Explore is so useful for tracking NPS by segment as well... And the TEAM!! Best support experience I've ever had with a SaaS. Thanks everyone for your ongoing support. Download this app!!!"
"Pros: Good support by the customer support team, team really helps a lots through integration process. Well system interface is very User friendly. Features are also good which compliment the pricing.
Cons: It will be great if team could confirm any timeline related to any issue or Feature, that will really help us to manage the things accordingly."
"Reveal has helped us clearly define our customers segments, along with providing data we can translate into action to retain customers and improve our user experience. Their team is also super hands on and very helpful!"
"After searching for a tool to help us analyze our customer data and improve retention and conversion rates, we installed Reveal. This tool ticks all the boxes and presents data in a highly visual, clean interface. One of the most valuable features of the platform is the segmentation of customers according to the dimensions of recency, frequency, and monetary value (RFM). Combined with other data points on buying behavior, Reveal enables us to communicate with our customers in a much more personalized and relevant way. Plus, the team at Omniconvert is really friendly and helpful. We had a great product tour with Teodor, who explained the platform in detail and answered our questions. 100% recommended!"
"I have been using this App since 2 years now and they BEST you can use for all your shipping and order processing. Excellent interface, loaded with features and very easy to use. I highly recommend them. Shipping and Return handling is easy."
The good interface provided by the app. Work becomes smoother for us via using this app. now we Can process our 100 orders in few mins which saves us lots of time. New features are good. Would like to suggest this app to all Shopify users.
"This app is ridiculous. The $5 doesn't even give you a way to input any results. To do anything functional, you have to purchase the $20 plan. Just stick to Visual Quiz Builder. UPDATE: So I tried their new update and it was much better and useful. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the user interface. It's not as modern as I would've liked, but it still got the job done. Good job to the team for the improvements."
"Great integrator tool! User interface looks great and it is easy to customize for your own business. Amazing customer service support, you can always reach out with any queries and expect a timely response. They are very reliable and always want make sure all you questions are answered. Would definitely suggest to others."
I love the simple user interface in Ako. Easy to retarget. Although I am still at the measuring stage of my campaigns. Will need to see how well these campaigns perform & I'll do an update on this review then.
"Rewardify does what it says - it creates store credit for customers and lets you import store credit as well. It also has a suite of features that would be quite useful for wholesales or businesses that are reliant on store credit as a marketing tool. Having said that, it did not suit our purposes. Using store credit cancels out the ability for the customer to use discounts, because Rewardify saves the store credit as a discount, and Shopify does not allow discounts to be stacked. I also found their user interface to be unintuitive, and their documentation unhelpful."
"This app is such a life saver!!! We have tried many different live chat app, such as Zendesk and Facebook Messenger, but Channel.io beats all of them by far.
- Here's the pros :
1. Beautiful and easy to use user interface
2. Free plan is available -> unlimited on site live chats
3. Desktop and mobile dashboard app available
4. If your target is Asian market, than it might be very useful because it allows connection with Line and Kakaotalk.
5. Through the paid plan, you can set up marketing pop up messages beautifully. It encourages more people to click on the message, and you can specify your target customers to show each messages to.
6. Interactive chat-bot. It's easy to set up different support-bot for customers most asked question. For example, we set up one regarding general FAQ, and another one specifically for product questions. The click rate for these are very high!
6. Super duper supportive and quick support!!! Thank you Bora ❤️
- Things to improve:
1. This app is based in Korea, so currently some of its material are still not quite well translated. However personally I don't think it hinders the use of the app at all. Though a more thorough English guide would certainly be great!
2. Would love to see Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger be added!"
"Honest thoughts after installing this app:
- pros: suitable if you're targeting Asian (Korean and Japanese) markets, clean user interface. - cons: It makes you sign up
- and seems to collect your customers and your shop's data
- Installation process is longer than other apps
- Relatively expensive pricing for the services provided - Not suitable for the American/western markets
- Its reviews seem to be unreliable as they're mostly published on the same date
- Not really different from already existing chatting apps"
"Great App! We use this on a regular basis for customer service and find customers prefer getting store credit vs. a coupon code. We've also integrated this through  a webhook to our 3rd party referral program and it works great! Customers love earning store credit. Very easy to integrate.
Jesse was also fantastic with on-boarding helping us style the tool. The interface is easy to use and requires minimal setup time.  Some dev work required if you'd like to customize your account page.
You can see our live integration here if you're logged in:
www.vitruvi.com 
We also integrated rewardify into our referral program which you can see here:
www.vitruvi.com/pages/refer-a-friend"
Great app with great dashboard to track profits. Nice interface and friendly support staff to help with questions.
"This is a great app that quickly shows you how much profit you are earning. The interface is robust and easy to understand. Kinky Toy Store
https://www.kinkytoy.store/"
"So far so good, very clean interface, I love many features - one of my faves is ability to schedule WHEN you get the profit report. I don't get vendor shipping costs until next morning, so this gives our team time to enter actual shipping costs into the app b4 the profit email summary is sent. I had a feature request to be able to toggle on/off the marketing/adspend in P&L calculations and the developers were quick to respond. Just waiting for Bing to be connected so I don't have to manually do that. Very happy so far."
Interface design and customer service are great! I look forward to seeing the third-party fulfillment services' integrations!
"WOW! I dont do many reviews but this is worth it. The support from Raphael and the team has been incredible. They are always available and always so easy to communicate with and help get you set up. The interface and metrics and reports are amazing, If you are running any type of ecommerce business id highly recommend this as a simple plug in. The app and the team are top class!"
"Best Profit-Tracking App here, as it supports multiple adspent variants, nice interface, most flexible shipping and COG system etc. and not to forget the worldclass provided support by raphael."
"Very good App..great interface. Hopefully, this will give us a great view of our store finances in one place."
"Easy to use, straightforward interface. Set it up in 5 min"
Good looking and user friendly interfaceApp has alot of features to track your profit easy. Customer Service is happy to help.
Just got this app and was very impressed with the interface and ease of use. Looking forward to see the results of my re-marketing campaigns.
"I tried this app 2-3 years ago when I launched my store. My theme doesn't allow for a lot of section customization other than images so I found this app helpful. I outgrew the older version of this app and sought out apps with more modern layouts, font, etc. I returned back after I outgrew the two apps I was using to create the look I wanted. I was excited to find that they completely revamped their user interface and customizations for sections. After using the new version of the app to re-design our website, I love this app again. Great customer service, too. I highly recommend,"
"I wanted to add a subscription to my store, but the Shopify pages builder didn't give me any realize design flexibility, so after another page building app failed to deliver effective service, I switched to Page Studio. I bumped into an issue with Embedded code, and reached out. Jordin was all over it and got things working quickly. This has allowed us to create a much better user experience. Thanks guys!!!"
"I have found the app pretty intuitive to use, and it has some great features, like social media blocks. But as with any third party user interface, there are limitations on the functionality without deep diving into the code.  For example, some of the column formatting does not translate well across device sizes."
"Still in the free trial, but so far, this app has been a game changer! Here's hoping this is the solution to many wasted hours of clunky shopify design workarounds. The user interface is easy and professional, and the integration with existing pages is frankly amazing. Customization is limited by pre-built content blocks, but there are a lot, and I've been told I'll be notified when/if the block I want to use is implemented. Great, responsive customer service from Anh."
"Incredible support from the Shop Pad team. Whenever you have an issue they'll respond super quickly, and are always more than happy to help! User interface can be a little bit buggy at sometimes, but all problems can be sorted! Makes designing a website, very easy, especially if you have minimal coding experience"
"These folks are great and super-responsive. I was at a standstill in developing the kind of site I wanted and then I got Page Studio and am now on FIRE. Getting a TON accomplished very quickly, page-after-page, precisely like I want. Modern, responsive - let me develop an outstanding user experience. And FAST. I hit a couple of snags and the ShopPad folks bailed me out with a super-quick reply before things cooled off on my end ... and now I am back with it. I have accomplished more in less than a day than I could have spent hundreds of dollars hiring out the work."
"by far the best review app I've been used. believe me I've tested a lot. It's the most amount of reviews per product for the money's worth, so long as you don't have thousands of products. The interface is fast, clean and working like a charm. Pity is it doesn't support auto install at least for my theme but support is extremely helpful, so what else can you ask for?"
"After installing and uninstalling quite a few of the most popular back in stock apps ( due to frustrations around design/layout etc.), I found this app to have the best interface and backend layout/design. I just got my first orders from the app & I am delighted with it. The customer service is exceptional, the app does exactly what you need & I can't recommend it enough."
"Amazing app with an accessible user interface , on top of all the support was great and very fast to respond and assist me during installation. strongly recommended!!"
"Awesome for SEO and cross linking products and collections. If you have more than a few products, this Auto Linking app automatically creates the links for you. Let's say you write a few blogs, and have a few products. No one has time to go back and manually create links to the new products or blogs. This automatically does it for you. SEO, when google comes to index your site they follow links, the better cross linked your site is, the better they will rank you. User experience and selling. Customers can hit one item on your site, but you can link to other similar and they will be able to find more inventory and hopefully buy... This APP is amazing and probably one of the most important for SEO and Customer Experience.
No, this is not a fake review, you are welcome to visit our site and see it in use."
"The app works really well, it does what it should. I find some of the interface could be more straight forward inside the app but overall it delivers on what we need. Support has also been helpful."
"I tried 3 country redirection apps, Cozy is the best one.
user friendly interface plus very helpful customer support.
Chloe has been very patience on our requests, and made it happen!"
"The user interface is easy to navigate, and the customer service is extremely fast and resourceful! This app was an excellent find."
I spent weeks with Shopify experts trying to achieve a seamless enduser experience for customers in different locations with no success. Some creative searches on my part and the discovery of Eazy solved a problem the experts couldn't. Great product and great support. Their terrific support team even inserted code in my theme to optimise the redirection speed. What a treat!
"Had a minor configuration issue and Peter was super quick to respond to my email and got me fixed up right away. Simple, straightforward, great looking App with a user friendly interface and excellent customer service. Definitely would recommend."
help is too good they do help with coding must install using since 3 months tooo good and fantastic user experience
"The app is good, it has some very good customization options (which not all apps with a free plan have). They have a small issue where when you deactivate the app or change its configurations it takes some time for those changes to appear on your page. Other than that, the app is great, and customer service is top-notch. I needed support and received an answer instantly on their chat. Alexander was very attentive and helped me get things sorted. Overall the experience with this app is good. As constructive feedback I would suggest improving those delays when you change configurations or deactivate the app, that would bring a much better user experience. Will give it 5 stars because I think the support was very good and the app works as intended, except for those small issues."
"Uninstalled after 3 minutes. Too bad user interface - did not understand how it worked but it screwed up our filters, so we have to pay a developer for fixing it :(
I cannot recommend this app."
Looks Great! Wish it was more user friendly... An interface that you can use within the collection page builder would be much better than having to write code or pay $25 for them to do the coding for you. Love the concept.. But dont like the usability
"Does what it says! Has a great easy to use interface, nothing completed at all! The notify me button can be adjusted with colours which is great! I like the fact this developer has not been greedy with their plan costs which makes it much more cost effective and a good choice which definitely helps customers when choosing apps!"
Very easy interface! We loved it very much. Anybody can do with little knowledge. One time pricing is also very attractive.
"Very clunky interface that is hard to use. Product mapping between channels is not thought out well. Also, product import makes no sense as the CSV has to be re-formatted and there is no mention of this until you contact the support. Customer service eventually starts ignoring you."
"Great app and very user friendly interface, fantastic customer helped to set up step by step! I recommend it ! Thank you!"
100% RECOMMENDED. It helped me a lot to automatically link my Shopify business with my Instagram shop. They also have 24/7 service where they guide you in every single step in case you struggle like me. The interface of this app is good but the service received by their employees is incredible.
"Flawless and very speedy support from Marius at SuppleApps, and a great functional app in general. Adds the final touches to the user experience on my shopify store. Would highly recommend!"
"I love the functionality but the interface is a little convoluted and takes a minute to figure out. After tinkering with the app, I was able to set up the discount I needed. Customer service was quick to respond to my questions. Would use it again."
"I was unaware of the ADA's accessibility law. Since learning about the law, I had to look for a viable solution for my business. Thankfully I found Accessibility Enabler and easily installed into onto our site. Their interface is perfect for what we were looking for, the pricing was what we budgeted out and the icon is minimal. Would definitely recommend this app!"
"I wasn't aware of accessibility law before. Soon after I learned about this law, I took my first step by installing the Accessibility Enabler app. I like their accessibility interface design. It doesn't cover the whole screen like other apps here and very users friendly. I made a quick comparison and found none of the other apps provide as many options as this app gives. The support team was quick to answer my request. That's what impressed me a lot. I see this app is an affordable option for accessibility. I would highly recommend it to others."
Looked at all of the popular zoom apps.  This by far had the best user experience on desktop and mobile.
"Enjoy using the simple interface. Great ability to use a distinct description for each variant. Fast, efficient and friendly support - and coding issue I had was resolved."
"This app allows me to target larger customer base with additional payment option. It has a user friendly interface and works perfectly, what it promises.
The support team responds immediately and have the experize to resolve requested enhancement."
"If there's any doubt in your mind whether this is the right solution for you, just go ahead and run the trial and your doubts will surely be alleviated. This is an incredibly well-designed piece of software (and I say that as a seasoned software developer myself). As well as its core features being extremely slick, each time I use it, I find more and more handy little power-user features that I didn't spot previously. We've gone from manually searching our inventory for stock to order (and making assumptions about what sells well), writing this all down into an email whilst also cross-referencing vendor references from price lists, sending 'PO' emails and remembering to check back each day for updates and then finally receiving the order and painstakingly updating inventory quantities into Shopify. We now just navigate to Inventory Planner, click the Replenishment tab, select the products that are forecast to go out of stock and hit 'Create PO'. We then email this to the vendor using the handy Email function and all the vendor references that we've previously entered and automatically added to each line item in the PO. Once the stock arrives, we check the stock received against the system and then hit 'Receive All', which in turn then automatically updates Shopify with all the incoming stock amounts. That's it. The whole process has gone from an entire evening of creating a PO and then another entire evening of updating stock, to a process that takes us no more than 10 minutes for each part. I can't even begin to explain how much stress this has alleviated from what was previously a very laborious task (and sometimes error-prone!) Even with its base functionality, it's invaluable, but for e.g, we found the other day that we could also automatically print barcodes for all the received stock. This is a process that would have taken us at least 1-2 hours as our previous system involved exporting product data, making data changes in Excel and then finally uploading to a specialist barcode printing app to make the final prints (which was laborious even in itself). Now, all we do is receive the items into stock and then hit 'Print Labels', which in turn prints a single label for every item we've just received. Better yet, we've been able to convert our existing label design onto Inventory Planner easily as it allows for infinite customizability due to the ability to use custom HTML/CSS (if desired). Support has been amazing. There's been a few occasions where we felt that perhaps something could be done slightly better, or a tweak made to improve the user experience and they've handled these requests perfectly, each time taking the feedback on board and in all situations have returned to me with a workable solution in record time. I've honestly been very impressed at how much they actually care about the customer experience and their ability to implement improvements so quickly. I could go on for far too long about how much time and stress this software has saved us. Needless to say, we're a customer for life!"
Inventory Planner changed our entire approach to the inventory aspect of our business. It was such a smooth onboarding process and intuitive interface. Can't say enough about this platform.
This app turned calculating how much to order from hours to literally 10min. Uploaded 2 years of sales data in 5 minutes. Easy import and export of data. Great integration with Shopify to grab product data and update received inventory. Then it drops the PO into QBO to make reconciling and paying the invoice a breeeeze. We had a number of use cases that required tweeks to the app and they were always open to ideas and delivered tweeks quickly. We purchase about 1300 unique items that are sold in about 3000 variants from nearly 100 vendors. Great value and looking forward to future options to order by the case and set case pricing! Thank you everyone at inventory planner. Been using this app for a year now......once you understand how it works the interface is so informative.....so not only does it recommend wha t you should buy to can see and adjust all the information and forecast settings impacting that recommendation. Before we had 2 people doing purchasing.....now we can do purchasing in 2 hours. Perhaps the best part of this app is the team behind the scenes. Jill is amazing and they actually listen to product improvement ideas and implement them. Not the normal......we'll add it to the list and then nothing every happens. One of the best value apps we have discovered.
"This app really helped change the prices in my store with ease. I add thousands of items to my store at a time and really needed a heavy hitting app that could do the work. A great little feature is that they keep your changes so that if you need to revert the prices back you can. The interface is very intuitive and user friendly. The people that run this app are very responsive if there ever is an issue. If you have ideas about features you might want on the app, just talk to them. These folks have customer service done right. I look forward to seeing where they go from here."
"What a great app! SUPER easy to change prices on all or some of your products and even schedule the change to revert to the previous price. GREAT for sales! I find the interface extremely intuitive. Was using a Bold app before and I like this one better, and it's less money!"
"Before choosing a print-on-demand service I tested at least four. And to be honest none of them really impressed me. Across the board, common problems for me were file size limitations, customer support availability, and any kind of focus. High-quality prints do not come from a 20MB file, paying a monthly or annual fee should buy me telephone support from a happy human, and printing on shoes, T-Shirts, coffee mugs, etc is not fine art printing. If this sounds like the issue you're having I strongly recommend giving Pictorem a try. For a very fair annual fee, you receive all of those features plus some nice unexpected ones like the ability to watermark your images with your own logo. The user interface is really intuitive for a bran new app and exporting your products is super straightforward. If you want a service that specializes in fine art prints Pictorem is your solution. Giclée's on multiple paper types and canvas, wood, brushed metal, HD metal sublimation, acrylic, and even puzzles! Hands down, Pictorem is the best option for artists or photographers who are only interested in printing their work on the absolute best mediums. Should you ever run into a problem, Fabien will be awaiting your call to help you."
"Gelato uses a simple interface, offers a decent variety of products, and the integration is pretty seamless."
"It has a fairly easy one click install on shopify, but unless you have only one product on your entire store, this is not for you. Does it create an affiliate dashboard, yes. But if you actually want your affiliates to have a good user experience (setting up their affiliate links for the products they like on your shop), the user experience is horrible. You have to activate SubID and then you have to send the link to the SubID page where your affiliates then create their links. It's not even linked to from the main dashboard. ? It's already hard enough to get affiliates who have a big reach to work with you, let alone trying to get them to remember to go to the SubID page to set up their links. Not a very sustainable solution. Support did exist, but emails took around 3 days to respond. Not angry, just being honest as a real business owner. Improve your user experience and maybe we'll come back. :)"
"Gelato has very high-quality products for print on demand, a very simple interface, and simple and transparent ordering Now I work with gelato for more than 6 months as a drop shipper in a mug shop. I have to admit that gelato has very high-quality cups and their print is really very high quality. The whole system with gelato from order to dispatch is very simple. Even the print settings are easy. Their support is very fast and if you need help they have professional people to help you. I highly recommend it to anyone who needs a great service to print-on-demand items. I will definitely be working with them again."
"Worth investment for your online beat store. Been searching for something that functions as a beat store and stream player. Interface is straightforward. Allows you to have multiple licenses for a beat and you can edit any metadata for your beats. Did have an issue where I couldn't upload WAVS (zips,mp3,and artworked uploaded fine) after a recent update but customer service was able to help me out same day. Salute. Overall, excited to launch my store soon and this app made it possible! In my experience, big win for the independent producer. Wouldn't say its perfect yet but there is not many other options as good as this one. Hope they continue to update the app. IF YOU COULD ALSO HAVE THE STRTEAM PLAYER PLAY WHEN NOT SELECTED ON A SPECIFIC TRACK AND WHILE SCROLLING THROUGH OTHER TRACKS THAT WOULD BE SICK TOO! That way, you don't have to select a track every time to play it or switch tracks. App still dope though"
Deidra Start support agent blew my mind!  She was fast and super informative.  I'm surprised with how leaddyno interface is compared to the other networks.  Will give it a go and see!
"Nice app! Helpful to not let anyone steal/copy your website information.
and interface is also good."
I found this app very uselful and its not hard to use at all. Im new to shopify and really like the interface and features
Very useful app! Helps drive sales and increased user experience for our customers. Tech support is very useful when help is needed.
"Nice app and great support. Easy user interface, clean, and simple. It was very easy to set up my order status page and I could choose colours to blend with my theme colours. I would hope to see you introduce a sales funnel to the trackr in future. Also, the app came cheap. Thank you."
"Such a fantastic app. The pricing is extremely fair, the interface is nice and easy to use and the customer service is top notch and friendly! I definitely recommend :)"
"Love it!! Amazing app! Friendly interface, lots of style options, great customer service. No glitches. 100% happy with it!"
"I use this app to help me add extra accordion on product page. Works very well and fit the theme. Super easy to use, great interface and functionality. The support is amazing, very fast response all the time, friendly and professional."
"I have been using Machine Labs for a couple of months now and after testing several apps I am glad to have finally settled on this one. The interface is very easy to use and there's a walkthrough for each section to make sure you hit the ground running. The templates are great and you can search for stickers and gifs to use on Giphy from within the app making it easy and convenient to find content when creating email campaigns. I did have a couple of minor issues which Emma escalated to the dev team and resolved very quickly, their support has been fantastic! All in all I have been very impressed with this app, the features and ease of use, I am looking forward to creating more campaigns and building my business with Machine Labs."
"The app is really intuitive, very easy to navigate and get your campaign starting in no time, and the interface is very neat. The support team is also very attentive and reliable. Highly recommended."
"Solid app - has helped our customers track their own packages. Interface is easy to use, has good options and support is always friendly, ready to help and efficient too!  Thanks."
"Great app! Highly recommend.easy to set up, beautiful interface, fast customer support service. 5 stars."
Fantastic app with an intuitive installation and user experience. Good looking designs and options on the free tier. Super easy to use. Thank you!
"I have created my own form builder, and I love it to pop out on my website and attracting more customers to becoming our brand ambassador. The pricing is a bit pricy for a pro plan and hopefully can have some adjustments! In overall, the whole thing and interface is so clear and easy to use and it merges all data around my website. Very convenient and adequate! Nice one ☝️"
"Great customer support and interface, I would highly recommend to others who are seeking to utilize an affiliate program :)"
"Installed this tonight. Support were proactive and reached out to see if I have any issues. Interface looks intuitive and lots of features available. Will give a more thorough review once I've used it for a few weeks. So far, looks very promising."
Their customer service is so fast to respond and the interface is so easy to navigate. Amazing app! Definitely recommend!!
Ik heb deze app net opgezet. Ging super vlot en ook super dat alles gratis is. Je kan je eigen domein koppelen en de interface is gebruiksvriendelijk! Ook bij het opzetten de support gecontacteerd en zeer vriendelijk ontvangen en tevreden met de service die we gekregen hebben!
Great support and easy interface to work with. Love the simplicity of the apps interface. Makes recruiting affiliates very simple.
"I tried a few of these Instagram Feed and I have to say, without a doubt, this app is by far the best one. The user interface as well as the customer service has been outstanding and I love how it integrates with our instagram account with such ease. I cannot recommend this app enough and deserves more than 5 stars"
awesome app! Really loved customer support! Especially they are very quick in responding and their user interface is very great
"Very robust feature set with several integration options, several file format options, and an easy intuitive user interface.  Processed several large files very quickly.  No complaints - solid product that does what it says, and does it well."
Excellent customer service and an easy interface to start your affiliate program. Great app for Shopify! Saved me a ton of time getting our program off the ground.
Excellent Interface to gauge inventory holding + value.Support from Mete was highly efficient………………….
"We love this app and have yet to use it to its fullest potential. One reason why we have stayed with Merchbees for this long is because their tech support is incredible. They not only answer my questions but follow up to let us know they have made improvements on previous questions I've asked. The app is always improving so we know this is a long term solution for us. We would not invest this much time and effort into an app if they did not: 1) Provide such great customer support 2) Continue to develop and improve their app 3) Excel in communication Thanks Merchbees, we appreciate the contribution you make to making our Shopify store a better user experience for our backend team."
Useless interface. Makes it all impossible to understand (:
"I like it so much with WhatsApp integrations, it helps me a lot. Recommended App！The UI interface is clear."
"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! Easy interface to quickly set up the estimation on your store, but it doesn't work. They have very poor customer service. I emailed them about the issue of the order delivery estimation not being displayed on my website and they replied 4 days later saying "" let me check"" without any greeting or anything. Sounded like you were messaging some random person. Anyways, I waited a couple of days and no one got back to me. So I sent them an email again asking if there was any update and again 3 days went by and no one got back to me. Apparently this is an ongoing issue faced by other store owners too. You'd think it would be fixed by now."
"I used this app to help with my email curation and wanted something I can do mobile because I use my phone a lot. Omg I love this app and the developers they actually gave me a 10,000 email limit doubling it from 5,000 and I’m still on the FREE plan!!! They are so generous and very helpful and timely..easy interface and can start creating emails quickly! Download and try for yourself!"
Easy to use. Easy interface. Conveniently integrated for my shop . It was really useful when Shopify didn't have an inherent marketing tool. It's still a value add with great templates to choose from!
Super easy interface to use and customer service went above and beyond to help out my small business!
"We've been using Smartrmail for almost a year and we must say, their service is timely, friendly and efficient. We are impressed with the quality of their customer support every time we reach out for assistance. The interface has only gotten better recently with the revamping of their website which offers way more functions. Thank you Smartrmail team for all you do and we do hope you stay around for years to come, you are an example of the kind of small business we like to work with!"
"So we needed a simple solution for our merchandise and Slaite delivered high quality options! Is the app perfect? No, but given how it’s only been a year I will say that what they have done has been impressive! Pros:
- lots of options for clothes, and since it’s print on demand you can design to your hearts intent
- affordable costs for both the clothes and shipping - great customer support and user experience Cons:
- no international shipping options
- limited shipping options. They could only ship directly from their wear house. I’d love the ability to override shipping to a retail location/intermediate facility for holding while also keeping the record intact on my orders page
- the ui for designing the clothes can be buggy
- the pregenerated images put on the site aren’t transparent, which sucks for theming Will we still use them in the future? Absolutely we love the service and it is amazing. Fix the cons I currently have though and you’ll have a way better experience."
"Honestly, being new to Shopify and e-commerce in general, I have to say it feels like I have an all-star team with Adriana & her husband in our corner. Very communicative and went above and beyond for my business! Long last impressing---CHECK! Customer service and user interface of app is top notch and straight forward respectively."
"beautiful interface. Easy to use. Free version gives more of the features you need. No regrets, I would definitely consider upgrading"
"I use this app to run a subscription box product on my e-commerce website. I absolutely love the clean user interface! When the app had an error with my theme and listed the title twice, the Repeat Kit developers were so quick to solve it and make it perfect!"
"I looked for a long time to find an app that was simple and easy to use, but had the options I needed without costing too much. It has a very simple interface which is perfect for people like me who don't understand all the jargon of ecommerce website building. I really enjoy the way it helps move you through setting up the options. It is inexpensive but offers a lot of options, although I wish there was the ability to duplicate product option sections. I also appreciate that it is aesthetically pleasing on the product pages. It has a very simple and clean look that doesn't detract from the products themselves. It does seem to take a while to update on the actual product, however. 
I updated this review on 3/14/20 because I realized what I thought was a glitch was a mistake on my part, so I apologize, and adjusted my rating accordingly."
Recommended to everyone.nice interface. There is no other app like this.and developer are very helpful.just awesome ❤️❤️❤️❤️ .
"We love this App, and the customer service is great!!!
The Live Preview Options offer our customers the opportunity to see personalization and logos superimposed onto the custom item, which provides a better user experience and has helped to increase our conversion rate."
"*****a stellar app at a reasonable price*****
provides an intuitive interface that allows for very individualized color customization from both shop-owner & customer -- from the simple to quite complex (depending upon your photoshop skills).   
the conditional logic feature is an added bonus -- again, easy to set up but with numerous levels of variations.   can also be used for inventory management through setting up warning signs to customers when they select certain parameters.  the app seems to be very responsive to customer input so far, unlike other ones we have sampled.
if you take the time to watch the videos provided, the learning curve is quite quick. developer was graciously helpful in resolving our issues setting up due to us being new to shopify.
for the price, it's hard to beat this app for color customization +.  we haven't tried many apps yet, but we think it's definitely worth it to at least give this one a test drive & see if it works for you."
I'm using it on 2 websites and it works very well. The interface is a bit clunky but that's ok. All the features are there. Thanks!
We downloaded this app for our website's home page & I am so impressed with the app's design capability. We've been able to customise the grid to suit our brand aesthetic perfectly. Very helpful customer service & easy to use interface.
"Great app, loved how easy it was to change the search interface and filters to make it suit our theme. The support team has been very responsive. I had some custom requirements, but the team was amazing at accommodating them. Can definitely recommend Sajari."
I like the cost and interface is easy to use. But please know if you have subscribers in Squarespace then they will not transfer over and customer service will blame you for not doing it right.
We use this app to handle our subscriptions. It has an easy user-interface and super great customer service! Subscriptions are easy to set-up and change if necessary. Still room for improvement - but this is common considering them being a startup. They are willing to support and help with specific tasks and look into developing functions that they don't have yet. All in all a very good app for subscription compared to the rest available.
We use this app to allow our various color options of products to appear within similar products. It does a great job of allowing swatches and the new interface allows for much more customization. Highly recommend.
"Great video maker, easy interface with great effects. I recommend this app for simple yet elegant videos."
"I am trying to create a rewards program for my customers. I have tried a few different options on the shopify app store and I found Gameball to be the best in terms of UI and user experience. Although, the app is not 100% perfect for my needs, the development team and customer support (particularly Habiba) have been responsive and extremely quick to work to resolve any issues I am having. And have been very open to listening to feature requests for things that would improve my experience. A strong part of why I plan to stay using Gameball for my rewards program is their support team. A quick summary of my experience of how the app works. Overall you have players with accounts and you can reward them with points for doing different things such as signing up or placing an order. Customers can trade in their points for things, such as coupons or free products, on your store. And you can also provide your customers different levels to achieve based on points or money spent which unlock specific things you setup for them to cash in their points on."
"Great user interface, best value for money specially when you run a retention based business and very helpful & dedicated support. Habiba (Customer success @ Gameball) and the entire support team are very responsive & supportive when it comes to troubleshooting internal issues regarding app. Big thanks for Gameball for their amazing solution. :)"
"Great app with smooth user experience and pretty flexible to set-up. Best part is the support team, they know what they are talking about and also suggest great ideas!"
Truly fantastic free product - haven looked at the paid plan yet but the interface is remakably easy to use and although text styles are limited there are enough (for now) - great work all
"We added this app and didn't receive another order for 3 1/2 days. When an order finally arrived the customer used the app and then had to write to us to find out where his refund was. It's not listed on the receipt. More time had to be taken to check that his refund was processed. In the meantime, someone wrote to tell us that the app pops up at the beginning of the checkout process in a very intrusive way. Our customers did not appreciate the intrusive nature of the app, saw it and left. Hence our loss of sales. So this app cost us 3 1/2 days of revenue + all the wasted click costs from our PPC program.
Updated 5/19/2015 - I understand that Coopt has updated the app and changed how the interface interacts with the user. Hopefully this eliminates the problem we had with the app. They should be commended for the speed and attention paid to fixing the problem."
"I have been looking around for an affordable and effective rewards for a long time coming, and I am so glad to have found Gameball. I especially love the clean, interactive and fun interface that the app provides. Best thing - customer service! Over the last couple of days while trying to set this up on my store, the team has been so swift and knowledgeable in their replies. I get replies almost instantly via their live chat. Can't wait to launch this on my store and reap the rewards. Kudos to the Gameball team!"
Have recently installed. The Interface is fairly easy to navigate and the support is very good. Heads up: PWA is currently not supported because of support issue at Shopify's end. Hope it gets resolved soon. Overall satisfied. Will try to keep the review updated in case the experience changes. Update: The support has been amazing! The app is working great.
"This app is performing well and with nice and easy interface, also is helping me with the speed of my website."
Found and tested this rewards app after a few tries with others. Definitely one of the best looking and functional app. Many creative ways to reward customers and makes us feel proud to have this running on our interface. Highly recommended!
"Gameball is a very good points rewards app with very nice UI design. Here are its benefits:
1) Great front UI design with attractive icon and interface
2) Nice and simple backend interface to easily understand all settings
3) App integration function which can achieve customer leave review ( I'm using judge.me and get points rewards
4) Nice custom message pop up function to different audience. Hope more function will be added by developer to make this rewards app greater."
"Best Loyalty program in the market. Great interface and great customer service. The app gives you a full range of options and at the same time, you can integrate it into multiple languages. Fully recommend this app!"
"I am using this app to bring a fun experience to my store concept and I cannot thank Gameball enough. The work they are doing is lovely. I love the user interface both frontend and backend. They have also updated their help guides/knowledge base, which is extremely helpful. Besides, they also provide great support. Looking forward to utilizing all their features. Installing is one thing, but understanding how to maximize the power of gamification is equally important. Will update my review soon.
Update 2: 100% recommend using Gameball. Been on it for 2 months now. A bit of a learning curve. But their plans are affordable and functionalities are easy to understand."
"Stop grappling with which rewards app to install and get Gameball! It takes gamification to the next level, with fun challenges, badges and points for customers to earn toward discounts. It still has referrals and all the usual stuff, but lots more. 
Support team is amazingly responsive and happy to jump on a call with you to help build out the program to suit your brand. The interface is super easy to use and understand, and you can build your own challenges from scratch, modify and customise everything to suit your brand.
Can’t recommend them highly enough, and it’s only a matter of time before they become a top contender in the rewards and loyalty space. Fantastic App."
"I was using a 2017 AMP app that was completely obsolete. I tried setting up with superchargify and the interface was really easy to use and some things were already pre-loaded like the Google Analytics tag. I love it so far.
Edit july 2020 :
Based on 6 months of data comparing Mobile Non AMP organic conversion rate vs Mobile AMP organic conversion rate, I noticed that AMP pages had a 1% conversion rate compared to a 2,8% for Non AMP pages. I stoped using AMP from Superchargify because of that. The bounce rate was clearly the cause of it. Bounce rate meaning the experience on the page was not good enough for the customer. There are AMP e-commerce pages that look way better than Superchargify with an actual user experience. I will try those."
"Gameball is my favorite app on Shopify, many things make them the best loyalty app, the ease of the user experience since collecting points to redeeming the coupons, the people behind it are amazing and supportive all the time. KEEP GOING ♥️"
"Extraordinary customer support. We use the app to improve the order experience and speed for our wholesale customers. Thanks to the app, our customers have the possibility to order multiple variants in different colours and sizes in just one step. It's helping us to scale our sales and develop a better user experience. As an addition, it would help if we could switch on/off the ""total"" rows and columns and the layout would collapse them to give the table more space to be set in. Thanks a lot,
Janos from MYMARINI."
"HANDS DOWN some of the BEST customer service that I have ever experienced! Any technical issue that I encountered was resolved immediately and I got the sense that the team at Air Waves really cares about their individual clients! They may not have a huge inventory yet (compared to some of the more established POD's), but the products I have tried so far have all been of excellent quality! Sadly, I can't say the same for all the other POD's I have tried, and it can sometimes be hit or miss. I am hoping for some better interface in the design process and also the sample order placing process of the app, but I know they are working on improving and streamlining the app even as I am typing this! Based on my experience, I have no doubt that this app is only going to continue to get better! Great quality products, and great customer service team. I will be using Air Waves a lot more in the future! Thank you so much Air Waves! Keep up the great work!"
"We started using MySize ID to reduce our return rates on products. Worked like a charm. The ability to define sizing for customers on each of our products past a general size chart is amazing. Allowing the customer to receive a much more accurate measurement for their bodies and giving our customers an overall better user experience has been invaluable. MySize has helped us to lower the amount of return shipments, in turn reducing our carbon footprint! The team at MySize is very helpful and most accommodating through the onboarding process. I would highly recommend."
"Great user support, easy interface, highly recommended. It just would be nice if they had instant updates (in the free version, you have to manually sync your feed whenever you want your website to update your instagram feed. It automatically updates only once a day, and even with the paid plans, it only updates every two or four hours). If they incorporated instantaneous feed updates, this app would be PERFECT."
"Love this app! I wanted to create a magazine for our webshop for years and always struggled to make it look good. Bloggle makes it SO easy to create beautiful posts with an easy drag n drop interface. The SEO elements are very simple to handle as well, so helpful. The team was extra nice and tweaked the app to make it friendly to our (and everyone else who needs) RTL website. Thanks!"
What was missing in Shopify for a while now! Totally changed the game and now we focus our organic marketing efforts easily with Bloggle's user friendly interface.
"I am using this app and love it. EPROLO print on demand app is really easy to use. Simple interface, super fast response time, great product and quality printing. Never had any problems with this app and the customer service team are quick to respond..."
This app helps us and our customers track our orders with an easy-to-use interface. The setup process was quick and any issue we ran into was quickly taken care of by their support.
"As a starter,I choose EPROLO POD to begin with my dropshipping business. I don't know about shipping, quality and delivery, but it has very good reviews. The interface is super easy to use and non demanding on certain sizes. Therefore saving some time since my images are quite large."
"We like Sendinblue for easy and helpful layout, easy contact import and fast support. Some more options in the Newsletter drag and drop layout may be nice but all in all a great user experience."
"Customizable workflows, automation, simple intuitive interface, GDPR compliance. Of course, it takes time to figure this out. But Sendinblue has detailed text help and has video explanations. And if you run into difficulties, the support works well. I have had a positive experience with Sendinblue."
"Just installed this app yesterday, and I can't wait to explore it. Wow, it is really wonderful. After I log in, the interface is really simple, I can easily find what I need, and the customer service is ready to help. Filling the name and e-mail, then I can start the chat, responding is quick."
"EPROLO POD is the best app for print on demand. The quality of the product is exceptional & surpasses competitors. The items are quality, the images represent them with clear precision. Second, the design tool offers unparalleled ease & gorgeous aesthetic user interface."
"Background: We're a b2b company. Our list is subscribers only, no rented or scrapped names. We only email those who open within the last 120 days. Basically, we're not spammers but we do send a lot of email to our contacts. Pros:
- Overall a better than average UX. Easier to use than ActiveCampaign or Hubspot but far less power.
- Easy to use email creation process. Cons:
- You will not believe how militant they are about what email you are sending. I have never experienced anything like it. Their system will without warning stop your campaign if it isn't getting enough opens. They will randomly shut down your entire account without warning if they think you are sending too many emails or possibly unqualified names (yes, they email you after the fact but your account may be shut down for days if you don't keep an eye on your email). If you test a list and it doesn't perform well, your entire account is shut down. If you send too many transactional emails your account is shut down or throttled. When you submit a ticket to ask them to restart your account, it could be a day before you get a response, plus as a bonus you get a lecture - who are you sending email to, where did you get the names on your list, did the agree to receive email from you, what's your website address - over and over again. Recent example: we decided to test SMS marketing and purchased 100 SMS credits for a whopping $1.14. Purchase was put on hold without notice while they sent us a ticket where we were asked questions like, where did you get these names, what information are you going to text them, etc. Extraordinarily frustrating.
- The Shopify plug in doesn't do much without you doing coding - yes you actually have to write code in the app to do certain things. For example, they talk about how you can pull customer buying behavior from Shopify to send emails but good luck figuring that out, you have to do coding. The help files are almost nonexistent on this topic. Their reps couldn't even tell me how to do it.
- Customer support is generally poor. Many reps are not English first language so it is often challenging for English language users to know what the reps are saying. Most reps do not know the system very well so you will go round and round trying to get an answer. Wait times are long. - Looks less expensive at first but they ding you for everything - extra seats, landing pages, transactional emails, etc. - and it adds up fast. Neutral:
- Reporting is good but basic and leaves gaps in your ability to know how your list is performing. For example, want to know if your list is growing or shrinking? You have to manually report on the numbers in different time frames and do some math. How can there not be a report for this most important emailing metric?
- Automations are good but basic. Where are the automation templates for every day activities like DOI, re-engagement, reactivation, etc.?
- CRM is good but basic. That's okay for us but the layout is difficult to use quickly, UX is not great.
- Mediocre email templates. Not a major issue. Creating your own is easy with their drag and drop interface. Overall SendinBlue is a frustrating company to work with and an app that says it will do a lot more than it can actually do. Update: We've been throttled on transaction emails to 5 per hour. Blue states a quota of 100 transactional emails per hour. Technically this is our fault because we imported a new list of names and didn't realize they would all be pushed through DOI. No warning message. For a business with 70,000 contacts this quota is ridiculous."
"My favorite e-mail marketing app! It's one of the easiest to use with a clean, sleek interface. Also offers a nice support system and quick integration with Shopify. The syncing of contacts and data is so easy! Great app and great job, you guys!"
"I am using this app and love it. EPROLO print on demand app is really easy to use. Simple interface, super fast response time, great product and quality printing. Never had any problems with this app and the customer service team are quick to respond to any queries."
"I'm using this app to give e-vouchers to my customers and so far, it has been a seamless experience. The interface in simple and intuitive. Also, the customer service is top notch. I would really recommend this!"
Great app! Such a nice touch to any store and the customer service was so helpful and quick to respond via email to my tech issues. Although the user interface is super easy and simple!
"We joined Easyship about 6 months ago to assist us with managing and improving our international shipping service and we have been very happy so far. The platform interface is relatively easy to use and the customer support is fantastic, from the live chat option through to the care we receive from our account manager, Nikola, who is always looking for ways to support us and improve our overall experience and offering."
"We have been using Easyship for over 6 months and it is by far the best shipping app we have ever used! And trust me, we have worked with over 7 major shipping services now to try and find the right fit for our business! There are many reasons we have finally found our home with Easyship, but first and foremost the user interface is beautiful and functional, and the customer service is amazing! We love the integrated shopping cart with customized carrier options for every customer, the ability to offer shipping insurance, and the focus on international carrier options. In the backend, we love that we can ship in bulk, while easily changing weight or label options for an individual order without leaving the page. It is also incredibly easy to create custom shipping rules, and the filtering options are almost unlimited! Hands down, this is the best shipping app we have ever used! :)"
"After trying many variant option apps, I decided on this one. Not only is the interface extremely user friendly and gives you a preview of what your customization will look like, but the support staff is AMAZING. I wanted to style my text a little differently to line up with my variants and they took care of it quickly! I highly recommend this app."
Very easy to setup & use. Customer support was happy to help. The referral program has alot of options to chose from 7 the interface is easy to navigate
"We have been using their international shipment for 3 months. Overall, the experience is positive. Our initial shipments were for our Indiegogo campaign. They worked with us to use batch shipment to save cost. After that, we are using their regular service for our daily orders. Their UI interface gives you a clear view of shipping cost and duty tax for each available shipping option. Although there are some glitches with the app, they will work with you to fix them quickly. They don't own warehouse, so, all the pick and pack work you will work directly with the 3rd party warehouse that they recommend. Although initially, we were worried about communication issues between 3 parties, it turns out to be a none-issue. We are very happy with the warehouse they recommended. Suggestion for improvement to them is the post-shipment support. You will be getting typical scripted answers many times. But that make you frustrated especially for orders that are stuck or missing. If Easyship wants to be differentiated from their competitors, establishing an effective communication channel with the couriers that they provide can be a game changer. Because that will allow them to provide more info to the clients when a shipment is running into issues during shipment. By the way, have a good relationship with your account manager is important. They have been very helpful in every occasion."
The best Order bump application that I have used! The interface is neat and clean and the customer support is always there to help
We would love to give 6 stars. The interface is the most robust customizable interface out of any fulfillment service we have previously tried. The ShipRelay team also goes above and beyond to troubleshoot any minor issues you might encounter.
"After trying many page builder from different providers, this is the best page builder tool I must say. It is easy to use even for a non-tech guy like me, friendly interface. Highly recommended"
"Nice app that will help you to add any icons to highlight features and gain the trust of customers.
Simple and useful. Reasonable and fair price!
I love how the editor looks, it's easy to preview the current result at the right side and edit settings at the left.
I've contacted several times with Timofey from support, he was very responsive and friendly. I've also compared similar apps, but decided to use this one.
- Guarantees and Features Icons looks fine, but I'm a little bit worried about page views policy. I don't want to play the game ""now change the plan due to the limit of page views"". I want to set up icons once and then do the other things.
- Iconito got a lot of five star reviews in the last time, but the app takes a very long time to load icons, has laggy and untrustworthy interface. It positions itself as ""trust badges"" app, but even doesn't inspire confidence lol.
Although it's free, but I would suggest to think twice before using a free app from unknown developer as you provide the access to some data and abilities anyway. So, I hope my analysis will help someone else to make the right decision, but I can safely recommend this app! :)"
"La promesse est super : une application shopify pour expedier facilement dans le monde entier avec des tarifs jusque -75%. Si vous souhaitez envoyer des colis uniquement en Europe depuis la France c'est une solution OK. Si vous souhaitez envoyer à l'international je ne recommande pas. Les tarifs ne sont pas du tout ""négociés"", ils sont exhorbitants comparé à un simple colissimo avec assurance. La réalité : Envoyer un colis (classique, inférieur à 150cm au total) aux USA depuis la France coute minimum 60 ou 80 euros ! Alors que le tarif colissimo, avec assurance, c'est 30 euros maximum. J'aurai aimé savoir ça avant de m'embêter à tout configurer. Vraiment pas simple à installer, le tutoriel Shopify est difficile à comprendre notamment au niveau de :
- poids et taille des colis, vous devez à chaque fois, pour chaque commande importée, spécifier la taille et le poids (meme si c'est tout le temps le meme)
- synchronisation des commandes, vous devez cliquer sur ""synchroniser les commandes"" à chaque fois sur leur interface (pas de CRON?? :D)
- regles d'expedition, j'ai mis longtemps avant de comprendre que le nom que vous mettiez sur shopify etait ensuite celui utilisé dans l'interface boxtal au niveau des regles d'expedition. Dans tous les cas la règle ne sert a rien si on doit a chaque fois rentrer les dimensions du colis à la main
- aucune possibilité de spécifier plusieurs tailles de colis par défaut
- prelevement SEPA, je l'ai validé via leur support car l'UI etait bloquée sur le dashboard. Depuis le support me dit que c'est validé mais le dashboard est toujours bloqué Enfin, et c'est vraiment dommage, le support client même si il est réactif est vraiment peu compréhensif et donne peu d'espoir quant à des tarifs normaux vers l'international. Au mieux ils confirmeront ce que vous leur dites, au pire ils rateront certaines de vos questions ou bien vous proposent des solutions qui ne peuvent pas vous correspondre."
A great product for those wanting to recommend associated products to customers at checkout.  The user interface is such that makes it easy to use for those of us who are less technical.. Thanks
"Great interface, lots of amazing options even for free users. Will use it with my other websites as well. Highly recommended!"
"I would to mention three points about the app.
01 The interface is without any clutter. Hence elevates the website look.
02 Makes the Post purchase thank you page much useful for Up-selling.
03 Humble request- The referral program included with Points for Purchase would really be a great deal for such a sleek interface."
"Awful user interface and even worse product.  I found a work around (and so did a customer) and they ordered multiple units when it was supposed to be limited to 1.  It was a free + shipping offer so they only paid one shipping price.  
I switched to Order Logic and worked like it should.  No work-arounds like this app."
I tried multiple apps for drop shipping but I experienced yakkyofy app was very user friendly interface and the process cycle time was drastically reduced.
"There are many other fulfillment services but Yakkyofy is much more professional and they have great built-in system that allows several things that is not possible with other fulfillment services, such as the ability to send tracking from US. Very easy to use and I do love that they don't have glitchy system and they have a neat, clean interface. They also offer faster shipping. All in all it's better than most."
"Great app, easy to use interface, GUI is smooth and clean and it works very well. We have needed support twice now and on both occassions have been very accomodating in replying and assisting. Very professional all round customer service and a well functionning app."
"Good interface, and really helpful support! They help me structure my Google Search consul which was a mess due to my theme, for free as part of their support."
I just started using Skio after years of using another subscription platform. The team of Skio is great. They made the onboarding process very easy. Now that Skio is live we have already had customers comment on how much easier the customer interface is to use. Skio's customer service is amazing as well. I e-mailed support and heard back in less than 20 minutes. I'm excited to use and keep learning more about the Skio features.
"If you're reading this, that means you're probably on the fence between which is the best Shopify subscription app for you. Stop researching and install this app now! Having worked with almost every subscription app over the years we were a bit skeptical at first, and the initial cost was a bit more expensive than what we were currently using, ReCharge. Here are just a few reasons why Skio so much better than ReCharge: 1. Customer login is a breeze, and ACTUALLY works. When we were on ReCharge we would get daily support tickets from customers saying they couldn't login. This would then force us to walk them through an ""account reset"". Not only is it confusing for the customer, but frankly it made us look like we had no idea what we were doing as a company. This got so bad and frustrating for customers that we lost multiple members because they were consistently annoyed with not being able to login and just decided to cancel all together. 2. The user interface is so simple that you don't need to spend days developing training content and FAQs for your customers. Within HOURS of us rolling out Skio we received multiple emails from customers saying how they loved the new customer portal and how intuitive it is. I think anyone would agree that those are the customer inquiries you want to receive. 3. Their support team is on it. Yes, they are a smaller company, so hopefully this level of service maintains with growth, but so far it has been amazing. 4. The migration was painless and their team helped us through everything. Just a few exports from ReCharge and we were ready to go. The one downside that we've seen so far is they don't support gift cards that well. We're told this is a limit with the Shopify side so there's not much they can do at this point, which makes sense. We've implemented a work around for the time being, and hopefully future updates to the platform and Shopify in general will better support gift cards. At the end of the day, we are extremely happy with Skio and are excited to see what they do with the platform to continue expanding functionality and integrations. Keep it up Team Skio!"
Choosing Skio as our subscription platform has been one of our best business decisions this year. We've seen a significant decline in subscription churn and customer reach outs around issues with their sub. The user experience is unparalleled and the support team has been engaged and thoughtful every step of the way. All of this has made me confident in our team's decision to choose Skio as the #1 subscription provider to support our hyper-growth and scale in the coming years.
Easy to use and we received incredible support from Kennan and his team. Seamless implementation and great user experience
"Skio fixes all the problems we were having with that other subscription partner. Its seamless interface is so easy to use, which allows us to provide the best subscription experience to our customers. The team is awesome and I'd recommend Skio to companies looking to make the switch or adding subscription to their sites for the first time."
Subscriptions are a big deal and we evaluated a lot of different subscription management apps - Skio brought the most to the table. Kennan and Liam are very responsive and easy to work with. Skio has a nice interface for customers and we are very happy that we made the switch - recommend very highly
"Out of the box Skio works well for single variant products, but for multi-variant products which are at different price points you might need a developer to help get this app working to how you want it. I did have some issues with getting this up and running as support is limited but now that it's in place it's working well and I appreciate the flexibility of being able to tweak the liquid ourselves to get the ideal user experience."
"Exactly what I was after. Easy to use, the interface is perfect, and the styling options are great.
Only Suggestion: you should enable more icon selections as default from other categories. As an example, if I wanted to create a 'link' icon, I should be able to select from the default icons, the custom upload icon, or icons from other categories.
If I wanted to create a custom link icon for a quote page or a custom page, I might want to use the email icon, instead of having to upload a custom one."
I just installed this app for my new store and it is so easy and seamlessly presented that I feel confident in it already. Amazing user experience so far!
"It is the only booking appointment that has great interface, easy to use, functional. The support team is ultra responsive, they managed to change whatever I needed the first day and I was still on trial. Thank you so much. Since we launched this automated booking service, our sales have increased exponentially. Great purchase. Thank you so much, keep it up!"
"This interface is really good, choosed the 9$ plan and could do everything I wanted and it looked super professional Singhal, the owner also helped me so much when I needed help or when I wanted really specific things, very helpful and friendly. Thanks a lot for everything I really recommend you to use appointly"
Very easy to use interface. Customer support is great and responds quickly to all queries. Had some doubts which were answered efficient
"Use Variant Option Product Options by Best instead!
This app, by Relentless Apps, was the first one to do Image Swatches that I came across when I was first opening my shop, and I wish I never had added it. When I first got it, it was free, and I could use the Image Swatches for free as well, but eventually they decided to bump up their price to take advantage of fools like me who didn't have time to search for another app.
The interface is infuriating and difficult to use, it's very counter-intuitive, has almost no visuals at all, at least, it didn't up until the moment I uninstalled it on March 28, 2022. You have to scroll through huge columns of text, you cannot search for your items by collection or tag, the only way to do anything in the app is to know the exact names of your items. The ""Duplicate"" option is phrased in a confusing way, so you can't tell if you're selecting the item you wish to copy or the item you wish to copy TO, it doesn't always work, and you can barely tell if it's done anything or not. You have to search for the item AGAIN, by its full title, to then click on it, and see if the change was made.
I was able to accept all of these flaws because it was free. But for the last many months, without my really knowing, this app was costing me nearly $10 a month! Horrifying!
The other odd thing I noticed was the name would change every now and then, which I found strange, but didn't think anything of it. Now that I see it has the same name as another app, which has all of the same features FOR FREE, and guaranteed to always be free. My guess is that they changed the name, probably multiple times, to try to match this other app, to trick more hapless fools like me into getting it, and then charging them nearly $10 a month for an app that barely functions. tldr: Get the app by Best of the same name. You won't be disappointed."
"As default the app is quick and easy to integrate with the shopify shop. And prices are in the good end also. Interface is smooth, which is really nice. If you need assistance from the vendor, they are quick at responding and answers your questions or helps solve a challenge. So i do have a great way to offer my clients a booking system which makes it very easy for me to administrate."
"So far so good. Easy installation, prompt and helpful support, and good interface. I'll add another review after using it awhile, but I'm pleasantly surprised at the easy set-up!"
We've been using Bodegacat to pick and pack our online orders and we absolutely love it. It's helped us make sure that we never sell an item on the floor that's already sold online. It's friendly user interface and integration into Shopify POS means that our team was able to start using it right away. It's very simple to get started and we got to reclaim our white board that was keeping track of what orders to get. The Bodegacat team is also fantastic and added features that we requested the next day!
"Unfortunately I couldn't get it to work. I was testing with one product but then the app changes the interface for ALL products. Tried going back to default setting with no success other than deleting the app itself. Customer support sent me a bunch of links to help pages, which made it even more confusing to pinpoint the problem."
I Installed a lot of Booking apps on Shopify wich are kind of overprized for my costumers need and i have to say appointly helped us a lot. It is very flexible and the widget costumization is the only one i have seen wich offers you to rewrite the text featured in the widget. Also it was amazing to be able to set up different employees and thier availability. I Used the Option to create different type of services (Kids & Adults) with different availability in the same Product. The user interface is easy and looks very very professional. The support was awesome and they are open to add new features if you have a idea. Just amazing:D i think this Plugin has the potential to be one of the most used booking plugins
"This app is great, especially for the price. Others serving this function are surprisingly expensive, but this one offers much more bang for your buck and is pretty quick to set up. Their support responds extremely quickly and is patient and happy to help, which is a huge game changer, especially in this world. 
The app is easy enough to use, but the interface could be more user friendly. Navigating isn't very intuitive when setting up, but it's easy enough to figure out if you're fluent in Internet. I know this is a pretty new app from this team, so the finer details will be smoothed out in time. I look forward to future releases that add in more admin tools + clean up the UI/UX a bit.
We tried to use a different free app for our waitlists first, but couldn't get the button to appear without refreshing. I had the same issue with this one, but eventually figured out that it was because I had a setting in my theme enabling 'quick shop' which triggers a popup instead of the actual product page. Took me about a week to figure out, tried all sorts of coded solutions to no avail, only to find that setting buried so just wanted to mention in case anyone else is experiencing the same thing. Caused quite a headache.
Great work guys, thanks for being awesome!"
I have multiple warehouses and multiple shipping carriers.  Also feed multiple stores into the interface.  Makes shipping easy and sends tracking numbers back into all my stores across shopify and ebay.  Very nice application.
"My use case is needing to generate monthly invoices for accounting, one per page. I was super happy about Order Printer's promise to solve it. Unfortunately it has a major caveat, as it's limited to 50 orders per ""bulk"". We are not a huge shop, but we have over 100 orders every month. When I select the amount we need, it doesn't work AND doesn't report an error. Instead shows something like 7(?) orders without the PDFs(?) - a result that makes no sense at all. As a software developer myself, I don't understand why this limit. I get that there needs to be one, but it should be significantly higher. PDFs with more than 50 pages typically don't break modern computers. I think the previous screen, where you select orders, already does the job of selecting as many orders as the user wants, so this really seems like something that could be achieved by adding a ""0"" to ""limit=50"" in the code - although I can ofc also imagine things being different. Summarised:
- limit should be significantly higher
- if it's more than the limit, the interface should inform the user that something is wrong
- if there's a limit, it should be documented in FAQ or somewhere
- it should not advertise ""bulk print"" with a limit as low as 50 hope this doesn't sound to angry :) I understand there there is not always the time to do everything. Hopefully this can be expedited, given how easy it (seemingly) is. I also heard from support that this issue was also reported by other users."
Helped so much. Simple to use with a great interface. Great support and easily worth the money! Highly recommend.
"The app is simple to run, has a great user interface and allows you to set up more complex promos which other apps aren't able to do (the big one for us was a tiered spend and save that allowed you to set your own triggers and discount types!) Gavyn from the support team was very helpful in setting up and ironing out any issues - we did have a slight issue with the mobile checkout button not working at first but it was fixed probably within an hour of chatting to support. If you need help setting up the cart integrations/custom code (we did) definitely contact them as they are 10/10. Will be using for any and all future promos!"
Extremely satisfied with the app performance and the customer support team. There is nothing they couldn't do to help me optimize the user experience. Sammy and David are absolutely dedicated to their customers and are on the road for a big success. They solved a big issue Shopify is putting to its customers and they are doing it with a brilliant professionalism and efficiency. Thank you again for everything!!!
"Decent idea. Horrible execution.  If I could give it -5 stars I would.  
This is ""simple UI, happy path"" shipping software.  Which would be great except it doesn't work.  You're paying for software that intentionally doesn't have the bells and whistles that shipstation has, an easy interface.  The kind of interface that is easy to turn into a mobile app, or navigate on an iphone.  However, the decision to write the software using javascript modals means it is completely broken on mobile.  So much for happy path.
The decision to make this a javascript browser side app also means that search is painfully slow after you have more than around 500 orders.  
Syncing with your shopify store is problematic at best.  Orders that are cancelled in shopify sometimes actually cancel in ordoro, other times they don't. Meaning you have to enter the cancellations twice or risk sending out product that wasn't paid for.
There is no mechanism to bulk edit the insurance amount, anymore.  We sell some items at $105.  We have to go through and print the labels on each of them individually or pay an extra $3 per shipment.  The kicker here is they actually had this feature and it was working, but they decided to remove it.  The removal actually created a horrible bug where every order got insured for the last insurance amount you manually entered.  This bug was active on the site for about two months.  Are they even testing this software?
And, while we're talking about insurance.  They have the scummiest feature of defaulting you to their insurance provider, no matter how many times you select ""carrier insurance.""  
No role based access to information -- we're an open company, but there's a limit to which I want my 3rd party fulfillment center to know my full sales data.
In the end we had to go back to buying every label individually.
And finally, once we decided to switch to a more full featured software package (shipstation), they locked our account as we were over the free limit -- never mind that we'd paid for the full month already and had merely opted to not renew.  Yet another simple use case they didn't write the software to handle.  
Overall, once you're bigger than their free tier you're better off using shipstation.  If you try to use it after that point, you're just accruing technical debt that will come back to bite you eventually.    
Go with shipstation.  Same price, but actually usable."
Out of the shipping an inventory management Ordoro is by far the best! Great simple clean interface and low prices!
"The software and user-friendly interface is perfect for my business! all my orders get sent to Ordoro quickly and the shipping is way too easy! What I love most about Ordoro is their customer service. If I call, someone picks up immediately, If I send an email, someone responds within minutes! The pricing plan is extremely reasonable compared to others out there. Well played, Ordoro. Well played."
"I don't know where to start with these guys but I promise you, this is the app you have been searching for and could never find! The team behind this previously developed a discount engine for a very large company/brand that we all know and love. I probably can't say who it was on here but if you ask them, I'm sure they'll tell you. However, once I heard what their background was, I was quite sure this app would be nothing but the best - something you don't see often with Shopify. This app actually allows you to use multiple discounts (manual or automatic) together, not only this, they are applied clearly and cleanly on the cart page for customers to see... and it does this in a straightforward way, unlike most other apps which completely take over your cart page/checkout and cause other problems! So not only do we have an app here that works, but it's also the most stable I have come across (and I have installed and tested pretty much every discount app available). The interface is extremely easy to use and setup, you may need some help with implementing the code for the discounts and subtotal to display on the cart page, but the support team is just as good as the app. They'll quickly help you and take care of this for you as well as any formatting to match your theme if required. The only limitation TEMPORARILY is more settings on manual discount codes (customer eligibility etc.) but this will all come in good time as they are working on this. Within the next 3-6 months, I can see this app taking over the Shopify built-in discount solution, with all of Shopify's features/settings as well as more to offer. This app is a prime example of how others should follow. I cannot believe it has taken this long for someone to offer a stable solution for such a simple task. Thank you Sammy for all of your help and answering my questions - especially on a Sunday!"
Stackable provided us with the perfect solution when trying to offer our customers multiple discounts consolidated the way we wanted. Also lovely interface and great support!
"Ordoro is breath of fresh air that really stands out from the available shipping/order management apps. If you like the clean, well thought out Shopify interface you'll love how Ordoro pushes the bar still further. It's very clutter-free and intuitive. There is no such thing as once size fits all when it comes to business software, one app can not be all things to all people, but after working with Ordoro I feel like they've made excellent decisions about what features to include and they've done a beautiful job executing, both functionally and aesthetically. Features lists and screen shots are great, and they do an excellent job of giving you a peek inside their app on their site but to make a decision you have to import your orders and really see what it's like to use the software. You can tell that the Ordoro team is passionate about what they do, it really shows in their app. Speaking of the team I've been very impressed with their support on the few occasions I have needed contacted them. I wish all software was as easy to use. 
It's a breeze to import orders from all your marketplaces (the shopify integration couldn't be more fluid) you can be up and running the same day. I was also really pleased to see they are integrated with GroovePacker, which is fantastic if you have a number of SKU's and would like to eliminate shipping errors. Another thing I really like about Ordoro is the integrated help. It's nice not to have to leave and go hunting through out-of-date support pages to get answers. I really feel like Ordoro has my back!"
"This app does what no others do that I have found. I have been trying multiple bundle and discount apps for a few months now. Some I don't like because of the way they use variants or draft orders. Some use too much code that interferes with other apps. Some can't reliably handle updating the discount with multiple hits of the back button or update cart button. This one works super well and has a sleek interface that ""game-ifies"" the shopping experience but not in an obtrusive way. David and his team also have great support and are mindful to leave ones store with clean code. My average order value is WAY up over my other bundle app already (which has been uninstalled). Cheers!"
"The interface is simple and easy to use.  Something for a person with zero experience can learn with ease!  Not to mention the support so far has been great.  Sometimes simple is better, but still get all the things you need to help run a business."
"Update: After using the service for 6 years I can tell you that this is by far the best shipping solution we have found for Shopify. The workflow is simple and intuitive, the user interface is seamless and neat, and the customer service is absolutely wonderful.  I don't think we've ever had a major issue with the program, but the Ordoro team was always helpful giving us a rundown of changes after any program updates. We strongly recommend getting an Ordoro Pro account for any business with medium to heavy shipping traffic as the dropshipping and kitting options are great for large inventories. Give Ordoro a shot!!!
This is a great app.  It's intuitive and works seamlessly with Shopify.  The biggest plus for our company is the stellar customer support.  We get help instantaneously; real help, not some bored programmer, but people with their synapses firing who are patient and willing address problems and train our staff.
You want your shipping program to keep inventory and talk to your shopping cart ... so the marriage between the two has to be squabble free.  Shopify and Ordoro make a great couple!"
Lots of products to choose from and the design interface is easy to use once you learn how it works. Would love to see the update on the website.
"Far too difficult to design. The Silverlight extension is unsupported by most browsers these days and trying to design within the Shopify interface is just farcical. I can only assume those behind this site have never actually done what they expect others to do. If you're from DropShipCN and reading this, just try designing, say, the hi-top skate sneakers from with Shopify. You can't even change colours without loading up that colour as an image. Enlarging something to fit the full canvas means the handles disappear behind the Shopify console, etc. I use Printful, Subliminator, InterestPrint, KinCustom etc and by comparison this is shockingly bad. I can't comment on the products themselves because I haven't put my designs on any! The app goes off my store right after I hit the 'submit review' button here."
"I place an order for a sample o 4/7 and never received it, another other for a customer on 4/12 looks like this may make it to my customer by 5/12. Had to refund this order to save a customer, I would be scared to use this app in the future. Sucks because the interface was by far my favorite."
"It's OK, but very tricky to get working correctly. The various appearance options to promote the special offer are confusing and usually don't work well without a lot of trial and error. (we have never got the banner to appear in product images). The pop-up appearing in the checkout is so slow, that most customers click on before it even appears. It has potential but seems buggy and the user interface is poorly thought out and confusing. Support is also slow and responses are normally next day if you are lucky."
"During the process of building a site for a Fortune 500 company, we studied 30+ apps related to promotion campaign management. Our ideal app should support the following patterns of promotion campaign. (1) buy A with discount type.
(2) buy A and B with discount type.
(3) buy quantity A with discount type.
(4) buy A over amount with discount type.
(5) buy A, get C with discount type.
(6) buy A, get C with discount type in next purchase. Ultimate Special Offers came out at the top of the list for several reasons. (a) User interface compatible in style with Shopify native user interface.
(b) Able to support most of our target campaign management patterns.
(c) Speedy support from the team led by Rob. The support team helped to identify incompatibility with another app and rectify the situation to allow us to proceed with the testing of USO. All in all, it has been a pleasant experience working with the USO team."
Customer Support is excellent. I had a few issues setting everything up but they replied quickly and with screenshots to show me exactly what to do to get the offers working how I wanted. Any bugs found were sent to a developer and fixed as well. Amazing service. App interface is easy to use and customizeable. I currently use a bundle offer with a gift (shown to help advertise XX amount till you get free shipping).
"The simplicity of the initial setup, the simplicity of the menu, and the speed with which new users are able to grasp what they need to do to accomplish their tasks caused me to take a closer look at this software and I'm glad I took the time to do so. I am really impressed with their minimalistic user interface over anything. One of the biggest pros though is that they are continually updating the program and improving the use and functionality of the software. They're also very easy to communicate with and give feedback to if you can possibly think of an additional feature. It's completely affordable when compared to other apps in the market.
As a start, I registered with the Lifetimefree plan, but after a while, I decided to try the basic plan which turns out to have various additional functions just right for my business. I especially want to mention that, workflows are a very handy feature along with many other useful features.
As I experienced, they have a trial month in this upgraded plan. After my trial month, I decided to continue with this software, because my team had a seamless transition to MyLogiwa.
Fully recommended"
Super quick and great support! Fixed my issue in no time. Easy interface and easy uploading. I will definitely recommend this app!
Confusing to set up and get going! But I'm sure it works just fine. Just not a very friendly user interface.
"Très satisfait de l'application ! Pratique, ludique, efficace. Encore des améliorations possibles sur l'interface pour qu'elle soit encore + intuitive et logique mais très bonne app."
"When we sought out to have more clarified product recommendations I looked through at least 10-15 apps and researched them very intensely. For our specific needs, Recomatic was the one I kept returning to. The setup and interface are a little bit different than some others but the app works like a charm. Their algorithm seems to be smarter than most without even having to tag all your products. And their customer support is top notch. Very easy to communicate with via email, which can be a really hard feat, they also answer very quickly, and they've made some tweaks to our version to fit our needs. Very much recommended. They've bumped sales very easily. Thanks Recomatic crew!"
"The process right from download was so straightforward. Integration is superb, providing a great user experience for vendors and customers alike. Highly recommend."
"I love your T-shirt products and you have brands that I could not find somewhere else from UK suppliers . However the experience with your app and website really drives me nut and is killing my patience. It is extremely slow and more often than not it just does not work at all, I kept clicking clicking and the site/app just remained as is.  Creating a few products on here took me the whole day as the website just did not work properly. When I exported products to shopify, nothing came up on my Shopify. Note: this is not to do with my internet connection as everything else was working perfectly. In short, I really struggle to get things done with your app and website.
I still have a little bit of patience here and will keep going but I guess I might decide to go back to Printify soon as the app user experience is effortless there."
"Really warm, friendly service with a sleek chat interface. They have only gotten better with time, and I have every confidence this will continue. Their environmental policy and ethics seem to be unparalleled among print-on-demand services on Shopify. They carry quality cotton products that I can't find anywhere else. While product creation can be slow and there are sometimes print issues, this doesn't seem that different from anywhere else. Products with print mishaps go to charity rather than to waste. Recommended."
"I have only just started using this app, but already I can tell it's going to be perfect for creating gorgeous looking blog posts. There are many many options to get your post looking exactly the way you want it to look, which like any new software will take some time learning. Already I have reached out to ShopPad's support team, and they are very quick in replying. Why not 5 stars? The user interface to get to all those options might not be the most intuitive - but will be something that hopefully will become second nature the more I use it."
"Great integration, user friendly interface and very easy to manage my customer data. I didn't need to consult my developer to view personas and segments in my data. Very pleased with the overall functionality of this app and would highly recommend it. Thank you!"
"Wholesale - All In One is an excellent app for wholesale. It is obvious that it is important to them that you are pleased with the app and that it is working well on your site.  The interface is beautiful and professional. The shipping is pretty comprehensive and integrated, and to my understanding also works with Shopify's calculated shipping.  
It would be beneficial for them to do a line sheet for easier reordering for customers, then it would have it all. And, it does take them a few days to get things installed (they must be busy).  But, they were very communicative and responsive with me."
"The interface for editing the posts is a little bit clunky (it's easy to add erroneous blocks and spaces), but it is miles better than the native blog posts that Shopify offers. Support is incredibly quick and courteous, I would highly recommend giving this app a try if content marketing is an important strategy for your shop's traffic. I can't say enough positive things about being able to finally redirect blog visitors to my products inside of a post and the ability to add a table of contents for easier reading."
"I use this app for wholesale pricing. It works very well with choosing pricing at customer level (using tags or login) and at product level. The interface is user friendly and it is very efficient. What I liked even more, was the availability of developers to customize the features. The support team is very responsive and very helpful. They even came back with better solutions than the ones we asked for. I would definitely recommend them."
"Not sure what app the other reviewers were using (my guess is they are fake). This is terrible, just a listing of stores and over complex interface."
It's a very helpful app for dropshipping automation it's simple and easy to use interface with one-click import products.
"This really helped our blog look better. The user interface sometimes is a little quirky, but we got quick support to help us figure things out."
Works as expected.  Would be nice to have an easier interface to change the size of the thumbnail and color of the text rather than doing it through code.
"While Carro is new, the functionality it provides is unlike any other platform out right now. The team is constantly working on improving the user experience and is extremely good at taking criticism. In addition, the support team makes it extremely easy to set up a marketplace just the way you want it. Their lightning-quick response times and dedication to answering any questions make using Carro a no-brainer."
"Great support and suggestions that really work! The interface of the App is clear and convenient, I would recommend it to everyone."
Excellent software. Has saved us hundreds of hours so far and the user interface is amazing. Really a life saver. I would recommend this to any Shopify store looking to automate their customer service.
We've started using this app about a month ago and we can highly recommend it. Although there is still some work to be done on the side of design and user interface. The level of involved and flexibility from the support team is wonderful. They’ve helped us out very quickly with custom translation and other requests.
"The Courses app itself is elegant, streamlined and easy to use. Much better than the alternatives out there.  I am a total novice and I was able to understand the interface. It's the customer support this company gives its customers that puts them over the edge. They definitely go above and beyond to make a great experience. I'll be a Courses user for life and would recommend to anyone with no hesitation!"
It's really easy to use and it's possible to edit the entire interface of the popup. I'm really impressed it's for free. I hope they don't start charging anytime soon.
"Autoketing's apps have a clean interface, easy to use and I'm grateful that these apps exist. Although the apps now work splendidly, I wish there was an all-in-one app for even easier navigation."
"Pledger is a brilliant app. The set up is straightforward, the user interface is great for customers and the Pledger support team are great to deal with and were able to set up our chosen charity for us really quickly. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Pledger to other businesses."
Great app with an interface & design that makes it very easy to use. Easy to tailor the front-end to match your website design together with other preferences. Great analytics and synonyms features. Very helpful & responsive support as well!
"This was my first use of an affiliate marketing app, and it has been a great experience!  It has a clean and easy to use interface, customer support answered my questions within an hour, and best of all my affiliates have been really impressed with the system!  
I do wish there were some integrations for this system with quickbooks or some other bookkeeping service so that I could issue payments and record them automatically.  But I am just recording and issuing the payments manually for now, and given all of the other features that work so seamlessly, this isn't a really that big of a deal.  If you're thinking about any type of affiliate marketing, use this app."
"Absolutely amazing app, the interface & design looks great & is easy to use. Makes my customers job a lot easier to search & find the product that they need. Very helpful & responsive support as well! One of the best apps out there."
"This search app has a very easy and comfortable interface, immediate ROI improvement, overall a great purchase."
"I sincerely cannot say enough to express how much I love this app. Before ShoutOut, I was using a VERY expensive, clunky, glitchy and unattractive program - it gave Ambassadors ""points"" when they engage on social media. Those points were then converted into huge discounts on my site. I learned through that year of beta testing that people who love the brand are going to post regardless if they get points or not --- and giving points/discounts for every post was unsustainably eating into my margin. There is virtually zero ROI nowadays when people post/tag in the current social climate because most post go unseen. The algorithm is not our friend. So I decided to kill that program and look elsewhere. 
First, I downloaded Refersion because it is an ""industry leader"" and ""all of my friends were doing it"" ... After about 10 days of their free trial, I became SO frustrated by how ugly and hard-to-use their interface was. Features were hidden in weird places and when I reached out to support, I felt like I was always getting a sharp/annoyed response. I got the impression that I was more of a burden than a potential long-term partner. Plus, they wanted to charge me $150 an hour to change some weird/default verbiage that was off-brand. It should not cost $150 to change one customer-facing sentence. Luckily, I found ShoutOut before my free trial with Refersion was over and I am SOOOO Glad I did!!!
ShoutOut is probably my favorite Shopify App I have ever installed. It is SO easy to use, it's clean/gorgeous and incredibly intuitive. Whenever I have had an issue/question with setup, Adam has responded quickly/thoroughly and without an ounce of grumpiness. The program is perfect out-of-the-box and I love that I was able to ""turn off"" the SignUp option so now we are able to curate the perfect application process and keep it 100% on-brand. We have been using it for about a month now and all my Ambassadors who have migrated from the old program love it. So far, there have been zero issues from Ambassadors complaining that they didn't get an earned commission (that happened a lot with the old program)  and i LOVE LOVE LOVE that ShoutOut gives you the ability to create a custom URL. My old program wanted over $150 a month to add that feature!!! (ummmm, no.)
In all, I can't recommend ShoutOut enough. Give Adam a shot and you won't regret it! =)"
"It does what it says it'll do, for the most part. If you have multiple scrolling messages it'll push the rest of the site down by as many messages, which can mess up your layout.
The interface for changing the messages looks like a 90s era website, there's junk everywhere and it's hard to find the button you need.
Why the 1 star? Without warning and as far as I can tell without stating it anywhere, they started pushing notifications to my customers (and myself) through my site asking people to leave a review to be eligible for some gift card that they're supposedly giving out. This is an unforgivable breach of trust, and an instant and permanent uninstall of all their products in my book."
"I literally downloaded EVERY SINGLE announcement bar app that I could find. I was looking for one that allowed me to have a ""sliding"" announcement bar with 2 different promotions. This is the ONLY one I could find that was free. Paying $10/mo is ridiculous for an announcement bar!!
This app is easy to use, the interface looks a bit messy and crowded, but don't let that fool you. Tons of options and really does the job!
Thanks for keeping the app free!"
"Probably the best shipping app on Shopify, I've tried about 4, including this app. I was looking for better shipping rates and this app offers the best service by far.
Integration
Shopify, Amazon, eBay, Etsy, Opencart, OSCommerce, Prestashop, Magento, PayPal, Volusion, BigCommerce and a few more. So you can import all your orders automatically from several different channels
Goshippo integrates with ebay and shopify, but I did not check others
Netparcel only integrates with Shopify
Shipping Easy I didn't check for integration with other platforms
Fees 
XPS - no monthly or additonal fees - to pay you need to add funds
Shippo - no monthly fees, label cost plus 5c
Netparcel - no monthly fees - bills your card manual or automatically
Shipping Easy - free if you post less than 50 per month, thereafter sliding scale monthly fees
Rates - USPS
Best rates I have found for USPS, cheaper than Shippo, Shipping Easy and, if I'm not mistaken, Shopify. Note I mainly use flat rate boxes
Rates - Couriers - FedEx, UPS
If you have a FedEx or UPS account, like we have, you can compare to XPS, XPS got us much better rates, on some packages we save up to $9! NOTE - You might find that you may get better discounts with your existing accounts depending on the discounts you have.
Although XPS are not the cheapest, Netparcel was cheaper, but by small margins $1 - $3 plus/minus. I did mention this to XPS and they said they will work on cheaper. However, if you add additional insurance then you find that rates are the same or differ by a few cents, either way. XPS does have a much better UI and they will get you rates with USPS and UPS. 
Netparcel only does FedEx.
Unfortunately, Goshippo will only integrate with your existing accounts, they won't be able to get you cheaper than what you already pay.
I think Shipping Easy also integrates with your exisiting FedEx account, but to get a cheaper rate we needed to contact my FedEx account rep to see if our discounts are more or less than Shipping Easy, he was supposed to get back to us and we didn't follow up, too much headache.
User Interface
I think better than all. You add sender, receiver, package type, dimensions, weights and select courier service type all on same page, and get the quote in real time, no moving between 2-3 pages. You get competing rates from 3 service providers, USPS, FedEx and UPS (Goshippo does do this but you have to go through a couple of pages and they won't be cheaper)
Live customer service, just call the number to speak to someone. 
You can also handle claims on XPS but I have not tried this feature yet.
I will edit this review if needed"
"We have just started using the Referral Candy app but in addition to a wonderful user experience, we had to reach out to the CX team for some support with our Klayvio integration (*our fault, not theirs), and Erbin from their team was awesome to work with. He took the time to listen to our issue, walk us through the troubleshooting and provided a timely resolution that exceeded our expectations. Can't recommend the app and their service team enough."
"Their interface is easy to use. Most of my feed loaded properly but when there was an issue, I got great help by calling them."
"We were looking for an upsell app that targets individual products in the cart instead of the whole cart, and this fits our needs almost perfectly! For a small app, the interface is also pretty well done. The developers are also responsive to support and open to suggestions for improvements."
"This app is a must-have in your up-sell/cross-sell app collection. It took me 5 minutes to get started and less than a day to start seeing results!
For merchants and customers the user experience is flawless and very intuitive. The feature that I like the most, is it's customisable design and the just enough presence in the checkout process to nudge the client into adding a new product.
Great work!"
"User interface is very good. Easy to use and understand. App downtime issues are there at times, hope they fix it for good."
A very simple to use interface and easy seo rating process to let you know how well the seo on a given page is.
"easy to use, great interface but no way to know or prove over time that the recommendations made by ReloadSEO actually make any difference."
"Brilliant app - whilst I don't go crazy for the user interface, it does the job perfectly and what I love the most is the support!! Honestly, I get responses to queries within a couple of hours (if not less) and Adam from the support team is just so happy to help and super efficient... Makes a huge difference as I've had to delete some apps due to customer support being so bad! Really love it and highly recommend for anyone who has multiple variants in their store (associated with only a few products) as it's a brilliant way to bulk out your store if you only have a few products - e.g. I run a swimwear business and only sell 13 styles - but they all come in 11 colours. This allows me to show all colours on the collection page. Thank you!"
"The app is great! The interface of the app might not be so pretty, but it does the job. Customer support is quick to reply to any questions and more importantly: providing solutions!"
"Fuel is by far the best, most rocking app for POD business. Such a simple though elegant user experience. Totally sold on it."
"Worst interface I have ever seen on Shopify app store. 
Decent functionality, but would rather use Variable Products by ZubrCommerce. ‍♂️"
Amazing interface and great design features. Very easy to use. Items are also good quality and shipping is fast. Highly recommend Fuel POD app to everyone.
"Innovative user interface, ease of navigation, amazing price savings, great quality products, prompt customer support and quick order fulfillment. What more could you ask for?"
"Easy to use interface, great product options, amazing mockups. I am very happy with Fuel. I really hope they launch apps for popups, size charts and online chat so we have all the solutions under one roof."
"Great personalization options, easy to use interface and very innovative features, not to mention unbelievable price savings on most items. Love it!"
High quality products and great shopify store integration with easy to use interface. I am hoping to work with Fuel to grow my online business.
Using Fuel for quite a while and very happy with the interface and product options. Their prices are also very good. I have installed Fuel on all my stores and keep recommending them to everyone.
"Amazing prices, totally unbelievable! User friendly interface, easy integration and wide range of products. I have used quite a few other apps but I think I am going to use this one on all of my websites, provided their customer support is just as good."
"We used WalktheChat's WeChat store in order to create the online sales channel for our brand in Mainland China. The solution enabled us to make our products available to the Chinese market with minimal upfront investment. The support for WeChat Mini-programs improved the user experience for our end-users, and the synchronization with Shopify is smooth."
"Update (4/1/2022): Fuel used to be fantastic for its price offerings, but today prices rose as much as 30% on some items. As someone who buys blanks for a living by units in the thousands, I know the rates they can get them for. Super unfortunate that we will be taking our business elsewhere now for majority of our items.
Update (1/8/2022): I want to to love this POD vendor so badly since there rates and interface are good, but it seems like every month theres a new issue. Lately they have been sending emails to our already massively jammed email inbox when something is out of stock, and they only give you two days to respond. They used to just put it in the ""error"" category and it was so much easier, we would swap it for a new garment on our own. Instead, we miss some of the emails, don't realize orders are cancelled, and then customers are mad they have to reorder (and we had no idea for weeks). Also - they are way behind the ball compared to other POD vendors when it comes to adding more variety. For instance, they only have 2 ""low tier"" hoodie options, when for most sellers those are the most profitable items. I have asked for over a year for them to offer a mid tier/top tier hoodie blank. Also - don't even thick about doing hats or beanies with them - they take weeks to produce and by the time they get to production, the color is 9/10 times out of stock. We just today switched to a new vendor for hats and beanies because this was a daily issue.
Update (12/9/2021): Quality seems to have improved, have had under a .5% return request rate over the past few months. My only complaint still is the major out of stock problems we face with items like hats, select colors of blanks, etc. Lastly, and most importantly, they have a very limited selection compared to every other POD vendor. They only offer 2 hoodie blanks... like come on there are hundreds of blanks out there that could easily be stock, especially a ""better quality"" one compared to Gildan. We still have to use other vendors to get those nice hoodie items, and therefore charge our customers who buy multiple items for shipping twice since it cannot all be done on FUEL.
Update (6/19/2021): Quality is not good, had an issue last week and this week. Made a 13 item order, and 8 of them are faulty. Not sure how 8 faulty items are able to sneak by quality control, that must not even exist. Print on them is off centered, front and back, as well as sizing wrong on many of the items. Should not have to worry that my clients are going to make a big order and half of it be faulty. Get what you pay for, now looking for new POD vendor.
Update (6/16/2021): Finally, things are mostly back to normal. Shipping is back to normal speeds, MOST items ship within 7 days. Sometimes faster. They did just raise shipping prices which is unfortunate but its the way of the world. Going to keep my rating at 4 stars permanently until they expand their product offering in the categories that matter to the influencer business such as sweatpants and shorts. Also, limited products in the hoodie section (top sellers for influencers). Wish they had a garment like Independent Trading Co or another midweight hoodie, the blanks are only a few dollars more wholesale. A lot of their competition offers it and sadly we have to use them for those products, and therefore have to charge our customers for shipping twice, damaging the customer experience. Would love everything under one roof. Another feature that is needed, custom neck tags. Our business is going to be at the point within the next 3-4 months where we require custom neck tags to uphold the brand identity as we hit new follower milestones, so hopefully they adopt it soon or we will have to jump to a new platform that can accommodate our growth.
Update (6/4/2021): Fuel seems to have fixed the MAJOR issues they were having with production, hopefully that does not happen again. If it does, will definitely be my last straw with their service. That being said, they have returned to normal fulfillment times. It seemed like only when I mentioned that I was so unsatisfied that they started to care about giving me updates about the 30 day delays. I had to ask for refunds for old orders when as a company that should be automatic. They need to focus more on being customer centric and I think then they could become a top POD company, but they are long from there. I should not have to ask about refunds for things that should be so obvious especially when we do over 10,000 products a year with them. They also need a wider selection of products to compete with the other POD companies. For hoodies (top seller) they only sell ""low tier"" hoodies, and do not sell shorts or sweatpants of any kind. Those are major staples in our industry and are now getting those made by the thousands by an overseas vendor and using a 3PL. Wish I could have everything in one platform.
Update (5/6/2021): Wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt, but we officially hit having orders that are 30 days old, which is completely unacceptable. No clue how it takes 30 days to put an item in a printer. We have started to shop around for a new vendor, but the process of transferring all our orders would be a pain. They refuse to issue refunds for super old orders as an apology which is crazy, so I decided to refund the customers that are this overdue at my own expense, and eat the cost of the item since I still want them to receive it and provide good customer service. Hopefully they can return to normal turnaround times soon or else we will be forced to leave Fuel out of respect for our customers.
Original Review:
Quality: Not bad for the price. The print comes out right 98% of the time. We have shipped over 7,000 items from them this year and I would say we had issues on about 100 of them. Shipping: Shipping, especially international, can be super slow. Some international shipments take at least a month for delivery. Domestic can be quick, depending on where it ships from and if it is DHL ecommerce or USPS Priority. Turnaround time: This is my biggest complaint. Sometimes they ship stuff out in one day, sometimes it takes a month. We currently have 8 orders that are almost 30 days old. That is not acceptable for any business, and I wish they would recognize that and give some refunds like any other proper business would do. Customer Service: Respond pretty quickly, but sometimes they have a hard time understanding what I am asking for. I think the customer service is international based. The App: The app must be accessed through Shopify, you cannot access it on a standalone website. The system is relatively dynamic, but when you try to change existing items, etc, it gets pretty complicated. Luckily their FAQ gets updated somewhat frequently. Overall: If they could just fix their turnaround time, or at least be sympathetic to their customers when they get promised from customer service that are not kept, they would be able to compete with the big players in POD. I work with other clients that could bring them thousands of orders per year each, but I am refraining from bringing them over to the FUEL because of turnaround times."
App interface no longer works. From other reviews seems like the developer is sayonara. The good news is that you you download all redirects. We are going to add redirects one at a time in Shopify as you can fully export and Shopify likely is not going away. @shopify please allow build imports of redirects. Thank you.
J'utilise l'application et c'est super juste que j'aimerais modifier les données structurées je sais pas si on peut le faire directement à partir de l'interface de l'application?
"Looks like a pretty straight forward app, clean easy interface. I haven't had time yet to run an ad set yet, but I can't hurt to have someone in your corner."
Great interface. Very helpful app. Can't wait to put it to full use.
"AMAZING!
I can't believe found this app for FREE!
It got an amazing user interface and absolutely wonderful features.
Easily help me to monitor my store traffic and sales in details.
- The interface absolutely top-notch!
- The forecast feature also quite neat
- and a lot more.
Seriously, install this app now and you'll be pleased with it!"
"This is a great app, our products pages are now easy to read and give our customers a much better user experience."
"This is a must have app to increase your user experience, knowledge or whatever that you think may increase the buying desire. Tabs let you make your product pages rich with information for buyers as well as decreasing the length of the page. People can only open the tabs they want, but if they don’t, it’s easy for them to get to the “related Products” and then the footer of the page. If you don’t have tabs, it’s so tiring for people to scroll through the information which they saw 3 minutes ago while visiting your other product. Then finally after viewing a couple of products, they get tired of seeing the same things below the product description and leave. I've had these guys' apps before, and I always ended up giving them 5 stars. App Functions: 1) Functions are more than enough to give you a detailed and personalized tab look. I really mean it. Width, length, border, color, border color, inside color, outside color, open color, closed color, you name it you can make it the way your brand and website feels like. 2) You can add so many tabs above and below, and you can customize the content in the tabs freely... You can drag and drop the tabs to change their priority/section. Support: My tabs were opening upward. By mistake I asked them to fix it on the wrong theme, but after they fixed the issue I realized that I addressed them to the wrong theme. Long story short, they fixed it again on my other theme very quickly. Communication: They contact you back very quickly. I have contacted them multiple times for some small issues in the past. They clearly mention every detail and communicate with you, so you know what's going on. They also communicated with our programmer to help him adjust the tabs according to our desire and our theme. Improve Conversion Rate: If you DON""T know what to put in your tabs, go through the best in your industry, make a list of all they show to customers before purchasing. Then get the content of your list personalized and put it in your tabs as well as reviews. Advanced Ultra Sales Improvement: Make specific content for each collection and make the tabs show only for the specific collections. (I personally prefer to use tags for such situations, because with ""tags"" the tabs would still show up even if the product URL doesn't contain the name of the collection. ""Tags"" are gonna be added to the next versions of the app as I talked to the TK Team. But so far I'm using ""Types"", ""Vendor"" to get the results I just said. It's limited since you can only put one product type or one product vendor for each product, but I made it work so far, hopping to get the new updates soon) For example I have specific tabs for the rings, which give more information about sizing...etc"
"(update 2021) For over 5 years of use, we are blown away at the simplicity yet effectiveness of this app, as we could not find a single app that can do what this does. NONE. This is the ONLY app that we have found that fully integrates an omni-channel commission manager for your sales associates, and you can have your associates use everything from discount codes, drop-down sales associate choosing at checkout, associate code entered by the customer, and so much more. Also, if you need custom coding done to truly make sure the app and all its features work on your website, the team and especially Yury have been absolutely AMAZING at adding any and all coding to our backend design. We are so grateful to have this app, could not have our sales team without it! (from 2018) So far I have been very pleased with the app. It has a TON of features for a very affordable price. Yury is great at customer service and promptly responds to any questions, and takes suggestions for app development. I also want to list my development suggestions here so the public may also gain good info, here is what I believe this app should also develop: -Multiple or tiered commission for the same associate (to help separate retail vs wholesale orders for same associate) Keep it up guys, thank you for finally having an affordable and all-in-one package interface for my business!"
"Interface is cumbersome to use. Instead of having a simple spreadsheet like interface, you have to query a database using filters, then apply a single change across all products that meet your search filter. Who wants to bulk edit like this, especially when updating inventory?"
"This is one app that I'm happy to pay for. I use it all the time. It makes it so easy to update pricing across hundreds of products when I have a sale. When I updated my product pages recently, it took second to update all my product descriptions. It's also bee a GREAT help with my google/fb product feeds, and metafields in general. There was a time when I thought I would never pay for something like this, because I could just update my products in a CSV or the Bulk Editor. Nope...The interface for this one is just so much quicker and less painful."
"Great app and customer support. I have just implemented the app, but so far it is working great with easy to use interface."
"I hit the default buttons and it says it's making money for me, only the omnissiah knows if it's true but it's an easy interface for people who aren't professional builders (so basically everyone on shopify) and seems straightforward in regards to pricing"
"Originally, I used ReConvert to help with post-purchase upsells. When it worked, it worked fairly well. During our peak periods, it increase AOV 10-15%. Over time it was less effective, despite keeping the settings the same ... I cannot give reasons why things changed. Several of our users on mobile and desktop mentioned the upsells post purchase were somewhat confusing, ""in your face"" and/or they tried to apply the timer coupons but they didn't work. We decided to switch to Cart Upsell Drawer app in order to provide a better user experience. The configuration interfaces can be a little clunky, and hard to understand, but the results were fairly great. Ultimately, different apps can work well your store, only you can decide. I'd recommend you test ReConvert, and I'd recommend you test out other upsell apps as well to see what works. Always be testing."
"Amazing app. Super simple to install, launch tests and view performance. Well designed tech allows for a seamless user experience across test variants. Awesome support team that replies quickly to any questions you may have. Ten stars!"
"Just installed - but so far so good! Really easy to install and the user interface looks great. Hopefully, this will help my customers!"
App does exactly what it needs to. Its super easy to set for any one. User interface is simple to use and you can have ready in minutes. Really nice and simply design and loads quickly. Support is also excellent what had some customer position i required. They went out their way to really help. Ive tried a few ccy apps and this was the winner.
"The interface is friendly, the operation is simple, the functions I need are all, and the loading speed and positioning conversion are also fast. I found several APPs, and finally selected BUCKS. I am very satisfied at the moment and hope to keep it. come on! recommend!"
Very good App to analyse where the user comes from or what you can improve in user experience. It's easy to use and concentrates on the most important things
"Route's interface is super easy to navigate, user-friendly, and adding your branded content is effortless. Route thought of everything when it comes to clearly communicating with your customers. Reporting and resolving issues is seamless and has added another layer of customer support for our service team."
Great app for those who use Japan Post to ship orders. Easy to use interface with options to configure your labels. I must also mention that the Lunaris team is awesome when it comes to support and adding features. They are committed to their customers and to improving their product. Definitely a five star service!
Support was great! The interface is straight-forward and quite intuitive. Would appreciate a feature to send out emails to customers who had purchased before the promotion was set up. These customers were automatically entered into the promotion (sweepstakes/raffle). The system can't automatically generate email confirmations of their entry into the promotion (sweepstakes/raffle).
"Its super easy to add to store and the interface is very friendly and also it works super fast, that is the best advantage of this one! I have tried several apps,but this one works perfect!"
"Great experience using Viral Sweep for a giveaway, thus far. Intuitive interface and easily implemented on our website."
"This is the only app that matters for giveaways, contests, and waitlists. The user experience is elevated and Giancarlo is great."
Absolutely essential app for list building with a ridiculously easy user interface and rock star customer service. Seriously this app is critical to growth and the customer service is outstanding.
"I've worked with ViralSweep since the original version was released, and we always had strong results. I recently moved to the new version, which is a massive leap forward in functionality and user experience. Additionally, Giancarlo has been exceptionally responsive for all of my myriad inquiries. I 100% recommend this product!
UPDATE: I continue to recommend this app for its fantastic functionality, and Giancarlo just helped me customize the look of a particularly important promotion. Thanks, ViralSweep!"
"This is an extremely generous app, with the free tier giving a huge amount of functionality and flexibility over appearance. The customer service is also excellent and are very quick to respond and assist. This app is under constant development so flagging issues quickly gets them resolved.
I found the interface slightly complicated with areas which lack polish, but with perseverance it's possible to achieve what is required. I'm confident that this app will only improve further in the future. I would recommend this app to others."
Very helpful staff that gives quick and clear answers. The app has an easy to understand interface which is great.
"L'expédition était ma principale source d'angoisse en créant mon site ecommerce, et cette app me sauve la vie! Interface super pro, qui automatise la gestion du transport de manière intuitive et très complète, et La Poste/Colissimo est le meilleur partenaire pour livrer partout, sans intermédiaires. Cerise sur le gâteau l'équipe derrière l'app est incroyablement réactive, bienveillante et va bien au-delà d'une aide technique, avec des conseils business hyper pertinents sur l'expédition. Je recommande vivement cette app!"
This app really is fantastic! Allowing us to ensure customers are able to reserve an item that is arriving soon ensures that we are able to retain customers through Lockdown. Highly recommended Adam was fantastic with his advice and the app interface is easy to use and understand. 5 Stars
"The best thing about this quiz is, it is widely customizable. It collects important data to help the business. To be honest I understood the interface very easily and it was really fun to work on this app. Definitely recommending for your E-Commerce sites!"
"Very dependable support team! Jenny helps me with all the questions about the products I want to sell. They provide a simple interface that makes it easier to manage my orders, sourcing requests, and packaging. There are hundreds of different packaging options to choose from with the custom packaging feature."
"I love this app! It is easy to use with a great user interface. If the design settings isn't enough, you can always make custom CSS. The customer service team is also very helpful and respond very quickly."
"The app has a user-friendly interface making it easier to manage my orders, sourcing requests, and packaging. They will even manage 3 different stores for free."
Very impressive user interface and even without reading the instructions it has been intuitive enough to create a fantastic product recommender
"I love this app. The functionality of being able to choose which orders you want to sync with it allows you to use with various sales channels with ease. Also, I hadn't been able to get my thermal printer to work with LaPoste's own interface, but with this app I have been finally able to print all my labels and save loads of time. ++"
"I have been using Buckydrop's purchasing, warehousing and parcel-packing services for 3 years now and I am very satisfied with their service. They have a wide range of other services too (e.g. white labelling, vacuum packing) that are highly customisable and competitively priced. It takes my mind off the operations so that I can focus on growing my store. I absolutely love their customer service as well. They are highly responsive and reliable. It does take a while to navigate their user interface/website though, as there are many functions and services available. Overall, I highly recommend anyone who is starting a dropshipping store to try this app."
Une appli qui facilite vraiment la vie ! Parfait pour générer rapidement un grand nombre d'étiquettes Colissimo. Interface très fluide et SAV hyper réactif et sympa. Je recommande vivement.
"l'application qui change la vie des ecommercants, et fait gagner un temps fou !! Le petit plus, que la page du suivi la poste, s'intègre dans l'interface de votre site pour rester cohérent avec votre identité ! Vraiment top !"
"I've been through just about all the Options apps shopify has to offer.  This one held great promise.  Good interface, customizable in the simplest way - very self explanatory.  First flag - no other reviews.  Second flag - support was delayed which isn't that big of a deal since I figure they are a few oceans away in time zone.  But the third flag - they had access to my store without securing a staff or collaborator account.  I had no control of what they could access.  That is scary.  I uninstalled as soon as I was aware . . . ??  Fourth Flag when I got the follow up email to tell them why I removed the app the page errored.  Not a good sign."
"I switched to NoFraud from another guaranteed fraud prevention provider. My approval rate improved, pricing was more competitive, NoFraud customer support is superb and the user interface is intuitive and informative. My only regret is that I did not make the change sooner"
"Never Before have i experienced such amazing technical support, thank you Shane!!. I downloaded sync logic as I need to connect both stores inventory. Also I want a system to list directly to my second Shopify site, so all I now need to do is rewrite unique content for the second site listings once it adds them, this will save hours of work each month
If you need the same requirements as mine above you will find it hard to beat this app for price, other apps offer similar features but are too expensive and complex. This app is so easy once you have set it up. 
This is the only app I could find that could do it for a reasonable price. Shane was there on the phone to help me really quickly, even though I am in the UK and he is in Canada. So far the app if working great
I simply gave shane my login permissions for both my wholesale and retail sites and he set it all up for me, I just told him what sync rules I wanted and it was easy as pie. The interface is so simple to use. 
Looking forward to using this longterm
Thanks"
"The best app and support I ever had!! :-) highly recommend.
Even though it is not exactly what i looked for but the user interface, the design and the logics behind are so easy to understand! very good job!"
"Love the interface, super easy to use and a great price for affiliate software. Would definitely recommend."
"I honestly have nothing good to say about this app. I downloaded the free trial in 2021 and was BOMBARDED by customer support emails and phone calls. They were calling me up to 5 times per day and emailing me to help me set up because I had not printed a label. I ended up deleting the app because I was so annoyed by their calls. I decided to give it another shot today as our business needs a more streamlined shipping solution, but none of our current orders will import from Shopify. I think it is expensive for what you get in the first place, but the outdated interface, lagging order imports, and overboard customer service make this app a hard no for us."
"Best affiliate app suited for our needs. With recent total redesign even much better user experience. An overall no-brainer for us as the team from Enlistly was adding requested custom features extremely rapidly.
Definitely recommending."
"Shipstation is a fantastic platform for managing shipments! I've been using it for over a year and a half, and it continues to surpass my expectations. Pros: - The interface is nicely laid out to give access to all of the tools we need without being overwhelming, with good navigation and tab organization - You can set up customized filter and column views, and save them as tabs for easy repeat reference - The search function with advanced search is very accurate and reliable, with options to fine tune the results extensively - Product info can be updated with selective imports so you're not overwriting any existing data - There are multiple stackable options for product and order organization to give very granular control over your systems - The automation rules are extensive, with virtually every product and order variable usable as an automation trigger - Built-in batch fulfillment with the ability to generate batches through both automation and manual filtering: if you've set the item weights/boxes/customs info/batches/filtering/etc up correctly, you can process orders near-instantly - Networked printer integration: if you set up the connection with Shipstation Connect (free desktop application) on one computer, you can print from Shipstation on any device - Support is quick to respond and very knowledgeable - The documentation is extensive, easy to understand, and simple to navigate through - The pricing is also very affordable for the amount of time we save - It has integrations for all the platforms we use and can manage multiple stores and couriers The only notable con is that Shipstation currently lacks built-in tools for tracking packing materials: you can create custom box sizes and add them to orders seamlessly with both automatic and manual options, but you can't add a weight to a box listing and have the order weight adjust automatically when you change the box, or remove a box from inventory when you process a shipment. Small thing, but annoying: we end up adding the box weight to the product weights so we can batch fulfil our 1-2 item orders, but it messes all the calculations up for multi-item orders. Overall highly recommend, Shipstation is an excellent platform: I've recommended it to several small business owners in passing, and I'd recommend it in general to anyone who has to track orders."
"PROS
Clean interface.
Easy for affiliates to create custom links to specific products.
Individual Affiliate percentage... for example you can assign at signup 10% and if you have a hot seller you can reward him/her with a custom percentage like 25% while all others would still have 10%.
CONS
It's really hard to tell if it's working properly. They don't give you any link activity. The dashboard only shows order totals based off commissions earned so there's really no indication that it's syncing to your store. Maybe have a real store total of sales... Total of Sales based off of what your affiliates sold...  
You don't have the ability to assign a banner to a different product... Not all banners I would want to point to the main page making customers search for the product in the banner. 
No bulk export for PayPal mass pay."
"Thinkific helped us diversify our business and pivot quickly to continue adding value to our community. The platform is intuitive and easy to use. I was able to customize the user experience with the help of the Thinkific support team. They've been amazingly helpful and responsive to work with. I highly recommend this app for any business, organization or school wanting to add education to your site!"
"We use ShipStation for all of our domestic shipping. I like that the interface has all the info we need, and it works well for batch processing. We use our own shipping rates (not ShipStation's)."
User-friendly interface. Clean editing process. Finally an automated email service that has all the options I need.
"Super easy to use and a really clean interface - I tried a couple of Quiz apps and they were very confusing to use, but this one was easy. Also a really hands on support team who get back to you really quickly. Would recommend!"
"Super patient support and functions as intended. A few small quirks to learn how to navigate the interface when initially setting it up (as I've found with just about every Shopify app). Still a bit of work to be done on support documentation, but when they respond as quickly as these guys did it's not a huge concern.
I've run a bunch of tests and everything seems to be working perfectly."
This app was great to use and easy to implement. Our community loved the experience and the interface was super intuitive. Will definitely be adding more quizzes for our customers to use.
Really great tool and the best quiz platform we've tried. Easy to use interface and very customizable to your theme.
"Love this company. Just like their email marketing app, the popup app is incredibly easy to use and is as customizable (or not) as you like. I can't say enough good things about their user interface - it's really well integrated with the Shopify theme. Will try any new app they publish!"
"i like this app, its helpful to import ali products. interface is a bit clunky and could load faster but its very good and my support guy Raz sure helped a lot!"
"Just started my Shopify Store and looked at a few different SEO Apps. SPO is an excellent option, it provides exactly what I was looking for. The interface is easy to use and the updates are quick."
"Very easy to use; good interface would recommend. Since its free, it really helps small businesses get a head start"
"I downloaded this app needing to input 10 products to my store from Aliexpress. They have different plans ranging from the basic to enterprise. Even though I didn't need it, I selected the enterprise plan to see which features they had for my free trial. I forgot to cancel the plan until the trial was well over so I contacted their support team to request a refund. They told me that they could allow the refund and asked me to contact Shopify to process the refund. I did so, and Shopify contacted them back for approval. They then decided to conveniently deny my refund request.  If you want honest customer support, these developers are sorely lacking in it. 
The app itself is pretty bloated, and there is not much of a difference from the basic and enterprise plan. The UI is not really conducive to a good user experience. Please be warned that there are more customer oriented apps out there for drop shippers."
Highly functional app. Easy enough to use interface. Excellent customer service and support. I asked a question and their support team assisted me and fixed a major component on my website that the app was needed for. One thing that would be a great addition would be a way to display all products on auction in an editor page instead of scrolling through pages to access products in the app interface. Overall very happy with the app and service.
App works very good. Clear set-up process and great customer service. It was free to sign-up. Straight forward interface. great results
Customer support is world class! The user interface is nice and easy to use. Legit FREE. No hidden paid services. Great app for shipping at a discount.
Customer support seems to be top notch. Interface is friendly and easy to use. No hidden paid services. Pretty great app!
"We used different metafield apps and this is by far the best in terms of user experience and customer support. The app team is amazing.  They did their best to ensure that we fully benefit from the app features. Their response time is amazing too. They always replied to our emails in no time.  We highly recommend this metafields app in particular if you are not familiar with coding. The app has built-in  metafields and it's very easy to display these fields in the storefront. Furthermore, the app team will surely help you to unlock all the potentials of Shopify metafields."
"Best customer services. I like the app, it really help me save lot. The interface is easy to work on."
"User-friendly interface lets you customize your badge which is great!  Also, the customer service is wonderful, they get back to you and help you out with any issues in a very timely manner.  Would recommend this app!"
"10/17
Great potential! Exactly what I need it to do. First the pros:
1. Simple set up. Worked instantly. 
2. Easy, simple, to the point interface.
3. The tutorial shown was perfect. Quick, to the point, told me what I needed to know.
4. Being able to compare 'scanned items' to 'unscanned items' is GREAT. I love being able to take a quick glance and make sure I didn't miss anything.
And now a few suggestions:
1. The price point is really high if this is all the features that are going to be included.
2. You should be able to also manually enter a number after scanning if needed. For example, I carry lots of styles, and some only have 1-2 available (so I just scan-scan) and some have 50+. I am not scanning 50 items, I'd rather just take a second to count them, scan one, and update the inventory. I could do this natively in Shopify, but flipping back and forth would be a pain.
I'm SUPER excited to see where this app goes from here, I think it's so close to perfect as is right now if you can drop the price point OR add more useful features."
"Interface could be more user friendly but their support team is super helpful! As a Canadian company, we finally have the opportunity to offer US return labels with Postmen and AfterShip Returns Center."
I have a great user experience with your prompt customer support. They are always there just a few minutes of waiting!
The support live chat is very helpful to help me set up my FedEx account (so i can use my own rate)! Thanks Postmen team. Good to find a shipstation alternative with a more simple interface.
"I used the app to help me generate USPS and DHL labels. So far it is really easy to use with simple interface, with live chat customer support."
"great app does what it says on the tin, easy to use, easy to schedule sales, clear interface. Would recommend"
"Great app functionality. I wasn't able to use it in the store I'm building due to some of my unique fulfillment requirements but it's perfect for what it's made for. Great user interface, lovely support staff, and great overall product. I will definitely be using Postmen on future projects! You won't regret your purchase!"
great free app - works well for all that i need - simple to use and easy to use interface. simple. free and actually works
"The Polyglot Translation App is great in use. It translates absolutely everything, even custom sections. Not only super user friendly but also an outstanding support service. Thanks to the clear interface and the import option we translated our Mc Alson webshop in no time!"
"This App is really the best CRM I've used. Simple to set up but great in all features... Salute to Mark, the technical support so far, very detailed.. and to Sonika who is always there to assist via WhatsApp. I will keep on referring this App to my other friends. I like the overall interface of this app. -Christian"
"Updated, I've tried it again as it was the nicest interface of all the CRMs that I've tried. The DNS setting were eventually sorted out but it wasn't particularly easy. I'm going to try it for a month or two to see if it justifies the cost. I really wanted to like this app. Lots of promise, looks great and has lots of potential. The support is excellent too. The big problem for me is that it is just too difficult to set up - even support couldn't solve our issues. For a premium priced app, it should be seamless - but it just isn't."
"Absolutely great customer support app! I looked at a number of apps on Shopify for my customer support team and Rich Panel hands down is the best. The user interface is amazing, the integration with my Shopify backend is seemless, and the support team for Richpanel is extremely helpful, fast, and competant. In addition, I was able to speak with the founder and he is a super savvy, smart, considerate, and welcoming person who was a pleasure to speak with. If you are looking for a support app/customer service app, stop searching...you found it."
"I'm supposed to click 6 stars because of the great after-sales service. Kudos to Sonica and the team. I love the interface of the CRM tool. Easy to navigate, to make notes, and love how messages are like messages in Cellphone that has a thread. I like the update which is a colorful inbox. Highly recommended. I've tried a lot of CRM, but this one is the best."
"We previously used both Gorgias (18 months) and Zendesk (3 months) and RP blows them out of the water. Not only is the interface much cleaner, but the functionality and reporting are more robust. Our CS has markedly improved since switching to RP because of the better system but also because of the self-service option. You can end your search for the right CS platform here."
"Honnestly, this app should get a serious review of the Shopify app store...
The first red flag for me was that the copyright on their user-interface says 2014... I mean, in how far should you trust a payment gateway system that hasn't updated their copyright since 2014, or even taken the time to add the necessary code that shows the current year? (What about GDP regulations of 2019?)
I installed the app and honestly was very skeptical from the start: there are countless grammar errors on the user-facing side of the app, the whole user experience doesn't make any sense, as it displays different installation processed in different places + it seems like there are no actual fixed names for any of the functionalities. I believe that this app was written by a single person, which also leaves me a little worried. 
Now, the actual installation doesn't actually work... The ""install embedded app"", which I believe should either take you to an app that would create an embed on the front end of the website or install the code for it, simply redirects you to the first page of the app. 
I then contacted support, which I believe wrote the app (Warrin), he didn't address the issue that I mentioned in my message but instead asked me to ""Then finally do a copy of your PayPal credentials into your dashboard, per steps below"". Strangely enough, the app doesn't have any inputs for these Paypal credentials, which I also mentioned in my message, but he didn't address the issue. 
Then, what I found very strange, is that the app and he specifically ask you for the Paypal credentials. (Email address + Password + Signature). * This is against Paypal's terms. 
A third-party app that functions with Paypal, should make use of the technology using API keys or webhooks, and never ask a user for the account email or password directly. 
Anyway, I now deleted the app from the store, and I believe that Shopify should seriously review this, and I believe that the developer should make sure to update the app, remove the bugs, have a clear user experience (not use different terms in different places), and review its functionality to ensure it's actual operations are legal. 
I wouldn't waste my time downloading, as the actual app simply doesn't even work..."
"We had some questions about some functionalities of RichPanel and reached out to the helpdesk. The helpdesk was very swift in responding to our requests, and managed to help us to achieve our goals in setting up some automation configurations within RichPanel interface. Even though we are still on the free plan, we are still getting a very quick responses from them. The level of services are excellent, and would definitely recommend others to use their services."
"Not sure why some of the negative reviews below. I've managed to install and create this as a payment alternative in Shopify settings easy enough.
Can't comment much on the sales side of this app as my shop has only just gone live. I've tested the processing of an order and it all seemed alright.
I'm drawn to this type of payment system because of my business type it works much like an artist commisions that require a deposit to start and remaining balance paid on completion.
I'm giving these guys ago because of my target market (Australians) are addicted to lay-buys & those other get now and pay later systems and this gives those people another option.
Not to be rude towards Lay-buys but I think you need to hire a graphic/web designer to improve your brand identity and the user interface as it looks a bit dated. Fixing this will build confidence in those who wish to use your payment option and give shop owners a better hook when selling your payment option to customers.
Besides that, this app deserves more attention as it is a great concept and shops would benefit from using it."
"We're always finding more ways to take advantage of all the Richpanel features!  
Our customers' experience has seen a dramatic improvement since switching to Richpanel.  The interface is attractive, and customers can quickly get answers to many questions without talking to an agent.
Our team loves it too, it's easy to use, and agents have order and customer information at their fingertips.  
I highly recommend this app, the Richpanel team is fantastic to work with, and we now have multiple stores using it; we couldn't be happier."
"We were unaware of this app until we were contacted by one of their team, Jodie. Jodie was fantastic in explaining the app and providing a demo. She was on hand to provide after installation support. The app itself is very slick, blends into our own website and interface, making it comparable to some of the returns platform featured by high street brands. It has elevated our brand as one customers can trust. Top marks to the team and Jodie in particular."
"I HIGHLY recommend Omnistar! We have evaluated quite a few affiliate software platforms on the market, and this is BY FAR the best I have seen. And not just in Shopify, I'm talking ANYWHERE on the internet. To top it all off, the Omnistar team provides excellent customer service. Arlen is a ROCKSTAR! The timely response received through the ticketing system has been insane, and let's you know that they value their clients.
If you know your way around the internet you know how important a high quality system like this is, if you want to grow and not fade away into the endless see of online businesses. Also, you need a platform you can rely on as your affiliate base and sales grow. You can't have a platform crashing on you or losing data, etc. You can reliably develop a serious affiliate workforce with Omnistar and grow your business by leaps and bounds...easily.
My final take: this platform is intuitive. The backoffice is smartly laid out...nothing confusing there. And the customer facing interface is beautiful. You will also have access to an extensive resource database to learn from. If you're like me and enjoy being able to find your own answers to things, you will appreciate this. Omnistar is high-end software folks, and we've just about tried them all. And the cost is both well worth it and affordable. Do yourself a favor and save yourself the trouble of evaluating affiliate platforms from the other various vendors in Shopify. This is the platform you need, hands-down!"
"At first I was pleased with Omnistar's flexible dashboard and what seemed to be a straightforward interface. Unfortunately, after a week of working with their tech support to integrate the software with Shopify it was still not tracking my affiliates' sales. After being told it was fixed several times only to see yet another sale go untracked I threw in the towel and move to Zreferral (which worked the first time - no headaches).  This app has lots of potential, but at this point simply doesn't work. Don't waste your time until they get the kinks worked out."
Very easy and very helpful to use. I have been able to add and remove tags very easily with a few clicks. User interface is simple and friendly. Helped me to reorganize my store.
Gostei da interface com o Instagram e da rapidez no aviso das mensagens no celular. Prático e eficaz.
"perfect customer support. i am really glad to work with them. great work,great customer support, great user interface"
I used the app to sync multiple orders against paypal references. Its just made it about 100 times easier as a business just starting out. Interface is easy and straightforward.
"We have used Interakt for the last 4 months that the store has been live. Interakt offers easy integration and a communication interface that's easy to use. My teammates have used the app for other stores built on Woocommerce as well. The team is quick with support and thorough in providing help. The app lacks features around taking orders online on whatsapp, and managing chat labels efficiently (you can't analyse the number of conversations by labels, for example). This is the reason why my rating is a 4-star instead of 5. Looking forward to more meaningful updates in the future."
"Its a great app for WhatsApp integration on Shopify website. The team is supportive and very easy to reach. They have easy to use interface for setting up the notifications via WhatsApp. and we really like the inbox view which pulls all customer details from Shopify. Overall, a great app and easy to use and deploy."
They have a very easy to use interface. And the customer service was quick to respond and very helpful.
"Great idea for an app. The interface of the app is very modern with a lot of features. I will have to test it out more and experiment with the stories. Also, the support team was great, they helped me out with some custom changes in a very short period of time."
Really good app and nice support! I wanted such an app for a special purpose and it does exactly what it should and more. The interface is very clean & easy to use. Great job !
"Perfect!! Free plan with full rotating bar and easy interface. Colors, gradients and different fonts. It works without problem. Thank you for this wonder!"
"Very easy interface and set up, works smoothly and fully automatic! Highly recommented for every store."
Great app to organize online chat and FAQ on the website. Easy and simple interfaces. Waiting to get more functionality in future
"Very fast assistance, well trained staff, very functional app! I can absolutely recommend you Countdown Timer. The staff changed our theme to improve the interface and the functionality of the timer, in the required pages."
"Amazing app to have on your store! It took me some time learning the interface but after I figured it out I love it! Fully customizable, a great addition to my store."
"I chose to stick it out with this app for a while longer since I have a small membership. I am still very frustrated that I have never gotten replies on my inquiries and had to figure out my own solutions for some of my troubles. That said, I've made it work because I really do love a lot about this app. I like:
- The way I can categorize the posting sections and tag them so users with certain permissions can see each one.
- The look and feel and entire layout
- The polling and product options in posts
- The icons I dislike:
- New issue - the badges are no longer available and all settings in the USER category just displays ""This feature is no longer available on your forum.""
- Lack of response on questions
- Redirect issue for plan selections which caused me to lose paying customers
- Clunky - No reward system for users (but I know that's just me.) ;)
- Workarounds I've had to do with tagging and allowing for permissions and creating my own subscription since I can't get theirs to work and they don't respond + the manual labor this causes with every subscription
- Easy to navigate on the back end  Dec 2020
This app is honestly REALLY great and perfect in a lot of ways. However, I am using it for paid users and they are unable to pay for a membership due to getting routed in circles back to log in every time they click the plan they want to purchase. I am losing customers now and have been waiting for a response for two days. I like the app so much, that I'm looking into doing my own subscription service and tagging the accounts for access instead of doing the billing through shopicial. It's just not automated, so that sucks. But, they may be able to keep me as a paid customer if I can figure out a workaround. It's just really not ideal. I am starting to feel like I cannot trust them since they don't respond very quickly and I can see my issue has been happening for others for some time. ONE time they did respond within 24 hours, so that was nice. I completely understand it's likely a very small company with limited resources, but leaving people in the dark is just not helpful. I see a few others mentioning issues with Google ads - Shopicial made a VERY clear notification that pops up in the dashboard about this issue with specific JS files. They give directions on how to remove the files and I'm a novice and was able to follow this and get my Google ads back up in less than 24 hours. So don't let that deter you. Happy to update the rating when I hear back from them! Nov 2020
I am on day 6 of 7 with this app. My chief complaint is that I inquired with support days ago and have yet to receive a response. This makes me nervous that if there are issues that pop up, as they inevitably will with any software, that they might not get fixed right away. =( This is a big enough deal that I knocked two stars off. That said, I would give the software's UI (user interface) a 5 star. I found it easy to understand and navigate and didn't need a tutorial at all. I just simply clicked through each section on their dashboard and figured everything out be reading. I think the software itself is great because it sort of looks like Facebook so customers will be familiar, but is less chaotic and also NOT Facebook. The categories also make it a lot easier to keep things organized, vs a Facebook group where EVERYTHING is just lumped together in one feed. I LOVE the icons for the categories and feel it all looks very professional. The way you can search and post your products on a post is also a super cool feature. All in all, I think this software does more than it appeared to at first glance. That said, as long as some bugs get fixed and support replies to me, I would be willing to bump this up to a 4 or even 5 star app. Some of what's wrong - The notifications are not working correctly at the moment for some accounts, so this is alarming for me. If my coaches are tagged and they don't get a notification they will not know that they need to respond. If you have multiple things forums with different levels of access, you will need to manually tag the accounts if they are to access more than one level because of the way the settings are set up. You can only give ONE tag access to a forum. For example, I have 3 tiers with my membership. Each tier gets more access. The top tier therefore needs to access 3 categories, but can only access one until I go in and manually tag them. No big unless you have a large volume of users or people want immediate access. The webpages on this design are also not all the way responsive. The forum itself is, but not the gated page to the forum where people will log in or learn what they're looking at. Finally, there's no way I can age gate the forum. But I recognize this would fall under a feedback category, not a software issue. ;)"
"Fairly priced, amazing support, great technology and interface, Not much more you could ask for. Such an awesome company!"
"I have been using PickZen for our site and it works wonderfully. It provides an easy-to-use portal as the backend so you could know what's going on when your customers go to your site and try out the product recommendations. After using it, our conversion has increased by more than 100%, the customizable design of the interface also allow us to integrate to our site very easily, in a seamless manner. The tool is highly customizable overall, it's suitable for different products of different industries (especially if you have many products). 
If you're looking for a tool that gives your customer a personalized recommendations. You should definitely go to PickZen. It's interactive too, you can use it for different purposes (such as A/B testing, product filtering etc). Since it's connected to Shopify, your products can easily go into PickZen with a few clicks. I'll be trying out their other tools too, can't wait!
Oh did I mention the team is great too? You can count on them on various issues and integrations!"
"Excellent Timer with a very comprehensive interface, easy setup and fast load speed. Works perfectly."
"The app is incredibly user friendly. It's ready to go out of the box. I installed it but then didn't get around to customizing it for a couple of weeks. Then I discovered it was bringing in a lot of sales. By default, right at install, there are 5 flows preconfigured for you, even with engaging gifs - without making any effort to customize yet, all I did was activate these out of the box flows and they led to sales. The customer service is extremely responsive. The interface is very smart but also flexible, unlike some competitors. I'm currently testing additional apps, but so far, Postscript is the winner in all areas."
The functionality is good but the interface is a little hard to use. I have had this sat in the background over a year and it just does its thing silently. https://www.katysboutique.co.uk
Using this app i found a great result.User interface is very friendly & best app for marketing automation.hope to get the most out of it.
"Excellent app! Extremely convenient interface. All the features we need.
The price is very reasonable. The customer support is the best."
"I have a brick and mortar model train museum. We run trains for our guests. Two years ago we decided to start selling trains to pay for it. I installed Quickbooks desktop and Quickbooks POS. Later we built an eCommerce website using Prestashop. We sold something every now and then, and it was no problem. Then the business grew. And grew. We were having problems. Where was the inventory? What had we ordered? It took lots of steps in multiple systems to sell and ship stuff. Oh yea, we were on eBay too. They get really cranky if you sell something you don't have. 
We installed Shopify and linked it to Quickbooks. We moved to Shopify POS. Then we found and installed SKUlabs and it made our fulfillment processes much easier and much more organized. We use it for issuing POs; updating inventory; managing fulfillment and for keeping track of preorders. We have a lot of preorders. 
They have been terrific to work with. I've had lots of questions and I have needed lots of help, like setting up the printing of my price tags. Their customer service has been very good. I moved Quickbooks to online so as they develop those interfaces, I am looking forward to that integration, so that's not done yet. I'm still learning QBO. 
Here's a summary of how the business process works. When a new product catalog is released I import the products into both Shopify and QBO. Shopify loads SKUlabs. I collect online preorders from customers in Shopify and they flow to SKUlabs and I issue POs from there. When I receive the products from the vendor in SKUlabs, it updates Shopify. I load the vendors bill in QBO for payment. I send invoices in Shopify. As they're paid, the transaction comes back into SKUlabs for shipping and off to QBO to be recognized. 
For in stock purchases, Shopify sends it to both systems for shipment and recognition. In SKUlabs managing the orders are very easy. I use their tagging system to Seperate orders from preorders, holds, etc. I add notes to orders. I moved the shipping to them from Shippo and bought a scale. No problem. 
This isn't fully automated yet. I still need to do more with the platform. But we are off to a good start. These guys have been terrific. My wife and I both have full time jobs, this is a part time thing for us, but sales have really climbed. These guys have helped us a lot."
"User interface is very friendly, Best app for marketing automation support is also amazing. Hope to get the most out of it."
"I use Shopify to manage orders, however, it can't really help me to reduce the packers'  packing errors. 
So, I've been looking a long time for something like Skulabs which can help me to reduce the errors when fulfilling orders, and Skulabs is exactly what I need.
The interface is very easy to use, and I love the sound when fulfill the order. :)
Brandon is very kind, and always respond very fast with any of my questions!
I will definitely recommend Skulabs to anyone who struggled to find an app to reduce the order fulfill error."
"This is the best app in Shopify app store for maping your shipping locations. Interface is user frendly and very easy to operate. With this app you can split zipcodes in half. There is no other app like this in the store. I searched for something like this for two weeks and without results. I found the app 2 days before our shop lounch. I had one issue with the app and I contacted support. They replied realy fast, like 1 hour after I sent them an email. SO download this app and save some money on shipping."
does the work and really easy to use. best app for setting up contact us in your website. amazing interface
Very easy setup and super user-friendly interface. Only took me a few minutes to set up . I recommend. Thank you.
"Printrooster was an absolute game-changer for us. Before this app, we used to spend hours and hours on printing orders every week. Now, we can literally complete that task in seconds with total confidence that nothing slips through the cracks. Printrooster has also made it easier and more efficient for us to place purchase orders with suppliers through custom pick lists. The icing on the cake is the fact that you can fully customize and brand the UI in the app's interface, making it that much more enjoyable to use. Plus, the support team is incredibly generous, helpful, and responsive. Overall, the app has seriously exceeded our expectations and saves us more time with each passing day. We're beyond happy with it!"
fantastic service really loved how easy it was. really feel like i enjoyed te service especially because the interface.
"User-friendly interface, easy to setup and use, save me so much time and effort, it would be better if the request of the word count of the review is shorter."
"Simple and useful app. I was using another app earlier who were not responsive. Someone from this app team called next day to confirm if everything was fine and if we faced any issues. 
You can customise templates.
They provide some free SMS credits when install the app to test it out. 
You can have your own sender id
I liked that you can customise any sms template
Interface is also clean and neat
There is an option to send Marketing sms though I have not used it yet 
Also for those who are not clear on charges (I was not clear) - You have to recharge some amount (minimum is $30) and then your balance will be deducted as the SMS is sent according to the SMS charge for the country.
Overall good App."
"So far so good. Need to test and see if it works. Just installed, but the user interface seems really nice."
Love the app interface. Very easy and convenient to build a form for your website. They have a quick customer support team.
"great app - love the interface, clean and very easy to use with great features. the support is fantastic, very friendly and quick to reply."
Thanks for the great marketing app! App has useful and easy interface.I definitely recommended.Application working with no problem.
"Excelent app, with easy interface and many choices to help you with. Their staff is very helpfull and they reply fast. Is has Post Purchase Upselln abandoned Cart recovery and more."
Great customer service! Very quick to help and the app's user interface is simple and works very well!
"It's good, the final product is great, the support though is struggling very hard to cope with great amount of work.
We have used this app before in a WordPress/WooCommerce platform, we've come a long way with them.
We stick to them because their functionality provides a very mnemonic interface to the user, very intuitive, because it's something that our customers and our staff are used to.
One of, if not the best out there as a Shopify app."
"Terrible interface. Firstly their shopify intergration sucks, you have to import all contacts manually, secondly they have charged me twice for my plan but still keep asking me to upgrade. They say they have a live support, but when you write to them they ask you to drop a mail for everything to which reply comes in 2 days. Had a call with their agent after scheduling one, for everything he asked me to drop an email."
I have used several video hosting interfaces for websites. This is by far the easiest to use and their customer service is excellent. At a very affordable monthly rate I can host videos for our kinetic artwork. I use Vimeo professional to upload videos and then share the URL in Dynavi. Cut and paste...that's it! So easy.
"I really didn't want to give 1 star review, but the product on mobile is super buggy: upon a user hitting exit to the opt in - the pop up reappears again on other pages. I am using Chrome on OSX devices. I have expressed several times to the developer that I would like this fixed, he claims to have fixed it but the problem still occurs again. It's sad that the product does this and gives users a bad user experience. i have received some complaints and had to switch the app off. I am happy to update the review if this bug gets fixed."
"Not the easiest interface, bit tricky to use. It's a good idea, but I feel like they could better develop it."
"sucks, just wanted to add a custom field to collect customer info and it was impossible and their user interface is so confusing too"
"I installed this app specifically so I could have a personalization box for customers who are placing orders. I found YouTube tutorials to walk me through how to use the interface. I rated this 4 stars because I don’t find the flow and language of the input intuitive. Once I got a custom field set up, I could not figure out why it wasn’t loading onto my listing despite a lot of research and also speaking with a shop owner friend who used this app. I had to contact customer service. CS was incredibly responsive and helped me quickly. Turns out the app had to be enabled in my theme. I’m newer to Shopify so this may be common knowledge but I didn’t see documentation about this step which is why I struggled. I’ll continue to use this and I am glad there’s a low-cost option for listing customization that has excellent customer service."
"The Custom Fields app is amazing! I needed a way to add tabs to break up product details and specs, and I looked at several other apps, but none of them had the simple widget interface like this does. This app’s widgets allowed me to add this functionality and more that was missing from my theme without needing to hire a developer. I had a small issue with one of the widgets not working exactly how I wanted it to, and the support team responded to me within an hour to resolve the issue. Great app and great support!"
"stupid plugin. this app makes it so hard to remove, just make the remove button big and clear ok? not a good user experience"
I used this app for a couple of days now. The support was awesome. They sorted out two problems with our shop very quick. The app itself is easy understandable we got into it very fast. Did enjoy the support and easy user interface.
"Excellent design, layout and functionally. Beautiful and easily customizable. As if that weren't enough, one of their support members reached out to tell me about an interface error from the integration with my team, something I hadn't even noticed. Within a couple of minutes it was fixed. Now that's the sort of customer support you don't get anymore. Hence, my full recommendation and 5+++ well-deserved stars. Our store: www.hanfundhemp.de"
"great product 90% reacomended, just didn't like to approve the payment before I even see the app interface!"
I would give 5 stars. Very easy to use and simple. I love the app interface. i could see my store speed boosted from the very first use.
"I used this app for three concerts of our festival, we saved money by not hiring a ticketing service. Evey's system and interface are very intuitive and user-friendly. And additionally, they have great customer service (fast and helpful). I totally recommend them."
"This is the best app for AOP & DTG printing that exists, & here's why. The quality of the product is exceptional & surpasses competitors. The items are quality, the images represent them with crystalline precision. Second, the design tool offers unparalleled ease & gorgeous aesthetic user interface. Again, it's intuitive + operates seamlessly. This is A+ app development. The synchrony & harmony between the code & the visual + functional design. A breakthrough app that delivers platinum service + product."
"Zendrop is a PHENOMENAL app for anyone looking for the best possible way to dropship on Shopify. I've been in the dropshipping game for over 5 years and have never had such a clean back-end of my store. My customers are receiving their products in about 6-11 business days with full tracking. My favorite part about Zendrop is the team they have built. Jonathan, Jessa, Maria, Joshua, and the whole team is always right there when you need them, whether that be for tracking updates or new product inquiries. The app interface is also so easy to use, and so easy to link to your Shopify store. Would HIGHLY recommend Zendrop to anyone who needs a reliable, affordable dropshipping supplier. Stop using Ali Express and use these guys!"
"I don't know about shipping, quality and delivery, but it has very good reviews. The interface is super easy to use and non demanding on certain sizes. Therefor saving some time since my images are quite large"
"Un super service client, rapide et très compétent. Je commence tout juste ma boutique et cette solution me semble une bonne solution pour les avis. Simple et efficace. On peut importer des avis de l'extérieur via des CSV et l'interface en bas des fiches produits est sobre et jolie."
"The developer/founder was incredible in responding to my many tweaking of the widget on how it shows on mobile devices, love all the features and I am confident this app will help with my conversion. I have not launch yet but feel good about the possibilities with the assistance of this app to make the user experience on my store seamless"
"The interface is functional and pretty simple, so it is easy to use. The team is very fast to react to my questions."
"It is a very nice solution for people who already have a website and want an easy system to deal with sales. Also, very affordable and super easy to integrate. I use it with WordPress, and I like the interface a lot. It would be nice if, in the future, it becomes compatible with the plugin ""WPBakery Page Builder,"" which I use to build my WordPress. I needed to create a new page without using my building plugin so it could work."
Great customer service and really improved my store management performance. Easy and clean interface.
"First and foremost, I would like to address some of the reviews that disparage this app for being complicated and difficult to learn. The developers have posted DOZENS of step-by-step articles (buildateam.zendesk.com) that address almost anything that could arise while learning how to navigate the interface. There is always going to be a learning curve that ONLY trial and error will teach. But, for what this app is capable of, it is well worth the investment in time. At least for us, the cost of the app and the amount of time spent learning it has resulted in far less time on things that either don't work, or don't accomplish our goals. After two years of refining graphics for our Shopify Store (still under construction), We were convinced that our only choice for product page presentation was going to be to render the tens of thousands of possibilities for customizing our products ourselves, and split them into several categories and collections. Luckily for us, we spent most of that time on layered graphics illustrations, that can now be used to allow the customer to choose their own opinions, thanks to Custom Product Builder. Something we have always wanted to be able to do. This app has simplified our website development to the point where we are finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel ! We couldn't give it a higher recommendation...."
"Easy set-up, great interface, best of all it manages all my reviews. We were recommended this app by our Digital Marketing Consultant. This is a great time saver and it means I no longer have to manually create incentives to get my customers to do reviews on my site."
"We have been using DotDigital for over a year now and couldn't be happier with the program and service. The user experience is amazing and the features are well advanced. We send out weekly emails to our database and also have numerous automations running throughout the year. 
I would highly recommend DD to anyone looking for an email marketing platform."
"It needs work. Needs to be more user friendly and provide better User Interaction/User Experience. People find it hard to trust buying through this buy button, all my customers are using Paypal instead."
Easy to use product to create extra pages with the drag and drop interface. No code needed. Great customer service.
Great customer support. The app has great interface and does the job perfectly. It's very simple to use and has a lot of useful features
I really like this app they have perfect user experience I want to thank Claudia for helping me and for the perfect support
"I only made one page with it so far, but it was easy to navigate and add elements. Very simple interface. And their support was very helpful, also."
Very smooth interface and nice templates. The customer support is very helpful as well. The free plan is a very interesting starts for people on the fence.
"I want to personally thank the support and developers for amazingly attending to the queries to the point of chatting with them to ensure everything is working smoothly. The app itself has a very good interface and user experience. So far i have checked other wishlist and could not find a suitable one mostly are with limited wishlist. Until i found this and tried it, it works perfectly, even if there are issues the support will be able to assist your queries on a timely manner and i can't stress enough that we would highly recommend this app for wishlist use."
"Excellent app, instant reply to get the countdown timer set up properly, clean interface, couldn't ask for more!"
I used this app to create a landing page and I was happy with how user-friendly it was and how it used a similar interface to shopify. Ayushi helped to remove the Automizely branding; she was quick and very friendy!
"Exc user interface, good costumer support and easy interface to modify existing messages, types of whats app icons..."
"We changed from Shogun to Gempage and are confident with the change. The reason for the change was that at Shogun pages the buy button did not work always, which was really the badliest experience I ever had with a page builder. We did get phone calls of customers which tried to buy without success. That happened a second time again, after the first technical support. With Gempage we now have 1 year experience and had today the second small (code) problem which this time was the reason that pictures were shown in low 40x40 px resoltution instead real quality. The technical support service was amazing and delivered fast and good solution. But I await that landing page shopify landing page builders work 100% riskfree and take care that such problems never appear. I use a landing page builder to produce faster nice pages. I don`t want to risk that the user experience is badlier than without page builder or like with Shogun that a buy button at the webshop don`t work... The pages must work 24hours and 365day per year 100% secure and free of functional problems. I give 5 stars because of the good support and a second chance. But if something like this happens again during the next 2 years then we stop using page builder apps for shopify."
"I use this app weekly for in-person deliveries. I like the interface and the route optimization. I dislike its integration with other apps, such as maps and text messaging."
"Excellent app. It features a very easy to use drag and drop interface. They have great templates to help you get started. They also have great customer service. Mona helped me with several issues I had on my page, and resolved every one of them. Highly recommended."
seems good - trial period for the moment - but easy to plug for sure - and seems to be efficient - user experience needs time
"A very simple interface as compared to the complex Fb ad manager. I have started with 1 campaign so can't comment on performance as of now. I will edit my review after few weeks.
Special thanks to Rishiraj who was the support executive on chat as he was patient enough to hear and solve all my queries."
Une superbe application pour tunneliser toutes les pages du site et personnaliser facilement l'interface ! Le service client est particulièrement disponible et très aidant. Je recommande !
We LOVE GemPages! Their customer service team always goes above and beyond to help us- even with issues that are caused by other apps and themes. The interface is very user-friendly and packed with features- if you like to design but don't know how to code- definitely try it!
"GemPages is not only a wonderful application, it really helps us build out our store and company. From the user interface, to the customer support. Let me highlight that point, the customer service is AMAZING. I can't say how many times I thought something was impossible, or would have to be a ""feature,"" yet GemPages has always come through for me. Amazing team!"
"App is very easy to integrate with Shopify, ad platform/interface is easy to navigate and customer service is always very helpful. Our Account Manager, Carson, is always proactively reaching out to share new growth tactics to encourage performance improvements and never shoes away from lending a helping hand when our team's capacity is limited."
"I really enjoy this chat app and have been using it for over a year. I can even use it from my phone and chat with customers. Great interface and good options. I've used the basic free service but upgraded to the paid version because a promo was running. Extra features 4 paid version included file attachment with in chat, multiple chats at once,  multiple triggers. I definitely would recommend this chat app."
A great way to have an in-house registry. We just started using this app and really like the simple interface. Their support team being available for questions via chat is also really great. Highly recommend.
"I am sorry to say this because I really wanted this to work, but this app has major issues in usability, customer service, functionality, and overall for the amount of money spent on it. They need to work on their product before selling it to customers. It is, at best, in the development stage without any form of usability or QA testing for customers. Over 2 months ago I purchased their plan for $149 and it still does not work with Shopify. I have had numerous email exchanges with instructions that sent me to screens with errors on their website to set it up, and overall frustrations, and it still does not work. The app interface in Shopify keeps telling me I have to upgrade and purchase their plan and I have spent a few times checking my credit card to make sure it is not double billing. Not ready to use and they really need to either make it function or refund money to customers who cannot use their product. Two months is unacceptable to not resolve issues or to send information that is inaccurate for a product that does not function simply to install an app for dropshipping."
"I subscribed to the ProPlan of this app on Wednesday 4/1/2020 and, on the same day, I contacted ProPlan support asking a couple of questions via the correct link inside the app interface. Today is Saturday 4/4/2020 and no reply has been received, even though they promise priority support for ProPlan Subscribers. 72 hours is by no means priority support.
Additionally, after I subscribed to the ProPlan, the section on How to Update still says the following:
""If any error messages are received when updating your theme to the latest version, all customizations to the mentioned files will need to be carried forward manually. If you need assistance with carrying over your previous customizations, we'd recommend reaching out to some of our recommended experts.""
Here it is paramount to mention that the ONE AND ONLY point of this ProPlan subscription is to GUARANTEE a fully automatic, hassle-free theme update. The second I have to manually carry forward my customizations, I should be refunded for my subscription. I also asked about this on my support request three days ago, but I have received no response.
Please contact me ASAP with full response to my support request, including a clarification about what happens when the app does not work. Do I get refunded for a non-working app?"
The best app for image optimization. The app is easy to use and they have good interface. I recommend you this app
"Excellent Service beyond any imagination.
Superb app with alot of functions and very good user interface.
Everything is absolutely amazing with this app and the workers.
5 stars are not enough!"
Such a good app with easy-to-use interface and ez way for creating messenger ads. Recommended app for SME
"Very easy to set up. Very intuitive interface. My trial is over, and within the period I received 2 additional sales from AdMonks. We're still deciding how reasonable we think the fees are, and if we want to continue with their service"
Great app. The integration with Xero was easy to setup and the interface is very simple to understand and operate. Support is quick and helpful when needed.
"Background:
The way I see it, E-Commerce is a 5 minutes world today. 
You watch a Youtube movie, and suddenly you're a Shopify Legend. 
You read a guide, and you make your own store in 5-10 minutes.
You can't spend more time on it - you don't have much time, and it's very hard to focus. Know that feeling?
So many people open their E-Commerce stores, and they look ok or better, but they miss the other element which is sending traffic to these stores, and then keeping this traffic in, and monetized.
So you see many small and big apps that try to add the marketing dimensions into the blend, so essentially you can build your own store without any expertise, just choose the right theme, marketing apps, conversion apps, retention apps - analyze, optimize, rinse and repeat.
Kids play with Lego bricks, and adults will build projects and e-commerce using Lego too - adding all kinds of ready apps/codes to their store without having the knowledge. Here's where Admonks comes in to the picture.
I've been using this app for the past month and a half. I have no idea how this app has so few reviews, it's one of the best marketing apps that I'm using, in terms of ROI and Results. In my honest opinion this app deserves a 5 stars rating.
- The interface: Quite modern, extremely easy to create campaigns (literally 2 clicks) and you don't have to know anything about marketing. It's a plug and play. A click and launch. AdMonks knows what they are doing, so you don't have to.
- Reporting interface - very easy to understand, clear and reliable. I compare it with the FB Pixel data and with Google Analytics and get the same results. 
- ROAC - Return on advertising cost is at least 10x on our store. A point of note though is in place: every store will have different results. I think the best setup for AdMonks are stores that have more than 20-30 products in them (the more the better actually) and that have a lot of traffic. Than Admonks does better than other apps I've tried is chasing them on FB and get them to purchase. 
Help is very efficient, only had to ask one question, I doubt if you'd have to.
Flexibility is available and I've tried different settings of the ads too - found that the best settings are the default ones.
I tried different setups, all were profitable. Some more and some less."
"In the age of iOS14 and on, getting self reported user data becomes even more important for understanding how people found your store and why they opted to shop with you. Kno was super easy to implement in check out and an unobtrusive user experience."
"This app is absolutely AWESOME! They have affordable high-quality products and the fulfillment is super fast! They are still brand new, so there are still a lot of things they need to add, but I'm sure they will make this even better over time! They are based in China, but shipping rates are actually more affordable than US shipping rates. lol As it is right now, it's pretty good! They do have pros, as well as a few cons. Pros: - Affordable
- Design tool is AWESOME!
- Branding neck prints (only on the shirts)
- Nice products
- Fast fulfillment Cons: - Based in China (Probably the biggest concern if you're in the US)
- Small product catalog (will add more products in the future)
- Can't put any neck prints on hoodies/sweaters as of right now
- Ships from China, so there's no white-labeling (hopefully this changes)
- Only 1 decoration which is DTG Despite the Cons, this company has big potential! Also, all of their products are that oversized Chinese/Japanese streetwear style. I would only use this company if you want that kind of style. Maybe they will add other products that aren't oversized in the near future, but as of now GREAT company! Oh! customer service is pretty good! I haven't experienced anything unusual as of yet. The Time zone is completely different from the US, and their website interface is pretty decent. It needs a bit of work, but overall really easy to understand and navigate."
"Many useful and sale increasing additions for free.
Plenty of minimal and attractive designs to create the basic needed urgency!
Easy and helpful interface, recommended!"
Amazing App! Wonderful customer support! This will save us countless hours of manual work each week. I love the flexibility of writing custom formulas. Very intuitive interface and the developer Jonathan quickly answered all my questions. He even reached out along the way as I was setting things up to make sure everything was working out for us well. We were up and running in literally minutes. I wish this company all the success in the world as they surely have made my job easier. Thank you!
"Really useful app to submit the product feed with Google Merchant Center, user-friendly interface and very quick support. It has the option to choose a different title to improve SEO. The subscription price is really reasonable toping up with a 15 days trial which is really great. I will add more details after using it for a while."
"We are very pleased with this app. It addresses all our compliance needs and helps our visitors to have a clear control over their cookie preferences. They can opt in/out or choose what cookies to enable/disable. It also provides a very convenient way for our customers to handle their data - things like requesting existing data, right to be forgotten etc - everything is so simple. Last but not least, the app offers powerful customisation of the user-interface so it's never been so easy to create popup bars and popup windows in line with your brand guidelines. We needed some deeper level of customisation and when we contacted their support Georgi Georgiev and Emil Trendafilov from their team answered and resolved every single query we had. I am rating the app with 5 stars, only because there's no option to rate it with 6 stars!"
"UPDATE: The support imediately contacted me and after a couple of individual code adjustments they made it work for me (this took a few weeks but they kindly didn't charge me for it). The predictive search is now quite slow and the number of results is still shown even though the products themselves are successfully hidden. Unfortunately doesn't support quick search. My locked products got successfully hidden everywhere but still showed up on the quick search.
Nice interface and lots of functions but the incompatibility with my theme's quick search sidebar makes it useless for me."
"Another cool app from this company. Honestly, the interface is simple and straightforward and the app very easy to customise. I am using their full range of app for B2B and use this one to give access to my PRO section. Other app doing the same (and very good I am sure) but I am just trusting these guys now for my B2B business and price is OK. I like you can customise everything from one page (easier than other apps) and love(!) the step by step process to make sure your logic is the good one (once again, easier than other similar apps). For example, I also use it to block the access to my PRE-ORDER collection dedicated to my pro clients. You just indicated which clients are concerned (tagged clients in my case with the word PRO) then if they have or not access to this collection, and finally what happen if they are not authorised (in my case I redirect them to the signup form for pro clients). You can also block products or a blog pages etc. As usual, Adil and his team are super fast to answer, polite and cool... but for this app you do not really need any help as it is ready out of the box :) Do not forget to click on the enable button before digging into the settings...I mean... it would have save me 30min of time and an email to Adil (shame on me ahahah). The only improvement I can see will be to be able to block different type of contents in one workflow (ex: collection + pages +products). Today if you need to block these 3 types of contents for the same clients, you need to create 3 different workflows. But no big drama honestly as you setup the app in 10min."
Wow. Phenomenal user experience leading to a quick and easy setup. This was exactly what I was looking for for our site. Awesome
"The interface of this app is super easy to use, and the support team is very helpful! However, I wish that conditional tagging was easier to use and that tags translated to MailChimp as well as into Shopify*. Overall I am glad I chose to use this app! *You can still get it to tag in MailChimp if you have your Shopify also connected to MailChimp"
Super easy App. Thank you Alpha Shopping Feed. Very clean & easy to use interface! I recommend this app to anyone looking to easily add products to their merchant center.
"App is really helpful - but could do with some user interface upgrades to make it easier to use. We built a wholesale application form with it. There were some bugs, but the developers fixed them quickly and efficiently."
"Installed this app so that we could accept registrations from the US and Australia. Initially the app was not functioning as we had wished, but a quick message and literally anything and everything we wanted to tweak was done in a timely manner - allowing us to charge in AUD and USD. The app looks fantastic in desktop and mobile versions, interface is slick and has multiple features to adjust the design. Highly recommended - keep up the good work team."
"Recently installed the app.  It looks great, very professional, and feedback from our customer base is that they are impressed!  The support has been super fast and friendly so far and there are plenty of features I didn't know about before I installed it.  
The interface is clear and it's easy to use. 
Pricing is great compared to competitors.  Excellent experience so far."
"I have been looking for a simple to use loyalty app to use online and at my two shops. After extensive testing and playing I am happy to say the glow loyalty app works a treat. 
What was more impressive was Ryan and the Support team -  I had a few suggestions on improving their new VIP tier feature - especially the ability to manually adjust a persons tier from the console. As the VIP was a new feature they took on board all of my suggestions and comments and they were available to test the next day - and I have to say works very well.
The flexibility with the app is great for the  price. Other apps you had to be on their TOP plan to get VIP or Tier features and they cost $$$$. Glow gives you all the features to control the loyalty even on the basic plan, helping you grow the program from day one.
The widgets and interface is uncomplicated and clean - which makes it easy to use and get you up and running fast.
Thanks Glow!"
"I'm so glad I came across this app!! Just installed it, the setup was extremely easy, interface it top notch, looks amazing and so easy to navigate, layout is very nice. So far so great! Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
"Really easy to use and and is a really great tool for upselling. The interface of the app is user-friendly, you can let the app group the products together or you can manually select your own products"
"I have tested each and every single loyalty app in the app store, and this one came out on top. Another app with the same features will cost you $50 to $100 a month. Very easy to use, great interface and support is amazing. Had a little issue during set up and Brandon was a great help. Highly recommend this app!"
"If i were able to give more stars, then this company deserve them! I cannot fault this company in any way at all. The app interface is so easy to use. The customiser for customers is the best by far. I needed their help and within the space of not even 12 hours they were there for me. The products they offer are exactly what i am after. Thank you for amazing support, and amazing products. Also delivery to my country (United Kingdom) in 15 days, is amazing. I suggest anyone looking for POD you wont be disappointed!"
"I've tried several of these apps and this one is the best. easy to use interface, well priced and support is quick and professional."
Nice app! Easy to install and user-friendly interface. Three options for the Kakao button size and two options for button placement. Pricing is also very reasonable.
"TECHNICALLY MEDIOCRE APP:
- Very good Shopify integration for data flows, voucher generation, etc. (but others have similar features)
- OK email wizard (sometimes buggy so that you have to refresh, etc. but ok...); make sure you chose the new one (!) if you set up a test account; I first ended up in the old one which is a nightmare
- The brand-related items are by far worse than the beautiful pictures might suggest!
- One example: The possibilities to modify the DOI sign-up flows with regard to design, wording, brand appearance like fonts, etc. are extremely limited (it is for example not possible to have the important text elements with a lowercase ""you"" as it is correct in German; there is a ""German version"" with ""Sie"" and ""German (Informal)"" version which uses an uppercase ""Du"" but it is not possible to adjust that) - you can basically just put in your logo, select a font out of 15 different standard fonts, some colors and a translation version; that is not 2022!
- There are many ""strange"" limitations in the software; in some areas, there is a beautiful, modern interface with a lot of flexibility, in some others, there is just a very buggy old thing with weird restrictions and bugs ...WHAT IS SO BAD TO GIVE 2 STARS ONLY?
- The availability of the customer support is not acceptable! - And you will need the customer service if you want to use the tool for more than manual email campaigns because of those ""strange"" things I mentioned above (many of those issues are not documented and in most of the cases you will think ""this must be possible, I simply don't find the button"")
- Today, I managed to have 2 chats after about 1 hour of waiting time each; 4 further attempts failed because the chat with simply closed; 90 other users were waiting, too
- If you reach them, the quality is not as bad as many comments suggest, but still..."
"For an Amazon Associate, this app does what it claims to do. It is a fairly simple interface. The support was responsive when I had questions about the code. I am pretty happy with the app so far!. I recommend it!"
"Great app!!! I searched a lot on shopify app store. Finally, I see that this one is the best. It has very usefull interface, option for custom sorting types and a great support..."
"Fantastic customer support, well thought-out app user interface and very helpful automations. Thank you!"
"We are using Skubana more than a half of a year and Skubana is a great platform to use. The connections and navigation are easy and logical which makes it really efficient to track inventory and orders from all our Sales Channels. (Amazon, Shopify, Walmart, eBay). It supports our 3PL Warehouses via FTP and API connection. The interface is really friendly to users. You do not need any special skills to operate in Skubana. One more important thing is that Skubana is a rather speedy app. Import/export information takes seconds.  Special thanks to the support team that is always there ready to provide with prompt, helpful and qualified response to pretty much any issue."
"Our company just finished on-boarding with Skubana. The interface is straightforward and easy to use. We have over 1,000 products and it's able to handle it. One of the primary benefits is having all of the features needed for an ecommerce system all in one place, instead of using multiple software packages.
Skubana is also very intuitive, so once you understand the logic how things work, the system makes sense. We sell on Amazon, Shopify, Ebay Walmart, etc. and it handles the order processing and shipping for each of these marketplaces. Adding new items is easy and the PO system works well. The Analytics are helpful and bring insight into your business."
"We love the ease and simplicity of using Skubana to automate inventory updates, processing of orders and shipment options from all of our channels. Their customer support and dedication to innovation and continually improve the software and user interface make it a great and reliable software to use, especially for any seller utilizing multiple channels. Easy one-click integration with Shopify and other channels as well as the ability to create bundles and kits makes it second to none. Highly recommended."
I am a beginner user but the interface is easy enough for me to understand and they have help resource pages with instructions. I like how it is easy to set up emails with drag and drop components. It's also nice that it syncs into my product listing so I can pull from there to put products into emails.
The app is working great. Easy to use and intuitive interface. I had an issue that customer support solved very quickly. I recommend.
"It's easy to use, and the interface keeps improving. Superb customer service too. I really like the work they're doing at Handprint!"
"This app allow me to create a B2B section into our website to give the option for retails and sellers to buy direct into our website with their own price list. I've tried many app but this is the one that I found with a easy user interface and with an amazing support team. I've open a lot of tickets and they give me an amazing assistance! So congratulations, really happy to use this app!"
"This application is great and has allowed us to have a B2B interface on our site. Due to the display problems that were apparently related to the wrong settings on our theme, we requested their support. Everything was fixed very quickly, with the help of their developer."
"We have been using this app for almost 2 years now, and we can definitely say that the app delivers everything it promises. In this time, numerous improvements and updates have been published that make this app essential for us. Even though Shopify now has its own pickup function, it is not yet as advanced as the one from Identixweb. Support questions via the widget included in the store backend are answered quickly and even solved - without statements such as ""We'll get back to you"". Another huge plus is that no programming skills are needed to work with this app productively. A cleanly designed admin interface including tooltip descriptions for input fields supports this additionally. We will now also use the shipping option of Order Delivery Date in the near future and extend the review with feedback again."
The apps immediately puts code and a visible interface into all sites right after install your and does not remove it when uninstalled. Messed up my entire shop.
"TLDR: Leaflet lets you use tools that were previously only available to multi-million dollar brands. 100% recommend it.
-- General Overview --
After learning about the large ecommerce companies and the extent at which they did price testing, I knew I needed to figure out how to do price testing in my own store. I looked all over the internet and couldn't find anything. I was contemplating running complex price testing spread sheets and tracking everything myself, but then I came across Leaflet.
Leaflet really made price testing a no brainer. Now, I could manually set prices to test or have Leaflet's system pass me automatic suggestions. Then, I just click a button to test and check back on it a few days later. Super easy.
Leaflet's price testing was directly responsible for a large increase in our margins on our best sellers. We had about a 40% increase in our baseline margins in just about 2-3 weeks.
-- Interface --
One commenter here stated that the interface was slow or buggy for them, but I did not experience that at all.
Now, this is a 5 star review and I love the app, but I am not one to sugar coat. There are things about the interface that could be improved like better representation of pieces of information. The design is pretty baseline and geared towards someone that likes data analysis, which fortunately I do.
That being said, a lot of the suggestions I have made for interface improvement are already in development or being released this week. Also, I am 100% certain if I ever experienced any issues, the team would be right there to help me solve them.
-- Support / Company --
The Leaflet team is small and the app is new, but my experience with them has been great. The best part about working with a smaller team is that they take each and every suggestion/comment seriously. I have made several suggestions that find their way into future updates. I love this because it really feels like my voice is heard and any issue I would ever have would be solved immediately.
I have spoken to Leaflet's team extensively with suggestions and questions on multiple occasions and have always been treated wonderfully. Every question/concern/bug/etc. that I encountered was answered and fixed exceptionally fast (sometimes within hours).
Thanks Richard for your warmth, hospitability, and open-mindedness towards my myriad of suggestions!
-- Summary --
If you are on the fence about installing this app, I highly recommend giving the free demo a try. This may be enough for a smaller store's needs, but if you are a larger store, the $39.99 a month fee is a small price to pay for the wealth of knowledge this app can provide you.
With ONE product test in this app, we increased ONE product's margins by $70 a day, so it's safe to say the app paid for itself.
Another important thing to mention again is that this is a new app with constant updates, new features, and a great support team. If you have any issues or questions, just reach out to them and I'm sure they'll help out."
"Clunky, confusing integration interface with strange navigation and terminology. Warning: every item has to be manually remapped to a Bonanza category (what this app refers to as a profile? why not just call it a category?) and it will only accept TWO variants and NO items with duplicate names. Don't bother. It's a mess and looks like old school PC software. Not user friendly."
This app is quick and easy to use. Fast interface too! We will see how our shoppers behave at this point and see where they are dropping etc. Highly recommended!
"I have just started using the app as of now. So, I don't have much user experience as of now to provide a feedback."
"The team over at Shopkeer Tools have been incredibly helpful in setting up a branded gift card page for me, and I couldn't be more grateful! For one, the turnaround for the branded gift card itself was extremely fast. But what impressed me more was the initiative the team took. Upon noticing that I updated my Shopify theme, Jim went above and beyond and edited the code to the ""To, From, and Message"" fields, so that it looked cleaner and provided a better user experience and user interface. I can't recommend them enough - thank you!"
"Works very smoothly, and has a professional and modern interface. Would recommend! Seeing immediate results..."
"We used this app to create bundles for products, it works great, the overall design is nice, the interface is easy to use and the support team are phenomenal. Would recommend! Keep up the great work!"
"This is a fantastic app! There are other studios out there offering similar interfaces for thousands of dollars. This app does just about everything I could have wanted, and if there's anything that I need customized, the designer is only too happy to help if it's possible. The app lets users add their own text interactively, resize the text, change fonts (you can add as many fonts as you want!), rotate the text, make arched or circular text, change the color of the text, anything you could want. And it's the same with the images. Size them, rotate them, accept transparent background images, you name it, this does it. It even has a flexible custom-pricing interface and a ""cost-counter"" that shows visitor real-time costs of each customization as they add it. I can't recommend this app highly enough!"
"Just so you know, though it says on the app preview that the app is free, it is not. Not sure why I'd have to pay a monthly fee to print or publish my catalog. It should be a one time fee. That alone has turned me off after ALL of the work I put into building my catalog. The interface is slightly user friendly. You really have to play around with it. Wish there were more options for people who have more variants. The line sheets would be great, but they don't show all of the variants that I have available for one product. The titles of the products are cut off as well as the descriptions -  no matter what filter or format I use.The pdf version leaves off information as well so I can't really pass out catalogs at shows or events with half of the information there. It would also be helpful if you could do fliers as well. Oh, and when you hit the ""+"" icon on the interactive catalog, depending on the filter, it chooses some random item from the sheet to give you more information. If you have it in vertical mode, the arrow at the bottom doesn't show everything either. I can deal with all of those things, but the price is a bit much for me. This app could be really great if they implemented these changes, especially for the price that they want to charge. Until then, I have to choose another app or carve time out of my life to make my own from scratch."
"Very easy to use interface and good price/Value app. Accidently deleted some of the config and the support team fixed it for me, free of charge. Unbelievable good service, if you cant get something to work, I am sure the supprort team will sort it out for your ;-)"
"Excellent App. Highly recommend. Codebird's Dev support was very pleasant and quick to respond, helping to get our settings just right. We have had our first sales conversion in the first week of use and we see this App as a valued aid in our customer engagement toolbox. The clean and modern interface and ability to set our brand theme with ease. Quotify was the best out of all the App's offered for custom quoting."
Amazin support. We started with Quotify because of the interface for the customer which just made sense. After a few problems with starting out we were amazed by the support team which have helped us through everything and are always ready to assist us in any way. Would definitely recommend considering the support and improvements Quotify has made for our sales .
"This is the best tool for building a custom online collection using data from your site. It is easy to use, and the interface is very easy to follow. I love how easy it is to start building a new collection, and I only need to keep it running once it's built. This is the best tool for building a custom online collection, and it is absolutely worth the money. https://www.kinkytoy.store https://www.shackled.me"
"I was using another collections app that was giving me some heartburn due to speed and accessible. Tried Custom Collections on a whim and was very pleased with the interface and the speed. On top that, they did a custom tweak for me that made all the difference in keeping my customers aware of what products were available in my collections. Recommended!"
Just installed this widget. Absolutely love it. It was super easy to install and I definitely recommend to anyone looking to enhance the user experience.
So far so good! Super easy to use and setup. Easy to learn user interface. Just what I needed for my Rental Quote Request form!
So happy I stumbled upon this app. Super easy install and building custom contact forms couldn't be easier. A lot of thought went into the app user interface. This app allows you to create different contact forms on different pages. Installing them on that page is as simple as selecting it and clicking install. We have a general contact form and one for wholesale accounts that allows us to create drop downs and buttons. We will eventually be creating one for customers to submit artwork. Well worth the price. I can't speak to support because I have not needed to contact them. Well done designers! Keep it up! Clean easy to use app UI is so important. Thank you.
"Support is amazing and patient. Also, interface is clear, makes syncing with bing merchant center very easy."
"1 Year Update: Now, I'm back on the market looking for another app to suit my needs. I can see why I settled on this one to begin with SOLELY because of the aesthetic of the pop up. Yes, it did convert many sales but that is just the nature of up sell apps, so I will not credit this one for doing its base function. However, this actually made me lose money. How? Because the UI of this is so unnecessarily difficult and unsightly you will dread introducing a new product and opening up this app to cross sell anything. Algebra is easier. Rewiring a space ship is easier. Hell, FACEBOOK ADS IS EASIER. Please!!! Change the user interface.... there is no need for all these sub-rules when creating the main rule. Give us photos or SOMETHING. this is such a headache to look at and makes you want to never use this app.
-
doesnt work unfortunately. the pop up feature shows up when it feels like, and it will not for some reason show up on my product page."
"We use the pop up to gather emails for a discount code and so far it has worked sublimely. The pop up looks smart and clean and the backend interface is great to use.
I recently had to contact support with a few questions regarding integrations with other email marketing apps and the reply was swift, polite and informative. Have since upgraded to the next plan up and would highly recommend this app."
"I highly recommend this app! Gather does exactly what it was designed to do, the interface is very easy and intuitive to navigate, and the developer is incredibly responsive and helpful. Easily 5 out 5 stars... Install it now!"
So far so good. We love the simplicity and the interface. The roll back feature is very valuable for flash sales or sales that need to be rolled back on specific dates.
"It is easy to use, and it helps me build links for my e-Commerce store quickly. The interface is easy to navigate and the backlinks are well-written and user-friendly. I love how easy it is to use this link builder and how my content is always being crawled by the search engines. https://www.kinkytoy.store https://www.shackled.me"
"Really impressed with this app. The installation is super easy and once you get used to the interface it's simple to use. 
I've used a couple of these apps and they all are a bit clunky at times. I found when I was adding or removing products it would always glitch or something. I have not had those issues with this app.
Support was fast too, as I needed some clarifications on the UI and they were quick to respond."
"Great App - Thank you ! Nice and easy interface, I do enjoy the fact that it is free so store owners can see if hat works fro them and not drag themselves in any useless subscriptions"
"This app has been the easiest to set up out of all the product filtering programs I have used. The interface is simple and easy to navigate, but the best part of this app is the ongoing help from the staff. Chris and his team reply extremely quickly and are able to help me with all the design and technical elements that I have asked for help with in a very timely manner. Very impressed with the high level customer service that Sparq provides!"
"So far so good! We carry a lot of different brands of products with different options for the variants, so we needed an app that could filter based on tags. This one works perfectly, and we've had very positive feedback from our team and our customers. The backend setup interface is not immediately intuitive, but I was able to schedule a time to walk through the options with their team and clarify the options. Support has been great from the Sparq team- they are not in my time zone, but if I leave a message during the day they get back to me quickly. They've been super helpful in making small adjustments for me, and overall I'm very happy. Thank you!!"
Too easy to print the wrong label. Ask me how I know. Interface is awkward. Takes time to sync. Defaults to old dates. Doesn't present all shipping options (such as cubic).
"The App has very nice interface and nice features, unfortunately I could not get it to work with my Australia Post eParcel account and the technical support left a lot to be desired. It's a shame because I really wanted this app to work. *************************
UPDATE
*************************
No one by the name of Rodrigo reached out to me with any additional information. I used the same API Key and Secret to integrate my account via another App and it worked immediately, so clearly there is a problem with your app that should be looked at particularly after Matt confirmed that he was also not seeing any rates on my account."
"The app looks fabulous on my store, and the feedback from customers on how it impacts their user experience is great. It is much slicker than I was hoping for, and the support is helpful and responsive too."
"TERRIBLE SERVICE, CRASHES OFTEN AND WON'T VALUE YOU.
I never write bad reviews, only good, especiallyyyy as a business owner myself. I had been with this company for years and come to find out with their ""signature box"" for signature at delivery only has the option for a direct signature and not a simple task to do an indirect signature. This would save us over $5 per shipment. We were using this service for years and overpaying on shipments $5 each time. Can you image the savings we could have passed along to our customers over 6 years and thousands of shipments? The best part is that under their shipping services to ""sell you"" it lists indirect signature. This is something Ship Station and their other competitors offer EASILY, so check those out to save on signature options ;) They informed me that this indirect option is only available through their API system and not web based. This means that you need to have programming experience to do it. I asked if they can do it for me to help (I have been a customer for MANY years) and they informed me they won't and that I can hire someone. Their response: If you have the programming resources, you can certainly setup API for your Shippo account. Are you joking? You can't even help someone who has given you business for many years? Well, now I am moving my business over to ship station since they have this already integrated in their system and all I have to do is click a button and it's done. PS agree with the others your new interface is terrible. They will not value you as a customer or go any extra length to help with a need if you have one."
"Shippo is easy to use, with a clear interface that lets me do bulk shipping quickly. I also like the ability to import files with order info--really useful for club shipments where the product goes out monthly but are billed quarterly. One small but useful feature is that Shippo ties back into my Shopify account and automatically marks shipped orders as fulfilled. For my shipping volume, five cents is an incredible bargain. The only thing I'd like to see is an option to buy carbon offsets. Thanks for a terrific product that makes running my business that much easier!"
This app dramatically improved our functionality and allowed us to have a much better user interface. The development were so responsive and diligent and went above and beyond in meeting our requests. I cant recommend Sparq enough!
"This is probably the best shoppable Instagram and UGC app out there. We tried 2-3 other solutions until we settled for Foursixty. It has a great interface and direct integration with Shopify. The support answers within hours, unlike on other apps. I truly recommend this."
This is the second simprosys app I have used and it works great! The Q&A feature looks good on my produt pages and the user interface is easy to use. Excellent support as well!
"Gatsby has been an incredible asset to the e-commerce side of our business. Their easy-to-use interface has allowed us to create custom and engaging campaigns to increase both sales and social engagement. On top of the stellar interface, the customer service is second to none. Brett has taken amazing care of us every step of the way and we can't thank Gatsby enough for the results they have produced for us! It certainly doesn't hurt that they're always coming out with new functionality that further enhances the value of the app. Give it a go, we promise you won't regret it."
"Gatsby is a great app to develop your micro influencer strategy! It displays a customizable button on your site. Influencers can be incentivized to click and share your brand on social media with their friends and followers, spreading your messaging to the world. The interface is super simple to use and your button is highly customizable to match the look and feel of your site! The Gatsby team is very responsive and open to suggestions, which is great. I highly recommend adding Gatsby to your site and attract more influencers to represent your brand!"
"I really like the interface and i am nearly fully happy! BUT i would like to set the swapping times to something uneven, like 1/3/5/7/9 hours in order to really give every option the same time frames during a day.
If i put my A/B test to swap every 4 hours for example, A would get 8-12 and 16-20 o clock every single day, which would mix up by swapping them every 3 hours. I would love, that you update this feature in the near future and ill happily give you 5 stars Great job guys! Love the update! Cheers :)"
"I've downloaded a handful of social auto-poster apps on Shopify, and nothing compares to this one. A very clean user-friendly interface. You have the ability to post Youtube videos to multiple socials which is a very underrated source of traffic for e-commerce. I love how I can connect multiple stores to one account, and the monthly fee for the upgraded options are very reasonable."
Have been using Onollo for just over a month. What a fantastic time saver. No more manually creating posts for hours each week. Easy to use interface. Fantastic customer service. Everything you need to automate social media marketing.
"If I could give no stars I would.
This app makes me want to kill myself... I have used it for around 18 months and at I chose it because it had the Bold Apps name behind it. 
Well I can safely say that this app is terrible. You need to map each product manually on your store with the entry on Xero because if you don't the app will match your products any which way it likes when you export which will wreak havoc on your stock in Xero and has necessitated us needing to commit close to 90 hours fixing the issues that the app created. 
I got in touch with support to see if they can fix the issue and they were sympathetic but ultimately blamed the original developer of the app and stated that Bold is unlikely to redo the app as this will take ""significant time"". So they are very happy to take my money in the meantime but won't do a thing to improve the app. 
Recently I got in touch with support to see if they can improve the loading of the products for the manual mapping (spoiler, they can't) and they did an export without telling me and it has messed up the mapping of over 80 products. 
Don't even get me started on the manual mapping interface... the search function does not work and I have to scroll through our thousand+ catalogue of SKUs to match the correct product.
Bold... if you are reading this: FIX YOUR APP! REBUILD IT! It is not fit for purpose and it dragging your name through the mud!!!!
Update (11 July): Support are now harassing me and want to reset the mapping so they can ""test"" how the mapping is taking place. Yeah great, then I get to clean up the mess in Xero afterwards. This will only lead to even more of a disaster. They are blaming me because they say that my SKUs are not right on Shopify or Xero or both. There are some variants on Shopify that share SKUs on Xero and there are some SKUs on Xero that are not on Shopify, that is just how business works. I still don't understand why the app can't take this into account/ignore this and just match the SKUs exactly instead of randomly matching them any which way it likes.
Even better: why not let the app take a stab at matching the SKUs on Xero and Shopify and have the customer be able to review it BEFORE they need to export the transactions."
"ease to use and super great app, total FREE great interface and good integration. recommend this app for everyone."
"Excellent free APP. I hope this app will continue to be free!! Simple interface, easy to use, excellent support in some issues that I had. Next step I propose should be Tik Tok."
"It is an excellent application if you need to inform your clients about the process of their order, send automated messages by WhatsApp, it is a very important function if you have clients who contact you by WhatsApp ... ... I paid the $ 20 version for the automatic messages to be sent from our business number, the interface is very practical and easy to configure, I recommend it completely ... ... I also thank the developer for being so professional and kind, I will work for a long time with this company, I hope they continue to grow! :)"
"Goede services word er verleend, Super snelle reacties op vragen via de mail. De app ziet er simpel/clean uit qua interface zonder verwarrende toeters en bellen eromheen."
"This has been the second wholesale app we evaluated for our B2B shop and during all the onboarding process the entire team at BSS has been incredibly professional and responsive. Annie and her technical collegues Duong Hoa, Minh Dang, Dinh Khanh, Leorio and their Business Analyst Riley promptly addressed all our concerns and questions. The app does exactly what promises and the mgmt interface is very well done and the developer has been keen in addressing some critical points related to our specific needs. The app has many feature and we will certainly consider all of them in moving forward with our business."
"I just installed the app. It's doing what it's supposed to do. I love the simple interface.. It keeps all my stats under one roof so i can see what's going on in my FB and web campaigns. Nice!"""
"terrible support, terrible app, no results, perfect audience interface is outdated several years, honestly should be banned from Shopify apps.
After my third attempt to publish campaigns I gave up. Fist attempt, needed to change my campaigns settings, not possible with perfect audience interface, I had to ask for a refund to start over again. Second attemp, the same, needed to change ads, no luck with the 90's interface,  received a refund to start again, the Third attempt:  after 2 days of paying and setting my campaigns, no impressions, no clicks, contacted support and blamed my theme and asked to install a code fix (they never explained where) had to ask for a refund."
"Amazing and well supported app. Fast response through technical support and very responsive, organized interface.
Looking forward to new features."
I had an AWESOME experience with Blutag! The interface was super easy to set up - very user friendly and didn't take a lot of time. Support was excellent with answering any questions I had as well. 10/10 recommend Blutag to get your store Alexa enabled!
Click ship has been super easy to work with. The interface is clear and concise. Any issues are resolved quickly from our amazing account manager Maythum. We msg him and get a response almost immediately. We were working with another 3rd party shipper previously but are really happy we made the switch!
"Great app! Makes shipping easy, smooth and organized. Love having everything in one spot. The user experience is also great and customer service"

Love it! Roy is great and quick to reply. User interface is seamless as well. Prices are great and I love that I can compare against all couriers. Integration to Shopify and Etsy is amazing!!
"WOW! Seriously some amazing shipping rates, we never thought we could offer services like FedEx at affordable rates to our customers. The interface is very user friendly and customer service has been fantastic!"
"We've been thru numerous discounted shipping apps and this is by far the best choice.  Easy store integrations, great prices and super easy interface.  Give it a shot, you will not be disappointed!"
"Without doubt , it is number one in it's category !
Best prices, service, and support.
Nice & friendly use interface.
It will save you money & time 
Love it"
Nice app. Easy to use. Clean interface. It is exactly what I was looking for to display simple popup messages on my site. https://www.delawarebusinessincorporators.com
"This retail barcode app is not as robust and easy to use as we would like. First, let's start with the tags: There is little you can do to edit or alter the printing template. If you have products with variation, you cannot note this in the printing, as it merely prints 3 fields: Price, the main product name, and SKU number. So, for example, if you have similar products that differ by style, you cannot note that difference on the tag. The only difference would be the SKU number - this is not helpful.
Second, the dashboard interface is best suited for simple 1 or 2 product printing, but not if you need to print one set of tags after another. If you need to print another set of tags, you will need to basically restart the app by clicking the ""Retail Barcode Label"" title in the app. It's very annoying that the dashboard view is set up this way - it's not intuitive, and makes the printing process more of a chore.
Third, the app is glitchy. For some reason, the very first tag has a shortened product name, while all subsequent tags have the full name. In short, if you can avoid using this app, go for it. Find something better."
"Great experience with this app. Their support has been great, they've been receptive to suggestions, and the app both calculates a more accurate quote AND provides a slick interface for purchasing labels and fulfilling orders."
Borderline useless. It doesn't have my Dymo label size and doesn't let me use metafields or even a range of Shopify fields. Like many Shopify features it seems to have been designed without much user experience input.
"Freightcom in general is the best shipping solution for small business. Great options and incredible rates. The app makes the whole process of fulfillment simple, quick and error free. Export documents are also the easiest to create in the app or stand alone software. The only feature that is missing in the app is the ability to enter multiple boxes for one order but this can be done in the web interface easily enough."
"A must have app for any Shopify owner! It has the best rates compared to any other app and the interface is very user friendly.   It automates the entire shipping process allowing me to batch print labels, schedule pick-ups, and automatically fulfil orders.  The customer service is fantastic and they are always available for any feedback and respond quickly.    Also, if you ship any skids or pallets, you get access to their very competitive LTL shipping rates. This is hands down the best shipping app I’ve ever used and highly recommend it!"
"GREAT IDEA as Shopify normally does not allow you to perform multiple discounts in its code despite this being an issue for over 4 years (I've read past forum posts about it). Believe me, I've been looking EVERYWHERE for an app that has similar functionality and this is the best around for that.
Pros:
- Multiple discount functionality but it takes time to figure out and you have to test it yourself to make sure all the factors are working. They provide a tutorial video on its features but you still need to figure out things for yourself. I really like how it works because it works great for my niche. This app is really unique compared to most other discount apps.
That's about it, really. This app needs more development. Let me tell you about my MAJOR and minor gripes.
Cons (MAJOR):
- The way it's presented is hideous. It's a standard uneditable popup box that barely lets you customize it in the settings. And when it does -- it has bugs that revert back to its previous look. From what I've experienced so far, I have to go searching in the code for specific parts to change. And that requires some CSS knowledge.
- The line of code in the files. It's all displayed horizontal and just goes on on just a few lines instead of spaced out neatly like most CSS apps on this platform. It's horrible to look at the line of code and I really wish they would space it all down into separate lines if possible. My knowledge of CSS is limited though.
- $14 a month. Sure, they offer a trial but honestly this app needs to be much less considering the bugs and no real customization features involved. It still feels barebones and I have to actually try and develop onto it myself with limited CSS knowledge or ask the devs how to do that. I suggest they make it $5 or so a month at the most until they fixed all the bugs and added more functionality to it. I get that this app is pretty exclusive and different to all the other discount apps and that's great. The discount feature works great and all but it really should have had a way to present it to customers differently (or at least a tutorial on how to edit its code).
- Can't copy over groups. This really irks me. You can copy rules but not groups and you can't drag a copied rule over to another group on the homepage where all the groups are. Please implement this.
Minor Cons:
- (This can be ignored as I contacted them over the wekeend) Respond time. Over 24 hours already... I really want to know the answers to my questions so I can continue working on this app. It's really great for discounts but like i've repeated over and over, the customization is difficult to work with. I want to add my own images and thumbnails. I want to stylize the box to my liking!
- Typos. They didn't double check them and I see them quite frequently here and there. I know a lot of people probably don't care about that but I'm one of those guys that likes to look at a clean text interface.
Suggestions:
-Allow us to copy over groups PLEASE I HATE HAVING TO REMAKE EACH RULE.
-Add a function that allows us to choose collections of products instead of each individually when adding to specific rules.
-Add a function that allows multiple discounts on the same kind of product but not on EVERY product (e.g 2 pillows bogo 20% off one but they get 4 pillows and 20% only applies to just one. Instead it would have to be 20% off 2 since the customer would be getting 4 pillows). As it stands now, there is going to be a cluster of offers to the customer if they have multiple products with deals on their screen and they will have to sort through all of them to find the right one. I don't know about you, but as a customer I wouldn't mind that but it would be a bit tedious. I guess if you notify the customers what they should be looking beforehand it's alright but if you can do this, then that would be great!
-Add functionality to let the app combine deals added into the group by bypassing the tier somehow (e.g a mouse is bogo and a pillow is bogo but default functionality is the mouse or pillow will just be bogo. Instead, make it so that if the customer has both bogo products in their cart, it will take the discount off both).
- Add functionality so that this can work with loyalty point apps or give a tutorial on how to do this. Alternatively, you can implement your own ""Loyalty Points"" feature into this app to give it more depth and sync with the current sale offers this app can provide (e.g you give a rule that gives x points when a customer completes a purchase through this app).
-Add an option to change font so it can match the website.
-Add an option to change the width and height of the popup box.
-Fix typos.
-Add customization for custom images functionality (and show us how to edit the CSS so we can customize it).
-Fix bugs.
-Charge less until this is developed much more.
Can't think of anything more at the moment but I may re-add and update my review later if the devs actually care to read this.
Tabarnapp, notify me if you do read this and please comment on the functions I suggested so that the longest review on this app store doesn't feel like it's been wasted... haha. I wouldn't mind giving you input on my use of the app as I am trying to implement a neat system that this app allows me to do and discount my merchandise. If you could help code the way it works on my site that would be really nice to give me that kind of support as a customer.
Thank you, 
-Will, Memefox Owner
EDIT: Derek, The Tabarnapp CEO, has been great to talk to and I've been feeding him a lot of ideas on how to improve this app as it has so much potential. I haven't seen much development on it at the moment, but hopefully there will be more soon. Bumped my review up to 4 stars. :)"
Great app! The has an Nice and easy interface with true results. Customers really interact. Thank you guys
"Tried every single rewards app available and this one is the best - simple and straightforward. Best of all this has the best interface in my opinion because the dashboard is clean and not cluttered like the other apps available.
I had a few questions and Yayha replied promptly through email, support is fantastic. We are just starting off launching a simple rewards program and this app gets the job done!"
Easy to setup and automatically sends emails asking for reviews and if the review is bad it sends them to you or good it sends them to review sites. Such a great idea to avoid bad reviews and be able to directly interface with customers to alleviate the problem and turn a potentially bad review into a good one.
Great company to work with. Even when I had a problem they got another printed right away. Great interface
Excellent. Works as promised with no problems—easy interface for our customers. We immediately began to get reviews.
"I manage two stores on Shopify and have tried/used many free or paid apps. This is by far the best app I've experienced. They have all the functions for my business needs, and provide necessary flexibility for me to customize different affiliate programs as well as user interface. I only had one small request and the custom service was quick and professional."
"I've been using Printify for about a year for a shop on Etsy. Creating a Shopify storefront is my next step. So far, the app appears to operate just like its web interface. I haven't done a lot with the app in Shopify yet because I am just getting started, but I don't anticipate any different issues beyond the typical POD issues. I appreciate that I'm not going to have to figure out how to use a different interface. And I like that I can chat with Printify support 24/7. That is a much-needed stress reliever in the POD industry. I saw that some have complained about shipping and about stock issues. I don't see that Printify can do anything about it as they are bringing in many different print providers and letting us choose the company we want to use. I like that. And I like being able to review those companies. Gives us a little more control over our business and we don't have to build our own API to have that. I don't even know if I am using that terminology correctly. Ha."
"I just started using this app but the customer service has been absolutely fantastic, they are so quick to respond, help and resolve. The interface is good. Some suppliers are better than others but at least there are many options. I hope they add a few more different types of products and maybe a few more suppliers in different regions."
SIMPLY AMAZING! AWSOME MOCK-UPS AND INTERFACE IS SMOOTH EASY TO NAVIGATE THROUGH. ITS 2 PRINT ON DEMAND SERVICES I USE. THIS BEING THE FIRST.
Excellent app! The best user experience & support I ever came across. I would recommend it to anyone. Simply great.
"EN: Awesome app! - Easy to use - Fast and great support - Friendly Interface
RO: Aplicatia este minunata! - Usor de folosit - Suport rapid si avantajos - Interfata prietenoasa"
"As beta testers for the WinkSprout influencer program, our team has been very happy with the results we've seen. We were able to connect with wonderful new influencers who were perfectly on-brand. Onboarding was easy and the WinkSprout interface is user-friendly and straightforward. The WinkSprout team was helpful and responsive throughout the whole process."
"Being an experienced dropshipper who has owned and sold over 10 stores, this app provides an excellent interface to speed up the process of adding creative product descriptions for new products, and product captions for marketing campaigns. Would highly recommend for any serious e-commerce owner who wants to scale up fast!"
The customer service is very quick and good and it is a useful application. Very feature-rich and beautifully designed interface.
"This application is used to allow customers to choose additional options on the product page.
I've tried many apps, but this is the only one that fits. By tag, type, brand, manufacturer, or even URL, you can assign options to a specific product. Depending on the product or combination, you can use different rules to display options (tags, types, etc.). The user interface is simple and easy to use. You can adjust the product's price based on the options selected by the customer. It is also possible to change the appearance of the block with additional product options. You can use the CSS style window or contact help for anything you can't achieve using the available switches. Customer service is excellent; they assisted me in resolving a problem that other applications had failed to resolve. I can confidently recommend it to everyone!"
"I'm very satisfied with the Booking App and how it integrates with my website. We are a Jewelry Rental Service and this App makes the admin process and the user experience super easy and smooth. There were a few bugs which were quickly fixed by Ayush Kansal and the team. They have been very responsive and helpful all throughout. Honestly, I knew nothing about website building and these guys made it a piece of cake for me. Thank you so very much guys. Looking forward for new and exciting features in the App. Also, I highly recommend this App to everyone who's looking for managing rental/booking services on Shopify."
"It worked well at the beginning, but now every time that I try to access the admin interface, it says ""Session expired"". How to fix it?"
"The app certainly does do the job and is relatively easy to use. However, I cannot give it 5 stars without the ability for users to re-download their files from their account page. Having to direct confused customers to hunt down an email they may or may not have anymore is a poor user experience. That's a glaring problem, and I'll likely need to find another solution for digital products if I can't sort out a way to modify the template myself."
"Great that it allows downloadable content to get up and running quickly, but the interface feels outdated"
Ship Bob does a good job for us. The interface is pretty easy to use and they ship on time. I would recommend them
ShipBob has allowed us to have a fully automated fulfillment service. It has an easy to use interface and they have great customer support.
"This app is very simple and easy to use. It has an extremely clean design and a great interface. It can be customized just right! 
Customer service is great and always there to help, replying fast to each question and solving each problem!
The subscription is a little bit pricey, but as for now I am very happy with it and it was just what I was looking for. A 14-day-trial is a very fair option as it really gives users the right amount of time to get used to the app and clearly see if this is something for them or not. 
I hope it will continue to work great and get upgrades and implementations. Really nothing bad to say about it! THUMBS UP"
This App is Awesome! 30 day Free Trial is amazing! Take advantage of that! We use this app for Google Smart Shopping and Omnivore makes the process SUPER EASY! We love the dashboard and easy user interface. The Support from Fern & Gareth has been outstanding! Total 5 Star App! Do yourself a favour and add Omnivore to your Shopify store.
Great design and intuitive interface. App installed easily and account setup was very quick. Rates look good as well.
Great customer service and amazing user interface. Not that cheap but probably one of the best options out there
Has potential but still a way to go before it meets my needs. Popup is very slow 5+ secs. No mobile specific design and I could not get it to work on mobile. The product selection interface is difficult to use. Support is good but not sure why I had to sign up to slack to get support. price is cheap but I guess you get what you pay for.
"The app service is excellent as the app functionality, interface is completely satisfactory. The support team's assist is really good and helpful."
"Thank you for the great service. With Quickbooks desktop, this was a great interface."
"It has a nice interface and is a step up from the limited Image functions Shopify has built in but the MAIN feature the app is MISSING is the ability to upload/remove images from MULTIPLE products AT ONCE (ie select multiple products and upload the same image to all of them with one click). But I requested the feature so maybe they'll integrate it one day. Also a plus, their Support was very quick to respond to my email."
Really nice app. I had a few problems with it after downloading but I contacted the support team and within a few hours they had already reached back with a solution and got the problem fixed within a day. Communication was good and the app interface is also pretty good. It does take some time to get used to though.
"This is such an excellent app! Exactly what I've been looking for, having tried various image compressing apps on Shopify. Image Optimizer is quick, transparent, user friendly with their nicely organized interface, and great customer support (got an answer to my question the next day - impressive given the time difference!). We sell antiques, art and collectibles, which means that we have thousands of high quality images floating on our website at all times and needing constant optimization. I look forward to continue using Image Optimizer, very happy so far."
"Easy to use interface and exceptional customer service.
Vitali was very patient with us throughout the whole process. Quick replies, informative and super friendly. Albeit having moved to a full SEO service, we highly recommend this app to any user looking to optimise images."
"MCSL has been a lifesaver for our business. The capabilities of the app were exactly what we were looking for and the interface is much more intuitive and user-friendly than other apps that offer similar features. Not only is the app solid, but the customer service is exceptional. They went above and beyond for our business and are always very prompt to respond to our inquiries and assist us with our issues. We're so pleased with our decision and will continue to recommend this app and the team to our network."
"We are migrating from WooCommerce to Shopify and love this App in WooCommerce and now love it in Shopify too. The App provides both front end customer shipping interface and the backend shipping administrative tool. We tried several other good Apps but they only handled the front end or the back end. Our shipping is somewhat complex, The App allowed us to input our product dimensions and customer box sizes and then shows the customer the optimum rates for the shipping methods we are offering (Ground, Next Day Air, etc). The App allowed us to set Signature Services by product. The App also allowed us to set up Shipping Zones by state (our product has to be permitted by state). PluginHives customer service has been exceptional. WooCommerce and Shopify take very different approaches to how they allow their Apps to work so I leaned heavily on PluginHive's customer service as we made the switch."
"Easy interface, helpful instructions and an amazing customer support. They are extremely helpful. Highly recommended!"
"Easy interface, helpful instructions and an amazing customer support. They are extremely helpful. Highly recommended!"
"I love this app! I have tried several and this by far the best. Super easy user interface, very clean and easy-to-understand plans. From speeding up store (with optimized image sizes) to improved SEO, I am already seeing the benefits!"
"I am just getting started so I can't afford a lot of money at this point and I Iooked at a lot of  Email apps before choosing this one.  Many say a free plan is available and then it is only free for a trial period which I think is false advertising.  This one offers a free subscription until you reach a certain number of subscribers which makes a lot more sense to me.  Segundo looked promising but the free plan was very constraining. I had to pay for the freedom to write some of my own text and still, that was very little else I could do. It was clear to me that all the emails would look the same.  So I tried Rare and immediately was invited for a one-on-one onboarding session. Patrick listened to my specific needs and then we went over best practices for email marketing, how to set up two very important types of email automations and now I feel I am ready to get started.  The interface is intuitive, drag and drop (like Squarespace).  Then we set up a follow-up appointment to review the emails I will make and look at ways to optimize the process and get more sales through the integrated analytics.  These consultations are a free service of the onboarding process.  I can't imagine better customer service than that.  They have empowered me to use their product (no coding) and tailor it to my own brand while educating me on what works to create loyal following and sales.  This makes it more like a partnership because they are investing in me so that when my list grows I will be able to afford the paid service when I will need more bells and whistles for my business.  I can add another review as I use the product more but right now I can't say enough about the positive experience I have had."
"Easy Interface. Easy to Use. Very good App, which includes functions that it promised. In 1 hour i optimized very important things that no one could help me with. Even the Shopify Help could not help me."
"I use both their Importer and the Exporter. Mapping data isn't something I've ever done, or am even familiar with. This app does it perfectly.  And the support is probably the best I've ever worked with. They are on top of any emerging issues, very quick and responsive to questions and issues that I have encountered while getting it set up. I also like that they have honed the interface to make it simple yet powerful. It takes some trial and error, but once it's set up, it's very reliable."
"Avoid this app at all cost. They changed interfaces and completely stopped sending my emails (even though the dashboard ""claims"" they were sent), and even cut my access to my store 4 times because they had to ""fix"" a few things without any notifications. 
If your store is brand new maybe this is a good option for you.. but if you got some experience until your belt be prepared for hiccups. 
NOTE: This used to be a 5-star app until they decided to ""update"" their app to a cheaper interface. I stayed with them for 8 months while they tried to ""fix"" my account. They ended up deleting all my templates and even emails. I lost thousands of emails subscribers and money with them. Buyer Beware.."
"I logged in to my dashboard, only to see that the interface had changed. A lot. Naturally I had some questions, so i hit up support. Within less than 5 minutes, Liz answered all my questions and helped me get back on track with creating a new campaign.
Needless to say - Rare's support is outstanding. I couldn't be happier.
Thanks!"
"Holy Rare! This is hands down the best email program we have ever used. We have tried several programs before (Klaviyo being the latest) and we are seeing huge jumps in not only our open rate, but our conversions as well within in days of using Rare. I was lucky enough to meet Taylor from Rare at an event held by our website firm BVAccel in San Diego, I could tell immediately that the team at Rare would be the ones to take us to the next level.  The interface is easy and intuitive, and both Taylor and Dylan could not be more helpful when (if any) questions did arise. Within one week of switching from Klaviyo to Rare we saw a jump from a  15-20% open rate to a 45-50% open rate, not mention the sales that came from that kind of jump. We cannot wait to dig deeper into what Rare really can do for us, it is really exciting to see what the future of email marketing will be with Rare leading the way."
"Great app with excellent support. Interface is great for fast easy template creation.
If your looking at maximising the potential of your customer list Rare is a great choice"
"I have been very pleased with the capabilities of this app. It is so helpful to have customers and prospects in one place with no more need for a third party mailing system such as Mail Chimp or Aweber which required so much manual work to properly communicate with Shopify. Easy to use interface, great stats at my fingertips and excellent support staff - very responsive and thorough."
"Excellent customer service setting up the app for my business, great interface and functionality. Highly recommended"
"Working with Whiplash has been a great experience. The Whiplash back-end has all the technology in place that you need. An intelligent interface, full access to all your data, etc. But to me, the best part of my Whiplash experience so far has been their customer support. In my experiences in the Shopify app world, support is key for making your apps work for you and do the work that you need done. I had tons of up-front questions and the Whiplash support reps have been exceptional. Available and knowledgeable. Exactly what you want when you have that burning question. Highly recommended!!"
Easily the most flexible bundling/kitting app I've come across on Shopify. Interface is very well thought out and the instructions are clear. Support is very helpful and responsive to questions.
"We've been using Whiplash for about 18 months.  They're honest people and have a very clean, user friendly interface that works well with shopify.  I highly recommend them."
Whiplash is a great fulfillment service. They offer really great service at a good price and their application focuses on simplicity and the user experience. Definitely better than doing it yourself and they appear to be the best option out there for Shopify fulfillment.
"Whiplash is awesome. 
It's easy to use, and I've had no problems. I really get the feeling that the staff there set up the business with sincerity and they seem to know exactly what 
a small business like me needs. Use them- it will free you up to do other things- like get more sales, develop products, take a vacation, etc. 
The interface is incredibly easy to use. I have a link to their URL, and I can see at a glance what inventory I have left, which orders are pending, etc. But I never really have to check because they always take care of everything.
I must admit that while I like to emphasize a positive experience in a review- I'd like to save anybody who is reading this review from using Shipwire. Myself and many others refugees have had the terrible experience of using them, and at this point I'm blown away at how much better my experience is. Wow. Had to include that. Thanks for reading and happy fulfillment!"
"I decided to try Whiplash after pulling out most of my hair dealing with another fulfilment company (namely, Shipwire).  It's been a few weeks and, in comparison, I am finding Whiplash like a breath of fresh air.  Their systems and interface are refreshingly straight forward and simple.  And the customer service is quick and friendly.  I highly recommend them."
"We were new to order fulfillment and Whiplash has exceeded all our expectations. Their app works perfectly and their web interface is slick and easy to use. Their shipping is fast and flexible, and their customer support and communication is unbelievable.
These guys are the best."
"Whiplash is an amazing fulfillment company, and their Shopify integration only makes them better! The app is easy to install and allows direct coordination with the Whiplash online interface. Plus, the folks at Whiplash are extremely responsive to anything you need help with! Great app, great company."
"Talking to other fulfillment services felt like talking to a car salesman and a high school teacher. Features were pushed to us whether we wanted them or not and it felt like we had homework to do before we could use their services.
Whiplash is fulfillment done right. The interface is uncluttered and intuitive. It has everything we need, nothing more and nothing less. And customer service is like talking to a buddy that cares."
We've been using Whiplash for over a year and have shipped thousands of orders with them with out issue. Fast and dependable with great customer service and an easy intuitive interface.
The support team is great - very responsive and willing to go out of their way to make customizations to better fit your site and desired user experience. Special thank you to Dmitry and Angelika for their quick service and support!
"I would rate 5 star if only the frontend interface loads a faster. Everything's loaded but customer has to wait 5 more seconds just for the bundle interface to appear. And on Safari, the interface doesn't load and appear at all. I'll change the review once the issue has been resolved."
Very excited for our wholesale clients! This app is super easy to use with an intuitive interface. A job well done Conversion Bear.
"The simple interface and smooth operation, plus the step-by-step guide is worth a try. It is free now, maybe there will be a paid plan later."
"I am all about commending this app as a great app for blogging. The interface is very easy to use. I have tried many different blogging apps and overall, this one is in fact the best. Whenever you install an app, you usually get the email that says, ""Thank you for installing"" and ""If you have any questions..."" and ""Check out our website for more information"". However, with this app developer, they spammed the heck out of me, with 10+ emails about thanking me for installing, and other associated content. I pay for an app to help build my business, but way too much spam and while the developer may want to communicate, excessive emails shows me the developer is a little narcissistic of the app. My recommendation is use this app and it will help your blog, but unsubscribe from their emails as soon as you install it or be warned you will get a ton of spam."
"I was looking for a blog app that was easier and more flexible than the Shopify blog editor. This app is certainly easier to use and if you have any experience with MS Word or Google Docs the interface will be very familiar. It is nothing really fancy but it allows you to easily create blog posts that conform to a standard style and keeps them looking clean and easy to read. My only issues with the app are:
1. The app replaces your main Shopify blog page with a different one which you then link to from your website navigation. This is fine EXCEPT for the fact that this page doesn't show up anywhere in your Shopify page list and therefore you cannot edit it. I wanted to add a banner to this page and was told that there is no way to edit it.
2. The way fonts behave is a little weird at first. I think it pulls fonts from your Shopify theme but for some reason the text looked weird, either way too big as a headline or way too small as paragraph text. I checked my Theme font and these should have been fine so no idea what was happening. I found a workaround which was to set the DropInBlog text to ""preformatted"" and then set the font and size in Google Docs and copy paste it into the blog. This seemed to keep whatever was in Google docs. For the time being it is good enough for what I need it for but I hope the developers add some more functionality in the future."
We have found this app very helpful! Great for the user experience and to make sure our customers products are being delivered to the correct address.
Really nice app interface. It offers a nicer look and feel to standard blog pages. The support are really helpful too.
"Responsive support and
Overall setup and integration with our Shopify site has been smooth. We loved the fast support provided from their team when we needed to migrate from our old system, which took about one day to get everything moved over once we supplied everything that was required.
Design wise - The interface is clean and simple to understand. Easy to onboard my team. They also have some of the best looking widgets and badges. If you’re particular those design elements you’ll be pleased here.
I hope in the future that there is an intermediate step before the review form is automatically sent, A simple thumbs up or thumbs down regarding the overall product/service should be sent first before the full review form link is sent."
"Definitely one of my best purchases!
I am really impressed by this cool tool, which will certainly boost your SEO. It offers a very clean user interface and a statistics dashboard with several widgets. More important are the SEO boost dictionaries which are unique among the available consumer reviews tools.
Furthermore, they keep their promises! I bought it through AppSumo and since their first offer there I seee a great progress, they are constantly improving it .This is definitely worth buying! Don’t miss this opportunity."
"Excellent App for eCommerce
I didn't have the time to collect feedback from my customers and do everything else that I need to do as a business owner. Trustmate's simple and easy-to-use interface looks really promising. Review software is a must for any company looking to increase their online presence and have a clear path to success. If you have the opportunity, I would recommend getting on board with them as soon as possible!"
"You can write blog posts, and they look okay when you post them. They have three layouts to choose from for the blog listing page (2 of them are terrible). They try their best to offer a decent onboarding experience(it's not good, though). My biggest issue is the price. $50/month is an insult for the tiny feature-set it offers. The SEO features are a gimmick that don't work properly and have questionable value. The actual experience of writing a blog post is terrible. You have no way to customize the appearance or layout of your blog posts. The actual blog creation interface is a run-of-the-mill editor they copied and pasted from some open-source platform. It's a real hassle to use."
Great app really helped me in writing my blog posts. Easy and simple interface and great options for social sharing!
I use it to make quick product videos that may not have one and also like the interface it's easy to understand.
"EDIT - After an original bad experience with the app, Ankit messaged me and offered to resolve the issue for my shop directly.  He got it working within a couple of hours, and seems to be good for now. Will update here if necessary. The interface is very easy to work with, appreciate the option for ""common"" images, so don't have to select for every variant. so 5 stars on that. Very quick and friendly support. If it continues to work as described, I will be very happy, and will upgrade to 5 stars review.  The reason for 4 stars is for the original bad experience of the app malfunctioning and deleting my original variant images on first test product.  I suggest installing with a TEST product, confirming that it works (or getting support to get it to function properly) before rolling out to all products in case of an error.  5 stars for quick and friendly support. 
-----ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW, was resolved by support----
BEWARE this app, it removes your set variant images from products, so if you uninstall the app, none of your products that you have set up will have any variant images set, so you will have to reset them all manually for every product that you previously set up using the Clever Variant Images app.  Easier to use interface than Free Variant Images app, but not worth even ""testing"" this app as you'll lose any preset variant images you had... The only reason for the 2 stars is that the interface is easy to work with, but just everyone beware, you will be locked in to the app, as changing your mind will DELETE any preset variants on your store."
"I've gone from GREAT :) to POOR :( & now back to GREAT again!!
I'm going to leave my previous comments below so that I'm sharing my honest experience. But I would like to thank Eric for contacting me so quickly by phone and working tirelessly over the course of a single day to get everything fixed for me. My site is working perfectly. The checkout conflict is resolved. The bundles are formatted beautifully. I think we've finally cracked it. Regardless of my issues with this app, I can't fault the team. They genuinely seem to care. They want to get it right. I'm confident that this is the app for me going forward. Thanks guys, let's hope we've resolved everything. 
THE NEGATIVE
I wish I had taken more notice of the negative reviews :( At first this app seemed like a dream (see my original review below) but it's absolutely messed up my store & customer services have stopped responding to me to sort it out. I'm using the prestige theme & when customers go to checkout the prices of my products simply don't match what they're seeing in their cart. Everything is jumbled up & a complete mess.  I was told this would take a day or two to fix. Two weeks on .. not only am I still getting daily complaints from customers about the checkout mess, the bundles I'd put together for a Christmas offer this weekend are formatted so badly with text overlapping, images not showing and chunks of the website missing. It's completely screwed up my store. I was told my ticket was a 'high priority' I'd hate to see low priority if a fortnight later it's actually worse! The Bold team sent me an email a week ago telling me everything was fixed. I replied to say it absolutely wasn't. No response from them since. I contacted the Prestige development team to see if they could assist and before I'd even mentioned the app by name they asked if it was a Bold app I was having trouble with. STAY AWAY if you value your customers. This app causes nothing but grief and hassle. Now I've got the nightmare of trying to get it removed to restore everything back to normal. Wish I'd listened to the negative reviews.  
ORIGINAL REVIEW (I should have waited longer to test it fully!)
So, here's what I wanted ... an app that not only bundled my products together, but also drew down on stock from my existing inventory. So that I didn't have to physically pre-assemble a certain percentage of my stock. At first I wasn't sure whether it was something this app could do. It wasn't immediately obvious. So I reached out to Mayank on Live Chat who quickly explained it's in the premium version (also a free trial) It worked brilliantly! For some reason today (Black Friday) some of my bundles weren't working quite right, so I reached out again on the Live Chat. The team answered within seconds, looked at the back end data for me and explained it's because I need to disable my 'Buy it Now' button. They helped me do that and it's running brilliantly! This app achieved everything I was looking for and todays support - especially from Art, Jonathan & Simran has been fantastic! Excited to keep trialling different bundles out for customers through one simple interface."
"UPDATE: I tried this app again because I believe in its capabilities, but I was disappointed again. The app rounded my bundle prices down for each item causing huge losses. I contacted support two weeks ago, and they still haven't resolved the issue. I would give zero stars if i could. These guys are going downhill fast.
UPDATE: This app has really gone downhill. The cart is glitchy, and the interface has so many bugs, that users aren't able to add bundle incentives. It's too bad because this is the only thing I can find that meets the need of discounting items automatically without using discount codes. This app is super easy to setup and create bundles! It's great for those that want to do quick bundles or sales! There are two possible kinks with the app. 1) it doesn't always automatically sync new items in a category for collection bundles. 2) we suspect and inventory count issue with the software that we are trying to identify. Sukh, has been great so far with helping us resolve the bundle update issue."
Wonderful app! Simple and very easy to use. Straightforward interface and instructions. Definitely check this app out!
If it was functional with the new Shopify 2.0 interface. I would have given 5 stars. I hope it comes soon! Until then we have to use something else that is easier to build with.
"User friendly interface, great customer service, looking to get it set up with a few other brands in our company. Very great!"
"Klarna cancelled over $3000 in orders without notifying us. We went ahead and shipped the orders, and THEN Klarna notified us that there was an error.  Their interface is not fully integrated with Shopify, so Shopify doesn't update if they cancel your payment. They didn't notify us by email either.
We're out thousands in losses and Krystan from customer support says ""it's in the contract"" and refused to help us recapture the orders. We can never recommend this faulty app and horrible customer service."
"Hands down this is the Wishlist App! The support folks and developers have been very responsive to my needs. It's feature packed, highly customizable, very lightweight (quick), easy to let customers share their list, excellent Admin interface within Shopify, AND it is the most affordable wishlist app ever.
I own two stores, retail and wholesale. My retail theme already had a built-in connection to another app for wishlisting so I used that one. I needed one for my wholesale site and after some good research decide this was the one I wanted to try. After the initial purchase and install things were not quite set up and connected as they should have been. I knew I had followed all the great helpful support docs but it just was not working. I reached out to support and in less than 12 hours they completely resolved the issue.
I'm going to ditch the wishlist on the retail store and implement Smart Wishlist on there as well. Excited because I'll be able to make better use of the wishlist sharing, and let users save items without login. Two features I decided not to use for my wholesale customers.
We all know the price in speed that is paid for each app, script, and connection that has to get called up from a third-party provider when our store pages load.  Webmarked does a really great job at streamlining their app. I haven't noticed any slow-down.
Kudos to Webmarked! Thanks for developing an awesome app. Hurrah!"
"We chose this app for our client because it stores the variant chosen by the customer. We received good support when we wanted to customize the look of the wishlist page. Room for improvement: The admin interface with the app could be sleeker and speeding up load time of wishlist page would be great.
- Chris & Andy Design"
Excellent app! Simple interface and a small amount of code to install. Works great! The support team is wonderful too and very responsive. We made some minor customizations to our cart page and the Local Delivery team helped us get the cart page working better.
"So I started using JetPrint a few months ago because they offer products such as denim jackets, high-top shoes, dresses, etc) not available at other POD services (Printify, Artsadd, Printful, etc.). Any issue I had was quickly responded to and resolved. My first few orders were during the Christmas holidays and JetPrint did amazing. Products are great and I can't wait to see what JetPrint introduces next. The interface for designing products takes some getting used to but is very accurate to the finished result. Thanks, JetPrint for your customer service and products."
"I've now put through around 250 orders now (primarily shoes) with JetPrint and overall and pretty happy with them. A couple of little things could be fixed to make it a 5 out of 5 review. The good:
- Product quality has been good and have had no refunds/returns due to poor print or production. My experience with other POD providers is I would typically sit at a little under 1% error rate due to poor production/quality. So to have 250 go through and have no issues is a good start. - Design interface/mockups - I'm pretty happy with what is offered and its easy to use with nice mockups. I actually find their shoe mockups the best by far (I've used almost all of them over the last few years - Pillow Profits, interest print, artsadd etc) - Support - overall good. The reply promptly, and when problems arise they are usually solved quite quickly. There has been the odd occasion where I did not get a reply for 48-72 hours and in these instances I would rather they say ""its going to be late"", or ""i have not heard back yet"" than giving radio silence and no updates. - Pricing - is great. Best I have found by far and quality is the same as other POD shoe providers. - Shipping - They mainly use YunExpress for international segment, then local carriers for last mile. I've been average 20-22 days to the US/UK/Canada from date of order to date of delivery (so includes production and shipping times) which has been great. My only issue is some of the last mile carriers (eg OnTrac) often let the team down and I have had a few ""wrong address, return to sender"" when the address was not incorrect at all. Only seems to happen with OnTrac (and I've since read some pretty concerning things about OnTrac) . On the upside, JetPrint did replace all affected orders and upgraded to Express shipping (I was VERY impressed with this especially as I had offered to pay for the express shipping). The Bad (well not, bad, but could be improved):
- Dashboard - a bit clunky to use. Does not allow you to search by your store order #, or the customer name so to locate an order can be challenging. They use an internal order # (eg O_211208_00036) which does not reference Your shopify order #1234. The Customer name is also shown only as the first name....twice. So if an order was for Greg Smith, it will show as ""Greg Greg"".. So with no order number or full name to search by it is really hard to locate orders. - Shoe sizes: dimensions of shoes are provided but only show as an external measurement when what is required is the internal measurement. There is a great guide showing how to measure your foot length, but then you cannot look that measurement up on their charts as it only shows an external measurement (rather than the insole measurement). The work around was to buy a several pairs of shoes and do internal measurements myself. I raised this when I first installed the app (Sept 2021) and it has still not been resolved. Summary: The no order number/""firstname firstname"" issues is my biggest gripe at present. I would not be turned off the app by this though, but it can make a 5 second job take 5 mins. This doesn't sound like much but when your at scale, it adds a lot of time to the day. I think it's also critical they get those insole measurements of their shoes as having the external only is meaningless to the customer. If these items were fixed, it would be a 5 star app."
Professional Team and great new interface work/app....... Really awesome ! and quick shipping time.
"Professional app....... Really worth trying
Excellent interface, variety designs to choose from and quick shipping time."
"Unbeatable selection. On the pulse with respect to user-interface design & experience, print design tools, & overall navigation & product offerings. Exceptional application."
Exceptional customer service and quality print of demand provider. JetPrint has a really great range of unique products with a very easy to use interface. JetPrint is perfect for new business owners looking to start and established business looking to grow and expand. As an experienced print on demand user I'm excited by what JetPrint has to offer and look forward to driving more sales through their platform over the near term.
"nice app very complete, help build trust and give my store credibility and interface, thank you."
With unique products and intuitive interface make this an interesting addition to our brand's arsenal.
I just install the app and I'm loving it. Its easy and intuitive to create offers. Clear interface and awesome support in case you have some specific needs.
"Incredible app. Perfectly implements the native checkout upsell functionality of Shopify, with an easy-to-use interface. You'll see results from day 1. Big thanks to the developer for releasing such an awesome app."
Application très facile d'utilisation. Belle interface et possibilité de mise en page très appréciable
I should have wrote this review sooner but I kept waiting to find something wrong with the app.   We have tried nearly a dozen different shipping apps and all of them seem to have something broken.   If staff print labels from home then most shipping software blocks USPS pickups unless the return address shows our staff's home address.  Ordercup gets this right by allowing you to choose the USPS address to pickup from while putting a different address on the label.   The interface is easy to use and you can print most labels in 2 clicks.   The labels always work and the packing slip looks nice.   The pricing is free for anything less than 50 packages a month.   The support staff is simply amazing too.   If you haven't tried Ordercup yet then definitely try them out.  It's hands down the best business shipping solution we have found.
"Order Cup does it all for my business' shipping needs. Easy to use, excellent interface and first class support. You won't go wrong using this amazing app."
"Fantastic app, beautiful interface. Excellent customer support, best I have received from any app developer from the last 5 years running our business. MUST HAVE for all Shopify Websites. HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
Neat clean app with good user interface. I like the flexibility to edit invoice details just before export. Team has been responsive too.
easy to use interface and i can choose specific products to attach it to instead of the whole page.
"This is a great little app. It really help wirth giving our customers the opportunity to buytyhrough the marketplace. I wish they had a bulk interface, is the only issue"
"Easy-to-use interface, helpful auto-translation tools and very friendly support. I highly recommend this app !"
"J'ai utilisé cette application afin de traduire l'interface d'un site Internet. Très bonne prise en main, et en cas de soucis rencontrés l'assistance est réactive.
Je recommande vivement !"
I've used this app for over a year now and love it! Super basic interface but great to use. My vendors also love using it. Very simple to keep track of orders on their dashboards and update tracking. Syncing is 10/10 as well as the customer support team. Thanks for the great app!
"What a great user experience! So simple and quick to setup, and working really well. I really like the incident timeline feature. Good job"
"Great, intuitive interface, easy installation, everything works perfectly. Highly recommend this add-on!"
"We use the GiftShip app on our Cart, as well as their ""big brother"" Wholster app. Both are fantastic for split-shipping an order, and are well designed for user experience. GiftShip works well for ""self-serve"" customers to fulfill an order to ship to multiple addresses; Wholster is great for larger split-ship orders, or B2B customers who need invoicing options.
The Support team is helpful, responsive, and quick to find solutions when there are small bugs or hiccups."
"The app is amazing, easy to use and has the same interface as Shopify admin. Support was great help in ironing out the small issues for configuring the app. Well done!"
"Restockify is THE BEST Back In Stock Alert app for Shopify! Great functionality, a simple to use interface, & outstanding customer service!"
"I am super impressed with the customer support from the Giftship team!! I needed some help getting the app set up with my theme, and they jumped right in and took care of it. They even went the extra step of looking at how I had things configured and suggesting a change for a better user experience. We just started using the app, but in my testing it seems quite user-friendly and intuitive. I think customers will find the same."
Helps me export data i wasn't getting out of shopify. Interface is fairly straightforward/ only thing that would be helpful to get you going faster is a data dictionary that explains what each field is in a bit more depth but i still figured it out.
"This was an awesome resource to use as my pledge manager for my kickstarter campaign for a handful of reasons: 
1. Very reasonable price
2. Great customer support
3. I got to direct traffic to my website instead of a third party website
4. Visually pleasing
5. Intuitive interface with easy instructions
Highly recommend."
I used crowd control for my latest Kickstarter and am very happy that I did. We generated nearly 40k in extra revenue on a 260k kickstarter and so far we've had no issues with any backers. The user interface is intuitive and it allows a lot of flexibility for the unique pledges that always occur when doing crowdfunding campaigns. It's easy to create upsell friendly checkouts and it's so nice to have all of your orders on shopify so you can fulfill from there versus another platform. Highly recommend!
"I used this app for 3 Kickstarters for my brand KLOS Guitars and am very happy with how everything went. The biggest benefit is having your backers on your shopify site so you can fulfill from there. The other great benefit is that it's very easy to create a collection and user interface that facilitates upselling. Using this app has helped us upsell over 20% at times, generating tens of thousands in extra revenue. Highly recommend over other similar services like Backerkit or CrowdOx!"
"Can't say enough great things bout Gift Wrap Plus.  Soner Biricik and the other folks at Nulls.net are great to work with.  
In a period of 24 hours they worked on fine tuning our site to work exactly the way we wanted it to.  Their response time is within minutes of reaching out to them.  We had some ""special"" circumstances with integrating our gift wrapping products and they came to the rescue, writing additional code to accommodate a user friendly interface for our customers.  
This is a great product out of the box but the real testament is the personal attention we received from their support staff.  
Big Thanks from all of here at Puppy Culture!"
"Do not attempt to use this app if:
• your store name uses an ampersand (&) because Microsoft Advertising won’t allow you to use it.
• you sell products that require you to use an estimated sign (℮) in the product variants because MA doesn't understand what it is. I had a horrible user experience attempting to set up my MA account, so I followed their links to submit feedback. My email was returned to me because their IT would only allow individuals within Microsoft to use the email alias publicly displayed. I tried using another link to give feedback and that returned a 404 page. I am still trying to delete my account but their help pages are out of date. I am going to require the use of a support specialist because the site won’t give me a clear way to delete my account. I wasted a lot of time trying to get this tool to work for my business. I would not recommend this app."
"What I know the app purpose is to connect your Shopify products to Shoppe, Lazada & Youbeli (PrestoMall is integrating soon).
So far I love the clean interface, simple & easy to go through the setup sync. No transparency and everything function smoothly.
Josh from the support team was fast to aids my problem regrading the things I am uncertain. There are times if he is not familiar with the internal system error msg of the app he is willing to reach out to the development team on behalf of my concern. There support team are honest and hard workers.
The reason I give four star is because the app can't sync further with the product tab description as the tab description is created by a different app developer. Their app solely exist in shopify interface settings only.
Overall great app and support team"
"This app is honestly amazing. I am floored by how much it does, how nice the layout of the interface is, and how much time it saves. Definitely would highly recommend trying it out."
"- Poor user experience. - Horrendous product mockups
- You are not able to tell if the products you are printing on are good quality, as they don't have any photos of the products. - Nowhere near as intuitive to use as other apps I tried out this app last year, VERY sad to see they have not bothered to improve the quality of their service."
"I use both ""Bulk Image Edit"" and ""Bulk Product Edit"" very regularly. Excellent user interface and very easy to do what I need to do. If you want to resize bulk images, apply new alt text or any number of other things you absolutely need to do to your product images en masse then you absolutely will need this app."
"Y'all, download this app. Although I'm a relatively new ARTHOUSE_STREETFASHION startup, I've experimented with every POD / AOP vendor available; I've worked with manufacturers & printers directly. This is the supreme app for a few reasons. 1. Seamless design tool that works with surgical precision. 2. Product variety.
3. Overall interface design. Hands down leading the pack."
The app interface is as same as shopify which makes it very easy to use. And the support is the very best. Better than wish support!
"Very easy-to-navigate interface, and a wide variety of products available to offer your customers. And super-fast shipping! My best experience so far of the many POD suppliers that are out there."
"Easy to import products. Easy interface. Great customer service, I feel supported. Hopefully it brings sales"
"I'm really happy that we chose this app to sale our products on Wish marketplace. The setup is very easy, and the interface is user-friendly. Importing and uploading products in bulk is a huge TIME SAVER! The support is top-notch, always available to answer any question through Skype or WhatsApp. Swati, from the support team has always been available from the day we subscribed to the day we got our first order. And whenever, we face an issue, they're always here to help. I highly recommend this app, we've tried many for our store, and this is the best so far."
Their interface has been really easy and great to use. One of the best application in this app store. Chat support has been top-notch. Swati has been superb in the support and she's there to clarify everything you need.
"While we've only recently installed this app, I wanted to share our preliminary review since the support (by Kundan), functionality, and user interface to match the look-and-feel of The X Shop (www.thexshop.xyz) is aMaZiNg!! In addition, our change requests are completed in a timely manner and the price is so affordable! It can be challenging to find the right app that balances the user requirements with the business requirements at a reasonable price for a startup and so we really appreciate that this app is perfect for this! I highly recommend this app, including the support provided! I will post another review after we've had more time to use it, in particular the backend functionality to review data and obtain insights. Good luck everyone!"
I used the app to setup daily deals. The interface was really easy to use and setup. Can be use also for liquidation
"Lifetimely is fantastic, saves me hours in excel & looker building pivot tables to analyze cohorts, and brings it into fast loading web interface that even my CEO likes using."
"Incredibly insightful and great user interface. This app has highlighted various needs and opportunities our business has - for that, we are very grateful Karri & Team!"
This app was recommended to us by the agency which set up our store. It has jobs that are easy to manage either automated or manually with a simple interface and easy to use + they have great support!
Really a great way to mark our orders as fulfilled and trigger the shipping confirmation email to customers. It interfaces very well with the FTP server of our logistics partner.
This app packs some serious data crunching abilities. Very visual interface to understand your clients purchasing behaviour. A total must if you are trying to optimise your CAC and ROI. A+
"Great app, does exactly what it says. Easy to set up subscription plans of all sorts, all smooth. Great managing interface with several options. We used it with Narrative theme first then attempted to install on another premium theme however the installation was not as smooth as with Narrative so reached to their customer service team and I received the BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE in ages. Sergey who installed and integrated the app on the new theme was super quick (it took around 20-30 minutes all together with me explaining what the matter was). Extremely happy with it. Highly recommend if you are after an app for recurring payments/ subscriptions!"
"This app is essential to store, I use it to list customized options for different products, simple to use and very smooth user interface"
"Hello everyone, if you are looking for a currency converter for your store look no further. I know that there are many other alternatives to this app which provide more or less the same features but trust me, do not spend any more time deciding which app to use as this app is by far the best currency converter app. The user interface of this app is also way more user friendly and takes less than a minute to set up. The developer of this app is also very friendly and responds to requests for help very quickly."
"best upsell app on the market. The interface is easy to use and looks good on my store. Support is quick and helpful, Definitely recommended"
The app helps a great deal with user experience. I'm looking forward to more free better features in the future.
"We switched to Monk's upsell app after using several others, and it's the best that I've seen thus far for Shopify. Really amazing user interface, more options than the others, and stellar customer support. Will be recommending this app to everyone I know who uses Shopify!"
I found out about Zeno through a friend's recommendation. It is quite simple to understand and it features a very easy to use drag and drop interface. The support is very professional. They are quick to respond and answer anything.
"We´ve been using liveSearch for a couple of months now and are very satisfied with its interface, performance and the support-team. definitely recommended."
"Very pleased with this app so far. It has a nice clean interface, easy to get started and use for daily basis. Also impressed with the support. I had some glitches and they help me out quickly."
"The app has many settings to tweak the page the way you want. So far I love the interface, really easy to understand and navigate."
"Tried Pagefly, Shogun before, but I think Zeno is far better. It is simpler, the interface is beautiful and clean, I can get to use it quickly."
"Love this app! So far it is great to build store. I like so much the user interface, really easy to navigate and customise."
Before I even installed the app the customer service from the team was incredible! They assisted in providing full details and exploring the best result for our website. Once installed it's been a seamless integration and improved user experience instantly. Highly recommend!
The app is suitable for setting up different pricing in different countries. The interface is very user friendly. The support from Arpan was great and he was very responsive and helpful. I highly recommend the app.
"This app is suitable for setting up different pricing in different countries, while the interface is user friendly. The support is responsive to any questions. They also arrange a quick briefing to describe the app. I will recommend it."
"Install this with every confidence - it's high speed, bug free, customisable with reporting tools & comes with BRILLIANT support from the developer.
This search app gives multiple results (selectable upto 10) as you type, opening up your inventory to browsing customers.
Look at the price - this is fantastic value, the interface is very professional and soon reveals how inadequate the basic shopify search is. If you are serious about your shop you really should choose this."
"This has got to be one of the best values out there. For $ 3.99 / month we are getting a very sensible and practical app which makes the website look more sophisticated and definitely enhances user experience, and, consequently, conversions.
What's even better is the incredible customer service. All our questions and tweak requests (color changes, font changes, etc.) were answered by Graham by e-mail within hours, with very clear and easy to apply instructions. It's no exaggeration that we've never seen such conscientious service.  (And no, we are not getting any kickbacks for all this praise ...).
Highly recommended."
Best supplier of coffee products on Shopify. Easy to use interface. Great selection of products customers actually want to buy.
"It is a very easy and useful app with a clean interface, making the checkout process so much easier for my store! Customer service is also very helpful. I'm very happy about this app."
"Jon, Bill and Amanda at Jetti have been an integral part of Retail Czar since our inception. We simply could not have the multi-vendor drop ship marketplace without the integration of Jetti. This dynamic platform allows for a seamless interface with fulfillment and inventory automation. Quite simply, Jetti is by far one of the most enhanced and intuitive platforms in the market. Not to mention what a pleasure it is to work with the Jetti team. This team has gone over and above for troubleshooting, customer service and adding new, creative ideas for eCommerce. The Jetti platform allows Retail Czar to remain nimble and allows us to act fast to deliver not only a best-in-class journey for a vendor partner but for a most important, customer experience."
"Update: February 3, 2022: Jetti has come a long way in the last year. They now have a dedicated support team that is able to respond to requests the same or next business day. The ability to publish more than 50 products has been implemented, as has the option to send vendor payments via PayPal with just their email address. It's a pretty powerful platform and, like most powerful platforms, there's a learning curve and it's not always intuitive. The error messages you get don't tell you how to fix the error, so reliance on support is often mandatory. I believe they could benefit greatly from a technical communicator to better their documentation. I also believe that it will be an uphill battle to keep up with the updates of every platform with which they integrate. And an investment in the UI could go a long way. But, these are just some of the trade-offs that are currently necessary to have a MVM that integrates with this many platforms, syncs both ways, and automates payments. My advice for users is to only take this on if you have the resources to dedicate to the setup and maintenance of your MVM on this platform. It's not at all a set-it-and-forget-it app if the price point didn't show you that already. UPDATE March 30, 2021: After this review, I had a call with the developers, which was appreciated. They apologized, explained that they've grown faster than they could handle, and promised to do better while allowing me free app access until I'm fully set up, which I appreciate. So, I have yet to cut my losses and I'm still using the app. Two months after, I still have 30+ day support tickets. There's inconsistent information from different team members, and I never know who will reply to my requests, or when. The help I'm requesting is mostly for accomplishing tasks that their interface ideally would allow without assistance from the support team. 3 things, specifically: 1. Products with variants come in as individual products rather than products with variants, even when pulling from Shopify. This is a nightmare if you don't have them configure it for you before you publish. 2. Pushing all products at one time. Currently, you have to select each variant/product individually, or you can select all products/variants on a page. The option to ""select all"" isn't there, and if a vendor has thousands of products/variants, you still have to publish them 50 at a time. 3. Setting published products to draft, or to publish only on selected sales channels. I have a brick-and-mortar store, and the default setting is to publish these products on POS only, which is literally the only place they are not available. I did finally get my payment situation resolved, but this was because of the support I received from Stripe, not Jetti. Jetti's original recommendation for payment processing isn't located in the US, and the fees made the dropshipping business model unfeasible. I learned this the hard way, unfortunately. Jetti connects Shopify to a variety of different platforms, including smaller ones like Etsy. I found this appealing. However, as platforms update their interfaces and permissions, Jetti struggles to keep up. Better, more updated documentation for all of the integrated platforms, including payment processors, is needed. Original review:
I don't understand all of the 5-star reviews here. I'm very disappointed in the time and money I've spent with Jetti. After four months and $2000 in app fees, I'm still trying to get basic support for setup to help get my vendors paid. I chose Jetti because even though it's the most expensive option for MVM, it seemed to have the most features, and their sales team promised amazing support. However, the user interface is clunky, the help documents are not helpful, and the support team is slow to respond, at best. After countless broken promises from Jetti, I'm looking to cut my losses and begin searching for other MVM options. Buyer beware."
"This is the best I could find!!! The interface is understandable even for dummies like me, and the support gives me sincere respect for its speed and completeness! And what is equally important is that it is not the car that answers you, but a living person, a polite and cultural living person!!! I am absolutely delighted!"
This application is very easy to use and intuitive! The interface is very smooth and support was so fast to respond. Hope to see SEO optimization results soon :)
"This app was the cornerstone of our old layout, and is so vital that we redesigned our store around it. 
Its great to use from a user perspective, everything laid out clearly and flows nicely to create a unique and enjoyable end-user experience. In the back end, from a store-owner's perspective, setting up a product to be used in the app is so easy a child could do it. The end result is great for both customers and shop owners, and is sure to convert casual viewers uploading their design 'just to get an idea' into paying customers with its visuals and ease of use. 
The real gem here though is the customer service, SolverCircle go above and beyond what is required in order to help their customers in a friendly and quick manner that solves the problem overtime. 
We tried a lot of different T-Shirt customisation apps on Shopify, and this is definitely the best of the bunch, especially when its so affordable. 
Great Work!"
Very cool App ! A very good UX interface to jump very quickly from one product to another one ! Developer is very cool and working hard to increase his product every day. Install it and test it !
"Our company has decided to switch fulfillment centers and Fulfillrite was our next logical choice based on the features list we identified as a) a must b) nice to have.
Creation of the account was very simple and the web interface is very nice… You can basically drill down to any detail of the order, inventory shipment -  a lot of options.
Connecting with shopify was a breeze – install it and ask your account manager on the fulfillrite side to activate it and you are in business.
Customer service is very friendly and has fast response time.
5 Stars – Excellent customer service, great web interface,  detail oriented customer service.

I had such a silly question - and they took the time to respond quickly and patiently and help me understand how to use this app. Easiest user interface and the most amazing customer service = perfect for any business owner. Thank you so much :)
"Great app, very clean interface and easy to set up and use. Really above and beyond the original shopify search."
"best bulk discount app. Simple interface, easy installation. I tried atleast 4 other apps before this one and they don’t compare."
"This app and the app developers are amazing!!! They answered all questions we had within hours! Customer service is top notch and the platform is easy to use with great features that other apps do not offer. The one thing we like most is being able to manually input affiliates for all our influencers, make custom codes, and be able to do payouts via products! Not to mention the constant updates and additional features they make regularly to the app for better user experience. We are excited to elevate our reach and sales with Shop Share Paid."
"User Experience is one of the most important things to keep your customers engaged. This tool literally offers everything you could possibly think off in regards to user experience. I am just starting out so I am on the Lite formula. What I look most forward to is the feature of smart collections.
But, I tell you, you couldn't be at a better place here with Findify, another plan for every phase of growth and scaling.
Thank you so much !"
"This app was easy to install and was up and running with just a few clicks. Excellent at improving the user experience and increasing the stickiness of my site and the potential for more conversions. Highly recommended!

"BEST EBAY IMPORT APP & BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE! The app may appear bare bones but after testing other more expensive apps I can say this one works the best and has amazing support. Don't waste money on other apps, they may have a fancy interface but this one works the best."
"This app is one of the bases of our online shop. It's easy to use, the user interface is simple, intuitive. We absolutely recommend it, this is the best eBay importer out there."
"Purchased this to replace a previous Ebay sync app. This is far superior, easy to understand interface and works seamlessly. We had a request to import our Ebay shop categories into the Shopify product tags, that we use for our Shopify collections. The developer did this within hours of contacting. Great support. 5 stars"
"So far, it works great! Sad that Shopify wouldn't let me utilize more than one discount at a time, found this app and tried it out. Does everything I need it to do. Clean and easy to use interface."
"Kit Karts, and Kit, and Ping (the suite of products) cracks the code for social media marketing managers who aren't social media experts, by providing a simple ""friendly"" user interface that handles, or offers to handle, important chores such as following up on abandoned carts (in the case of Kit Kart) or presenting for yes/no decision opportunities to place ads on FB or IG or via email.  I think these apps are of good and demonstrable value especially compared to the cost of hiring someone to handle any of this stuff."
"Using this app improved out results by a lot!! Highly recommended - friendly user interface and easy to use. The service could not be better - the customer success person we worked with was really nice and helpful and responded really fast!!
We definetly recommend it."
"Tried the app for a month. The AI did not seem to do anything but raise the CPC way higher than it was when I run manual ads.
I got worse results with the app compared to manual ads. Also less exposure for the same money. The interface also is terribly slow and there are some issues with the interface itself. For example you can choose up to 5 videos when making facebook and instagram ads, but adscale only create ads with one of the selected videos. I asked the customer service about this and their answer is that adscale only suports one video per ad set. Then why do they allow you to select five different ones? I tried this app since I was tired of babysitting the ads manager but it was not a solution that worked for me. If you have some knowledge about runing ads you should stay clear of this app."
"I've been extremely impressed by this app and the support I received. The quick add buttons on the collections was a key feature I was looking for, and I tried several competitors. Fast Checkout was my favorite editing experience and user experience, and it clearly outperforms paid apps with the same features."
I really like this app. It saves me a lot of time and energy. Very good user experience in this app definitely deserves 5 stars
"I have been working with AdScale for 7 or 8 months now, great service and convenient interface that helps making life easier. Highly recommend to anyone who wants to take more control of their advertising process on the networks. It is highly recommended."
"This app is great!!! It is one of the best apps out there for SEO!
With an easy interface and tools to speed up my website, it helped me tremendously.
Thank you!"
I just installed this app and I am amazed how intuitive the interface and the handling is. The banner looks great on my store with all the customization options. But my personal favorite is the sticky add to cart button. Great work!
"After searching for a good shoppable gallery app, I finally found this one, which looks nice and functions well. They made it very easy to tag products to pictures, and overall the interface is clean and user-friendly.
Customer service was super helpful!
Thanks!"
I really like the app. It has very friendly interface that connects perfectly with Google MC. The support team was great all the way helping me to approve my products blocked by Google. They went above and beyond explaining the process and consulting me on how to resolve the complicated issues with Google.
"It was challenging to find an app to create a simple, easy to use, no fuss gallery. Lookbook did the job and the team was very responsive to fix any issues that appeared. For the cost, I expected more CSS customization options and better user experience - like the possibility to move the product tag after it has been created for example, but overall it's working well for our store!"
"This app is great! I needed a better way to sort recipes on our website and this allows the functionality I needed/wanted to make the user experience better. The developer, Choong, was very responsive to help with any issues or customizations, and is working to improve some of behind the scenes user experience (which I think will take this app to the next level) from an ease of use and time saving ability. I did have to clean up my blog tags (recipe keywords) in Shopify to make this function exactly how I wanted, but it was worth it and I think it will be worth it for our users and clients."
Lookbook provides a new way of presenting your regular boring PLPs . Easy to use interface combined with support from the team helped us bring out better pages in the process... i highly recommend the app ... just too good
"Best Google Shopping App for Shopify, easy integration, great interface which helps you to optimize your scores, over all an amazing app"
"I am using the application recently and it has been very easy to configure, I have some suggestions to the interface but is very intuitive and has everything that I currently required, Really simple to use App with standard features. Support is fast and willing to solve your issues. Thanks a lot! The price I think can be lower!"
Really easy to use and very efficient. Made the process of shipping very quick. User friendly interface and good customer care.
"Amazing !
1)Very cheap pricing
2)Simple to use
3)You can customize the button's color to your own brand
4)Great interface for the customer
5)The support answered me very quick
For now I'm giving it 5stars and deleted all other tracking apps, overtime I'll see if I change my mind. Meanwhile I highly recommend it."
Great app. Love the interface on both my website and the back end. Easy to navigate. Great set of tools to use for influencers and social media.
"I probably don't use this app for its fully intended purpose (the online store part) but I enjoy using it for my social media feed in my website footer. It does a great job displaying the feed and has an intuitive interface that I like. Overall, quite happy and would recommend this app."
"I wanted to add some flair to my site and thought that adding a live feed would do just that.  After reading the reviews for Snapppt, I decided to give it a try.
This app is very easy to integrate with your site and interfaces seamlessly with your Instagram account.  Besides having to copy a few lines of code so the particular page you want the feed to appear on; everything else is as easy as 1-2-3.
I am only using a fraction of this app's capability.  It is quite a robust solution and even has the capability to offer analytics; important for understanding trends and growth."
"Great page builder I've ever used, I chose EComposer for its eye-catching and easy-to-use interface. Regardless of the fact that this is a new app, everything seems to be fine, there are still some minor issues but the support team always solves everything as quickly as possible. I think this app will have a better place on Shopify app store in the future. Please maintain the same product quality and customer support attitude"
"We have used other apps like this so we are very familiar with how a good one should work. So our opinion is this is a GREAT app! Very clean, easy user interface, Beautiful. Customer service has been quick, beyond helpful and professional. Well done SNPT!!"
Very bad user experience. I want to delete my Insta Feed from your website. Unable to do so. It should clearly specify the countries lists in which this app works. Its not working in India.
"Very Simple and nice user experience. Design for easy store pickup with numerous settings like holiday marker, time slots, multiple store location with google maps etc. Highly recommended app."
"This is a no-star product, fit only for low-effort shopify sites with extremely weak or completely disposable brand identities. If you're serious about your business and customer retention, this app isn't for you.  
Free seems like a great price, but this app doesn't exist for your benefit. Avoid it unless you're happy with the idea of deliberately poking holes in your conversion funnel for the benefit of the Snapppt development team.
On the plus side, installation is very simple, it all seems well coded, and the interface is clean, (although effectively impossible to customize).  Viewing it solely from a technical perspective, it's very well executed.
On the negative side, showcasing your brand is not a priority here.  The app aggressively hijacks your instagram content, your site, and your hard work, turning you into little more than a marketing drone working for Snapppt. 
Image overlays, Snapppt logos, and persistent links are prominently displayed as often as possible, drawing customers away from your ecosystem and your store at every opportunity.
Find a different solution that actually works for you.  If you install this one, you're working for Snapppt."
"Great customer service, easy & simple interface, and easy to use. I like how it is charging based on the number of pre-orders you need and can be canceled at any time when you don't need it anymore."
"Snapppt totally changed how we approach marketing on social media. It gave us the tools and a convenient interface, coupled with our own workflow and creative, to harmonize our marketing in our social media and website.
We look forward to further improvements to the the seller and customer-facing interface, particularly in how the carousel, grid, and sandwich pages appear. But I see no significant flaw that calls for docking a full point. This is a great app."
"Love this app, very friendly interface, and good features. It will be great if I can see the list of my products and images tagged for those products."
"I can't recommend this app enough. Its interface is intuitive and really easy to set up. It offers so much more than other apps in the market and is the best among those I have tried out so far. What impressed me the most is its world-class support and communication. Not only is their team super friendly and personal, I also got the help I needed within minutes (and it was almost midnight!!). Thank you so much Andrei and I can't wait to see the new features that will be coming soon!"
"Love this app, very friendly interface, and good features. It will be great if I can see the list of my products and images tagged for those products."
I love this App. The interface is intuitive and the gallery runs smooth and fast wherever you put them.
"SedikhiiSavingsPlus.Com - Fashion For The Fashionably Fortunate
DropHippo is always prompt in replying to my inquiries. I like the cute purple hippo they have as their mascot/logo. The app itself is really well made. It's got an easy to understand interface, quality photos of products and descriptions already prepared for many items which saves us dropshippers time as we just have to tweak them a little. 
An honest review is nothing without providing constructive criticism and in say so, I suggest DropHippo to increase the amount of products they offer, possibly lower their prices a little on some select items and make sure the basic facts are available such as materials used in making an item. 
No app is absolutely perfect, I may be giving this app 5/5 stars, but only because I'm forced to select 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5. My actually rating is 4.5 stars. There's always room for improvement. 
Thank you for such a great app."
These guys know what they are at. Have changed the game for dropshippers. Their customer service is second to none. The interface for monitoring your sales within the app is top notch & No more relying on long delivery times from China. Thank you Drophippo!
"I started using the Fabrikator app to better manage my production process. Since we are a very small team managing a lot of aspects of the business at once, it's been really helpful to see all the information we need at one place. The setup was very easy and the interface is really user friendly. Their team was so helpful with the few problems and questions we had. Highly recommended!"
"We've been using Fabrikatör for 2 months as one of their first customers. Fabrikator app saved us a lot of time by setting the safety stock levels automatically and warning us when it is the right time to restock. We tried other inventory apps as well but they all had steep learning curves and unfriendly user interfaces. The team is amazing when it comes to customer support. They do not only resolve our issues immediately but also act as a consultant that provides useful resources and makes introductions to other experts in different domains for helping our business to grow. In short, we are happy to be heard and recognised as a customer of Fabrikator."
The app is very simple to use and displays all of the information we need. The developer has great communication and was able to implement the few requests we had in a timely manner. The interface is easy to use and looks great on our website! Now customers can browse through our list of dealers and find one near them!
"This is a great app we use for ebay and amazon, and the customer support is amazing with their quick help in the support chat whenever needed. We've been using this app for about 2 years now, and there hasn't been a problem we were unable to solve. There are a few quirks in the app when compared to using the ebay and amazon channels natively that you have to have work arounds for, but thankfully those work decently. It is also a learning curve and there could be major improvements on the interface to make it easier on the user. But regardless of that, this app does the job it claims to do and has helped us more than hurt us and for that 5 stars are given. I highly recommend that any new user to this app, first reach out to their support team before installing it to have a knowledgable tech member help onboard you and the team, and have your channel (ebay/amazon/etc) preferences enabled and correctly carried over to avoid any potential areas you might miss during this process and future issues that could arise from that."
"A fast and easy way to add a curbside pickup option to our store.  Ali customized our emails and customer interface to match our brand and store. Easy to set up, easy to modify, without having to change anything about our Shopify locations or shipping origins."
"Meets our needs, very straightforward user experience. 5 stars for the excellent, fast customer service!"
Brilliant app with exceptional customer service. On numerous occasions Lech has answered questions for me and has also taken on board improvements that would help my business and implemented them. The app is straight forward to set up. Its interface isn't as elegant as some apps but its powerful and provides detailed customisation for every aspect of my sales. It even works alongside my xero tracked inventory using the SKU numbers I have created in both systems. I can highly recommend this app. I did try others and then tried this one and have not looked back.
"Hello All,
I wanted to give my assessment on how I integrated my Shopify store to Xero Accounting. I run an e-commerce store (www.suvabeauty.com) and we started selling in March 2015 and I migrated to Shopify & Xero Accounting in April 2015. We are a Canadian company (that sells in USD$) so this is key to my post as I found that my integration options were more limited for Canadian’s And/Or dual currency Xero/Shopify Setups.
My integration strategy started out with:
•	Manual Integration – Painful & Time consuming
•	Tried Zapstitch – Didn’t handle my currency situation well and didn’t help much with bank reconciliation (But the setups looks great for a lot of people)
•	Tried, Carry The One (CTO) – The User Interface isn’t as fancy but the actual automation easily handled my currency/tax integration. AND, most importantly it allowed me to automate my bank reconciliation!. 
Most of XERO recommended apps have great support as if you are not responsive in today’s market you will fail very quickly. I was especially happy about the support offered by Carry The One as well because I even made an large error in my setup (Ughhh..) which caused transactions to be attributed to the wrong account. CTO support (Shout out to Lech) spent an hour with me over Skype and went through everything line by line and helped me correct everything. Well done.
If you have any questions about my path to automation (isn’t that our ultimate dream!) let me know as I am in early days as well and like to hear your experiences."
"Great support, simple, easy-to-use interface - low price point. What's not to like? Great product..."
"Awesome app, easy to use, install and configure. Shopify breadcrumbs can be a hassle because there's no way to organize them based on menu structure, but with Category Breadcrumbs, you can create great breadcrumb navigation that will improve the user experience of your Shopify store. Thank you, Alex, for providing such a great app!"
So far it is very easy to use. VM of the website is better ands resulted in a better user interface for us
good app. now have to see if it works properly. just installed it to my store. the interface looks nice.
"This is an amazing app - amazingly simple interface and impressive results - works like magic! To top it off, their customer service is world class. We had an issue where we created a discount based on a collection but wanted to exclude a few products from getting the discount applied. We reached out to Wensia and Marius called us back. He was super helpful. Immediately understood what we were trying to achieve, and the limitations of the app. He was technically sound and knew what needed to be fixed. He asked for 30 minutes and came back with a recommended solution - a product enhancement to include option for excluding specific products. That enhancement was coded, tested, and implemented in next 3 hours!! I have never seen another software company respond to a request at this speed and with the empathy demonstrated by Marius. They have made a fan out of us. We will highly recommend this app to anyone looking for a simple, easy, and efficient solution for automated discount management. Thank you Marius and Wensia!"
Sales Countup works great. Excellent support coupled with an easy to use interface - can't ask for more.
Good app and user experience to help us reach more customers on the bing marketplaces. Would recommend to other e-commerce companies.
"When it comes to insuring the deliveries I send it’s always been a total nightmare. I used to do all my parcel insurance through the courier but found that trying to make a claim was impossible and took forever and only paid out a fraction of the cost of the item. I found Offcourse when looking for an alternative option to using the insurance couriers offer and honestly I can say it’s one of the best things I’ve ever done for my business. The interface is so simple and pulls in all your orders straight from Shopify. It has really in depth delivery tracking, so much so I’d recommend downloading it for the tracking alone! The beauty of this insurance is you choose what you cover based on the cart value. I tend to insure anything over £50 so it works really well for me. The best aspect of this insurance and app for me is that it’s automated. If a delivery of mine is late, the app starts a claim for me. I don’t have to do anything, no forms, nothing. It’s genius. I never knew insurance could be this simple. If you do have to make a claim, which I unfortunately have, getting your money is really simple. They pay me any of my claim payouts every month and they go straight into my bank account. Before, I used to get my payouts by cheque and wait ages for them to clear. This service has saved me so so much time and money. Plus, my reviews have been so much better because my customers have less complaints about bad deliveries, I can send out replacements asap knowing I will get my claim payout so quickly. I couldn’t recommend them enough!!"
"With a very simple and effective interface, together with a great price structure, MagicPass is a must in my opinion for separating our site into the compartments needed for wholesale and retail selling."
"Do you need a simple Order Page? This is your app!
I really like the flexibility of the interface. Lots of options to modify the look and feel to get exactly you want. 
I have asked for some slight modifications which they accomplished very quickly with no issues or charges. :) 
We have some paid for work coming forward for Zestard and so far their rates are very reasonable. 
Looking forward to a long partnership."
"Awesome: clean interface, easy to set up, great conditional variety."
"Addition has been a life saver in streamlining the customer checkout, and order fulfillment process. Many apps out there have super overwhelming interfaces, and many areas to click through, whereas this app takes all the parts you really need, and puts it into one super easy to navigate workflow. The customer service provided here is also second to none... quick and responsive, and able to overcome problems with ease! They helped me with the setup process and I can't give enough credit to how helpful they were the whole way through. There are still some features yet to come which will certainly help with organising things from the users side such as profiles and import/exporting tables, as for now it's pretty straightforward (which isn't necessarily a bad thing) so that will be very appreciated and basically make this a no-brainer app for anyone wanting to implement shopify and Australia Post. Keep up the great work guys."
"Really good experience using the app on our store. Only thing I would like to see is a clearer User Interface when scheduling a time when events start and end. Its just a couple of times when an intern has scheduled 12:01PM incorrectly, thinking it was 12:01AM. Maybe a black-out or fade over feature when the scheduling during the night would help this for other users."
"This app is extremely easy to use and the support provided by Addition to get it integrated was some of the best support I've ever been provided. I had several questions and everything was answered extremely clearly and very quickly. I don't think I ever waited longer than a few hours for a reply. I migrated from MyPost Business to eParcel and it saves SO much times it's crazy for the super cheap monthly price. The interface used to create labels and lodgements is very clear and intuitive. There is a very good reason this app has a 5.0 star rating, and I cannot recommend it enough. If you have any doubts at all with any of the features, I highly recommend speaking to support as I'm sure they can make it happen. Very happy!"
Very reasonable cost. Easy to setup. Good looking user interface. Just an overall great app and you should give it a shot
"This app improves my shopper's checkout experience, it's the only ""slide/drawer"" cart I'm aware of that includes upsells and/or recommended products in the slide along with a ""status bar"" to reach a preset threshold for free ship, free gift, etc. It's interface is easy to use and intuitive, so it won't take long to get it operational."
"Very inconvenient to use. Not at all a user friendly interface. Need more options like edit COD amount, time frame for estimated time of delivery while booking needs to be shown. Needs a lot of work."
BC INTERFACE TOOOOO SLOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW ZERO RATING STAR LKB
"i used Delhivery service, its very effective for my business, User interface is soo easy to use for anyone. Timely receive payment of week on week.
Thanks"
The app has a couple of bugs.. and is Super slow but has never crashed ever! so good job guys but there is a lot of scope to improve. The User interface could be much much better especially if you are as big a company as Delhivery. You can't be okay with the current User interface. Hope you guys improve upon the above things. But Like the functionality overall.
I am using this app for a week and it works like charm. The app works exactly as the description and there is no lag or issues. The app interface is completely user-friendly and the support (Mohit) is top-notch. He helped me with setting up everything. This app really saved me a lot of time. Since it is free I highly recommend giving it a try.
The user interface is really good easy to navigate. You can probably add like an dashboard where I can see the summary of everything cod balance wallet balance ect. Overall nice app
"The app is easy to use and has a user-friendly interface, but integration should be done automatically."
I install the app today and create my 1st campaign in a blink of an eye. The interface is very user friendly and campaigns are easy to configure. Will see in the next days if conversion will increase! See it in action at www.DDdailyNews.com.
"This is incredibly hard work - the user interface is not intuitive.  I have spent the last 3 hours trying in vain to create a catalogue despite a video introduction.  It is difficult to change the order in which products are added to a catalogue.  It is impossible, as far as I can see to edit the size of text boxes below products (i.e. if you have a smaller photo, you can't increase the amount of text space available).  Suppport is cheery, but not very helpful.  If they create a catalogue for you, you can't then edit on-line what they have done becasue the bespoke service uses different tools.  Can someone please develop a catalogue builder that uses drag and drop with easy re-sizing of the various elements."
Zebundler is perfection. It is everything we wanted and needed in a bundling app and more. Our core to our business. The options to offer a bundle on the user interface or bundle behind the scenes and offer the bundle as a single product is wonderful. The customer service is superb. Zebundler is in a league of its own. Thank you for creating this software!
"wonderful app on entire shopify platform for providing comprehensive sms solution which includes abandon cart recovery, marketing campaigns and shipping notifications. simple interface, affordable pricing and features like custom branded url and sender id makes it the best in its class. Moreover the best part is the support, especially the man Arpit, you throw the problems at him and he has the solution for you. Very prompt response, understands the needs of customers and always available for help. Highly recommended!"
"crazy app , very very good , very easy to use . 10333.51% ROI , suggest to take a try .  But the interface is so ugly. Haha ,please work hard to do better."
"Strong integration with Shopify, the products, the variants, and all the necessary details are automatically available for editing and adding for catalog building.  Beautifully designed minimalist interface is simple and elegant. It's worth it."
One of the best tracking app I have used. Really like the whole interface of it. Highly recommend it!
App is not accurate. I see missed checkouts. I go to see how the customer user experience was and I don't see anything recorded.
Very limited interface with many shortcomings in comparison to other similar apps. The app would have gotten 1 star only but chat support is very good and great customer service that gives usefull answers should always be rewarded.
Plobal has been a great interface for us to use to help manage our mobile app! It has been great working with their team and using Plobal!
"Awesome app! makes the work really easy - the interface is really user-friendly.  It helped in expanding the business overall.
Very helpful and dedicated team - they try to resolve the issues as soon as possible. 
choosing them was the best decision."
Poor interface and no option to change currency. I applied discounts and they are not working. Waited 4 days to get it installed.
Great support. I had a problem with the app and Luke gave super fast support. I'll be using this app for a long time. Hope we can improve the user interface of of the widget though.
Really fast responses and great customer service! Easy-to-use interface and really friendly staff that is always there to help with any situation.
"Anna from the customer support team is super prompt and efficient in getting any technical requests addressed. There was one time when we experienced a glitch in the app and she had it fixed very quickly. Another time, I faced a specific issue, and Anna helped offer some suggestions on how to resolve it. The phone interface for the app could use a bit of improvement, but the fantastic customer service makes up for it :) Thanks guys!"
"Don't be fooled by the silly logo or oldschool interface. Wonderful app, easy to set up, and great support when needed. Would highly recommend it! 5 STARS!"
"So far so good! Yuvraj has been helping me all day, he even called me to help me figure a couple things out! I love the instant chat feature, and the helpful documents that they have ready to guide you step by step as well! The interface itself is very user friendly... I found it quite easy to design my app to look the way I wanted. I love that Plobal has an additional app for the designer to preview on your mobile phone to see how it's looking! That's very helpful in visualizing the end result. Yuvraj has also helped me step by step figure out what needs to be done with google & apple so that my app can go live! I've had a really great experience and we look forward to seeing how our new app helps our company!"
"Cross Sell is a great app to increase cross-sales and improve the user experience of the customer's purchase process. We highly recommend this app, in addition to their fantastic customer service, they respond very quickly to solve any problems you may have with the implementation and they are very kind."
"If you want to have an app for your online store, then I highly recommend this app, it has a user friendly interface, easy to use and the most important thing is Plobal Apps team, they are very friendly, supportive, honest and smart, they are targeting to provide you a quality service. I usually don't write reviews however that team really impressed me by the very professional way they deal with their clients, they got everything ready in very short time and launched the app for me very smoothly, then they were always there to answer any inquires. Thank you Probal Apps team for your great support and team spirit, please keep it up!"
I used this app to recommend specific products on the product pages and it makes the user experience more meaningful. The backend selection of the related product is intuitive and user friendly too. Josh and his team were very responsive in the support in helping to resolve some issues that i needed for my website. Thanks!
"Works great and saves a lot of time. Easy interface. Well-worth the money, making it a must-have for every Shopify site!"
"Amazing customer support and fantastic app, the search interface is very fast providing a great user experience to our customers. We have 1000s of products and the search handles the queries very fast."
"The user interface needs some work. It's a bit confusing. It also hangs sometimes on my laptop (Mac OS X 10.9 with Chrome).
It is not as automated as I would prefer. They asked me to arrange conference call. It is supposed to be automatic. What's the point of having AI if you still need conference call to discuss targets & goals? I was thinking I could just set up my goal and the AI will take it from there.
Customer support seems decent. Hence why I gave 3 stars."
Amazing customer service and the interface is super clean. It has increased my conversion rate since installing. Will be continuing to use this on my store indefinitely! Highly recommend!
Freaking awesome app! Super simple interface that gives me more options than I knew I wanted...and then used a lot of them! It really hits a nice balance between simple UI and nice design; and integrated seamlessly with our custom theme without any coding.
"App was easy to add, seamlessly integrated across product lines, and was intuitive to make modifications to suit our site.
An instant hit with customers who could add products to cart at a simple click.
Highly recommended - user experience has only been positive!"
Great currency converter! It works very fast and is easy to set up in the user interface. Thank you so much!
Great App! Easy to install. Converts according to the current rate. You can choose different currencies and different interface
Should have installed this earlier. Straightforward easy to use. The team explained it well. You can search for order number/customer name when presented with a tracking number that has issue which shopify is unable to search/index. Display recent tracking status in a list. Customers are updated from time to time via email. Gets to upsell via email. You can also edit the interface. Cool
The team was very helpful on getting this set up correctly on our store! Appreciate their willingness to customize the interface to match my theme as well.
"The app worked OK. But the app's interface, and what it presents to the customer is not as clean and professional looking as the Cancellable app — which we've now switched to."
"Amazing loyalty system. Does everything (points loyalty, referrals) and is completely customizable. Very modern and intuitive interface, support is super responsive and friendly."
Very clean interface with plenty of options.  No coding needed to install and easy to use.  Visually appealing on the customer end and well priced.  Customer support was quick and helpful.
"The Builder.io platform is nothing but AMAZING!!! We don't have a developer on our team, so we hire freelancers when we need to build a page or landing page. Working with Builder, we built landing pages, A/B test them, see heat maps, and basically, all our marketing and UX dreams in one place. This must-have platform for any company that understands the user experience is science and never-ending tests and improvement.
This is freedom for any marketing and UX teams!
Support is very fast and great as well."
"Very cool this app for everything, i raccomanded. For me this is the best app for this work! free plane avaible.
I love the use-frienldy interface."
They need to clean up the interface a bit because it's confusing at times but overall love this app! Especially since Shopify got rid of the picture editing options.
"Plugin suddenly crashed? ? The entire module on the product page can't display the picture at first, and then the entire module disappears directly. There is no way to try to re-insert it. I have checked that the package fee has been paid, and it is currently in use. Please contact us after seeing it! ! I can't get into the interface of this plugin configuration at all! ! Update: I can't find the entry to send you email feedback, the plugin is still unavailable, what should I do?"
"We're using the app to create our product labels. We were looking for a solution where we can directly create the barcodes (EAN-13 & QR) in the layout we needed - Barcode Man is a great solution! Really easy to use interface, the design choices (fonts etc.) are fine for us. Bust most importantly: the customer service is amazing! We had a request for a feature that wasn't included yet, and Will was so nice and directly started working on a fix for us."
Great App at a great price with super support! I also like the interface which blends nicely in my theme.
"This app is amazing! I was a bit hesitant to install this after trying 5 other filtering apps and being disappointed. I also was hesitant because I had to wait for the company to install the app for me. However, it was COMPLETELY WORTH THE WAIT! It was installed in less than 24 hours, works better than expected, and has the nicest user interface of all the filtering apps. I was so impressed and hope that the company creates other apps that include the thought and care that went into this one."
"Extremely useful app, and the customer service is impeccable! The user interface of this app should be used in teaching developers how to make apps comprehensive even for non-technical users."
"great!nice tool!The entire interface is clear and easy to use
Very fast customer service response, help me to modify the Rating position!"
"Thumb Up, I will say this is the best Wishlist app (tried other before) I have used up til now. And good supporting and very easy to use interface. If you still searching for a wishlist app, I highly-recommended this one, your visitor (specially those new visitors) no need to login / create an account after click ""Add to Wishlist""."
"This app is a great way to add wishlist functionality to your website with a simple, clean interface (that can be extensively customised) and the only one I know of that doesn't require a customer to setup an account etc (though they can if they'd like to save a wishlist etc).
I found the developer particularly helpful and willing to answer my many questions about getting the app to work with my very minimal website design.
He was also very open to hearing ideas or features I wished it had.
If you're looking for a wishlist app I'd totally recommend Wishl Wishlist"
Really great support whenever I have a question or run into dramas. Easy interface to set up lightbox
"Installed this app just recently, but I use it every day to monitor the cart activity. Love the clean interface and ease to work with."
"It was a great user experience, especially with timely assistance. It was great help to operation. Great."
worst thing i have ever seen store here. Worst interface worst functionality.  waste of time........................................
"We used the app to manually handpick products that are bought together to make the user experience much better when different products can be combined to match. The app is great and not complicated at all, when we have needed help with certain things the team are very responsive and helpful."
"This app made my integration with eBay extremely easy! The interface is very useful and saved me a lot of time, plus the support is extremely reliable and responsive!!"
"This app has been a game changer for us. We launched and connected ShoppingFeeder which was super-easy. We then subscribed to the PriceCheck channel and sent our feed to PriceCheck. We also used the easy integration with Google Merchant Center and Google Ads and created our first Smart Shopping Ad right in the ShoppingFeeder interface.
Within one day we had already generated our first few sales! This really surprised us and we weren't even ready for all the sales. 
Things we loved:
1. We didn't need any developer skills to get a valid XML feed.
2. Our was/now pricing was automatically included in the feed
3. Really easy Google Merchant Center and Ads integration
4. We could manipulate our product titles and descritions per channel based on Brand and Category
5. We loved that we could add all 10 of our stores to one premium account and not pay extra.
6. Hands-on support
Things we'd like to see coming to the platform:
1. Would love to see multiple images supported in the feed
2. We'd love to be able to pay annually for the app for a small discount
3. Support for Facebook Shops
All-in-all 5/5 from us. Thanks so much to the ShoppingFeeder team."
"Awesome App! Works well! Great Support Team! Thanks!
The only suggestion we have is to make manual recommendations interface more user-friendly."
Great interface and service. I would recommend to anyone who is nervous about synching ebay with Shopify.
"Remarkety feels half baked. 
Unhelpful support bar ----> There's a customer support bar down to the right that is always there, but appears to say on workdays and weekends alike that customer support is not available right now. When you send them a customer service response, there is no email indicating it was received or indicating when they will get back to you or when. There is a generic message. They have a generic Zen Desk ""page through our catalogue of files yourself"" Zen Desk support bot, which is of minimal help and generally annoying to deal with. That's when you turn to Google for help, but Google doesn't seem to care much for Remarkety, so Google searches are not helpful either. 
Of particular frustration ---> When attempting to save a campaign, there's an error message that says ""You may not send this campaign from a gmail.com address."" It makes perfect sense why you can't send from a gmail.com address. Unfortunately, the message does not report to the user ""You cannot save this file with a gmail.com address, please change your address to gmail.com."" This unfortunately resulted in our team losing quite a bit of work that we thought was being saved. When I pointed that out to customer service, I felt like I was talking to an evangelist on why it was bad to allow anyone to save a file if a gmail address is connected to the file. That was frustrating. I pushed the issue and he said lukewarmly that he would contact the product team about improving the error message. I don't expect that email to the product team to be sent. Other spots in the program, such as the settings page advise against using a Gmail address, but don't instruct that you cannot save or send with a gmail address, they indicate the exact opposite - that you can actually send with a gmail address (which would be a bad practice, but this is an indication of the product being half baked when one page says on thing, the error message says something else, and the zen desk bot, google, and a search of the website have no easily accessible commentary on this topic). 
More generally ---> The files and tutorials explaining how to use the product are not very thorough, and don't have great SEO so that I can't find what I need easily on google the way I can with other email marketing programs that are more established. The online tutorials done by third parties are not very expansive, probably because this company is not very established as an email platform. Some email platforms have extensive how to coverage by third parties.  This lack of in house explanation and the lack of 3rd party desire to explain the program add a layer of difficulty in using this for anything but the boilerplate sending of boilerplate emails. Over two days of work, my team encountered this problem 10 or 15 times. That's a high number, and makes it hard to use this program. Effectively, this program does not have any easily searchable or easily accessible user manual. So, using remarkety is kind of like  the opposite of buying IKEA furniture - it's like buying furniture by mail order in the late 1990s and it comes with instructions for assembly written only in Chinese, and then you frustratingly stumble through the process with half a dozen parts awkwardly left over that you can't make sense of. 
Their marketing ---> Some of their marketing to me, an existing customer, doing a 14 day trial run (I'm on my 3rd day of the trial run) are not very sophisticated, and I would like to see more sophistication from an app that exists to teach me how to market better. It's sort of a ""do as I say, not as I do approach to marketing."" 
Inflexible software ---> The software is not very flexible in what it can do. That's been a bit of an annoyance, which feels like it is perhaps not designed with significant user input. That would be okay if it were easier to understand it through guides and tutorials. 
They pickup the phone during New Jersey business hours ---> To the benefit of this company, they are reachable at the phone number 800-570-7564, and then pressing 2 gets you to customer service. There wasn't any queue to reach them, there wasn't any prolonged attempt by a computer to have a phone conversation with you. To my discredit I was disheartened over the weekend when I say the customer service is not available message and didn't bother to call. I should have tried to call immediately. Monday morning when I saw the same customer service is not available message, I decided to call. It would have been good to call sooner, it's possible someone would have picked up the phone for me at that number over the weekend. They might have phone support outside of New Jersey business hours. I credit them for the easy phone support. Phone support could smile more. It felt like it was a rough Monday morning and probably raining in New Jersey when the guy picked up the phone. Phone support possibly smiles more on other days. 
Conclusion ---> Sort of a Meh experience with Remarkety. It's neither intuitive nor well explained. I need either a good UX or a good manual. One or the other. I think it's time for us to try another platform. I think they need 2-3 more years of work. Not sure if I want to be the beta tester calling them once a week to offer them feedback as I struggle through the half baked software - which is what will inevitably happen if we incorporate this into our business more fully and push the limits some with this software. Using them unfortunately feels like I am working with people who want to make a quick buck selling a startup, or who maybe see their software as a lifestyle product, but it doesn't feel like I'm working with someone who actually wants to deliver a high quality user experience, which is really all I want from marketing software. The software is a free trial, but if we use it across all stores, it will end up being something like $1200 / month that it will cost us. This software is not worth the $1200 per month for this amount of trouble, and ideally with scalable software the 14 day free trial, and the $25 intro rate, and the $1200 rate are all able to provide the same level of robustness to the customer. I'm not seeing it. Blundering through Remarkety with no saved email campaigns at the end of the process was not how I would have liked to see anyone on my team spend their weekend."
Great app.  Very easy to use interface and when used to its full potential can really increase your marketing efficiency and sales.
This is a fantastic app to meet many different conditions you will need to send to your customers.  The interface is easy to follow. It set ups quickly and easily in your store.  Customer support is impeccable.  A must have for any store.
"Remarkety is a great way to manage all you promotional email (excl. newsletters) in one place. The setup is easy and quick, the interface is intuitive, the default templates are exactly what every business might need and the support is responsive. Great work guys!"
"We've been using Remarkety to handle campaigns geared at past customers, and so far have seen some great returns. The interface is easy to use and the Remarkety team has been extremely responsive to questions."
"Great App! Neat interface, very easy to use and straight to the point. It helped me keep my customers' inquiries organized and within reach."
"Does exactly what it claims to do. I noticed accesses from countries I don't ship to in my shopify reports and wanted to deter those visits to conserve website resources and potential copycats.
The interface is pretty easy to figure out but it has many sophisticated options to get very granular, so I had to ask for help. I sent a quick chat message to the app's support team and they responded promptly. Highly recommend this app to anyone wanting to block access from market regions they don't serve.
Tip: I chose to redirect instead of block (yes you can do that with this app) and I redirected to https://search.brave.com/search?q=divani+chocolate to keep the word circulating about our wonderful business! :)"
"For quite some time we have been searching dor a way, how to reliably synchronise our 2 eBay and 1 Shopify shop and shat I have to James worship for, is the real-time synchronization and reliability of the synchronization. The Trunk-app interface is also very intuitive and easy to use uncluding the creation of part lists (BOM) - such a feature i missed while working earlier in standard ERP-Systems ..."
"Cinch replaced Klaviyo for us, and we've found its capabilities and interface to be superior in nearly every way. The addition of direct mail and SMS has been awesome. If you're using Klaviyo or another ESP and looking for more data and communication options, I would give Cinch a look."
Pretty useful and practical app and has a very easy-to-use interface. You can choose between a few very useful converting options. I recommend testing it
"I love Trunk, superb user interface, easy to learn and it just works! The de-kitting feature is a lifesaver. The only thing that I didn't like, which is why I gave it 4 stars is pricing, it is a little steep for startups."
This app perfect for my needs. Clean user interface and easy to customize. The support is incredible too. You must definitely give it a try
"We tested a number of apps and settled on EXPO because it was the simplest user interface and synced all options with products smoothly. We have tested it out on a number of complex products with conditional logic and are super happy with how it works and integrates. Also the support has been responsive and incredibly helpful. So glad we went with this app, thanks SeedGrow for making our lives less complicated!"
"The app works well. Gives our website some added features with a simple interface. I would recommend it. It would be helpful to allow users to set their own background color. It seems to be a purple color now and doesn't always fit with website themes. Either give user option or change to a more light grey color which seems to be more industry standard. As a followup, the team made these changes quickly and effectively. Great support!"
"Its a really good app. and  nice user interface . Easy to use and very happy with this app
Highly Recommended to all"
Happy Fastmag est pour moi la meilleure application pour connecter son Fastmag et Shopify. L'interface est facile d'utilisation et son équipe est réactive et efficace.
Installed the application and created cashback campaign. Hopefully will get the boost in sales revenue. Nice badge display and nice interface of the application. Very user-friendly.
"Super easy to use and is a good looking menu interface on the users end. Support is great & addresses concerns promptly. Wish there was a bit more flexibility in widget size, though."
"I use the app to streamline the meta title and description. Works well, and pretty simple interface once you get the hang of it."
"Decent app, could do with a slightly easier user interface and explanation, but the end result is good"
"This is exactly what we were looking for, it works great. We wanted an interactive control and this is perfect. Easy to use interface, no programming and if you have questions Luke is ready to help. I highly recommend it to all Shopify stores"
Rewardify. app was super easy to install and the user experience has been great! It allows us to create a rewards program with ease. It also comes with a flexible theme extension that will make it easy to match our site's look and feel!
Great interface and customer service support for any questions/queries. I have established e-commerce store and wanted to obtain additional inventory for the festive period. Sync2Fashion is right application for my needs.
"This is a good app that does exactly what it says it does, and Vishal was very quick to respond when I needed help.  
The only thing that I suggest is making the app's interface easier to understand.  The FAQ page says to use the ""import tab"" for bulk syncing multiple ASIN, and it took me about 30 min of searching to realize that this isn't offered in the lowest tier package.  Also, the code snippets on the install guide page are blank.
Other than that, it works great once you figure it out and I'll probably use it again when the need arises."
"I have been using ASR to help me locally deliver a salad subscription from my farm. The interface is very simple, straightforward, and intuitive. The customer service is great. I'm glad to be using this app."
"Very bad experience about this app, Support staff of Affiliatify can't response various time contact but still not answer at all, App is not working last 7 days but Affiliatify team can work on it. I can't edit my link ""Message Shown on Screen admin’s server IP address could not be found.""  
Now the app has not been working for the last week (link in my store admin does not open the app interface), and their developer website appears to be shut down too.
Too bad, it was a good idea.
Thanks"
"I wanted to like this app but I had trouble when it was first installed and requested support from the developer twice with no response. Eventually Shopify support helped me figure out that it doesn't work with Safari. 
Now the app has not been working for the last week (link in my store admin does not open the app interface), and their developer website appears to be shut down too. 
Too bad, it was a good idea. 
Update 3/31/20--the developer contacted me and said they fixed the problems. I can't verify this personally as I have deleted it, but he said it works."
Absolutely simple interface that enables some neat-o trickery with your shipping rates. Our store uses a simple implementation of their tool but the possibilities are truly great. The devs are also quite responsive if you're ever if need of any help or guidance.
"The app did what it claims, but the interface was a problem for us.  We were looking to ship certain items for free.  While the app can accomplish this, it requires you to mark the items manually that you wish to ship for free.
A simple Tag 'FreeShipping' or Collection would accomplish this, but it isn't able to use those.
This app had promise, but that oversight was a big one."
"This is definitely THE BEST app on Shopify for customizing pages. I love the interface and usability!! The help of the team is incredible and saved a LOT of Time and Money! This app has no analogs and every one who wants to have beautiful pages need it!
I would totally recommend this app over any other drag and drop page editor apps out there on Shopify app store.
Guys!! You are just AWESOME! Thank you very very much!!!"
"this app makes great pages and is easy to use and understand. only down side is that it is very buggy. text appears where it shouldn't, previews stop updating, not a very easy going interface."
This app can do everything that I expected Shopify would be able to do. I was very disappointed with Shopifiy's interface for design and customizing and was testing several other apps with those functions. Not only was this one of the cheapest ones but it is also nice to use and has useful templates. Their support was fast and friendly. I'm curious to see how long term testing will be but for now i'm very happy.
"I have been looking for something exactly like this for a long time. Love how easy it is to navigate. I tried a couple other apps similar to this and I will be the first one to say CMS is 10000x better in terms of user experience and how easy it is to set up and look good. 
LOVE IT!!! 
THANKS FOR CREATING THIS AWESOME APP!!"
"We use this ap to have our customers select a pick up or delivery time. As our product is food and expires, its important to have our customers request the day they wish to have it. I initially had some issues removing the BUY NOW button which would allow the customer to not interface with the calendar. I sent an email and within an hour they had gone in and made the required changes. Awesome service."
"So easy to use!
My store's exposure was increased as I gained more stories.
Finally an app that combines shopify's easy to use interface with instagram's great social media content."
"Its amazing simply interface and dashboard. Was very easy guided process of setting up my app. Support team works over the clock to make it even easier. Just waiting to be launched and can't wait!! over excited, our dreams come through much faster with BizWizely! Great job guys! Thanks a lot."
Just started using this app and it's perfect! Very intuitive interface and good customer support! I am sure I will keep using this app for my store returns.
"As a new Shopify store user, this app is easy to install and use, exceeding my expectations in terms of functionalities, user interface and helpful customer service."
"This app does work. Certainly pays for itself, but the design, and support are terrible. The user experience is poor, stats don't actually report correctly, the support chat window pops open on every screen making configuring this app on mobile a nightmare."
"I love this app! The team at Jasper were very helpful in guiding me through the setup. My favorite part of the PIM is the product relations feature. I also wanted to have the ability to set up a staging store to trial my products before publication. The app responds quickly, and I really like the interface. I’m not super tech savvy, but I find it straightforward to figure out. Also, I plan to use the custom theme Jasper has. I’m excited to be on Shopify and can’t wait to get my stores fully running."
"I ran the trial for a few days but got no results.  The reporting interface is extremely slow and always shows no views, even though I have tested it several times so there should have been at least those views.  The coupon reminder that appears at the top of the web page covers my top menu and logo.  It would be better if it loaded above the top of the page, not over it.  I gave this 3 stars because I only trialled for a few days so maybe it would have yielded some results over a longer time, but the other issues were enough for me to try another service instead."
"In all fairness, I'm giving this app the middle ground rating as I've not discovered it enough to make a good or bad judgment. And, I hate to see a company takes a hit just because of an unfavorable review from someone who's probably not understanding the full functionality of a new app he just tried. But here's my problem: I've downloaded several Paypal Sync apps which offer a trial period to have a feel of the initial user experience. Unlike other apps which take you straight to its Dashboard (to which you have no obligation to add your Paypal account if you wish to) this app requires you to add your Paypal account set up first (which I did). Since I've no transaction going on for a new store, I'm unable to sync anything as prompted. That was it! Stucked at the same page unable to proceed any further. No access to the dashboard, settings, and nothing unless I have it sync'ed. So, do I have to wait to get my first transaction going before I'm able to view the dashboard or something? If that is the case, how am I able to remove the linked Paypal account if I don't wish to continue with this app? This is a bad user experience, man! Other apps allow you to remove the linked account. This one doesn't seem to have the option or am I getting it wrong somewhere? I deleted this app with no hesitation since this seems what the deal is...and not knowing if my Paypal account is still actively attached to it or otherwise. Could you advise me on this as a security assurance that all is good after the deletion? Thanks in advance and sorry it didn't work out."
"I think I've tried every donation app available on the store, and settled on this one as it provided the most user friendly interface and best, most prompt customer service. Thank you!"
We were looking for something engaging and fun for our audience and I saw the demo and just loved the idea of cookies running across the bottom of our website. We are so happy with the way the page turned out and it's already generating tons of traffic and engagement! Thank you so much Markus! Who is super nice and even customized some features for us. Thank you for helping us create an incredible user experience!
The Apptonize App gives the user a very nice user experience and a very clean build up! solid support also!
"Easy to connect with Shopify, and the interface is very simple and friendly. I tried the sourcing quote feature, and I got the quotes after 24 hours, very quick!"
Using this app is really fantastic. Very useful. Interface is very friendly to users who has a basic knowledge in computer.
The user interface is very easy to use. I was using this first time but thanks to the great support team specially Nancy for going beyond expectation. Thank you for this amazing app
"As others have said, I really wanted to like Print Aura. I liked their selection of Bella Canvas apparel and thought it would be a perfect match for what my store needed. That said, if I could give ZERO stars for everything Print Aura -- customer service, support, interface, and the ultimate product -- I would. Their interface is absolutely terrible, mock-ups are only for YOU -- they are NOT used when you order. What? They have a standard place that they stick a standard size 8"" piece of art. Special request? Forget it.
The amount of time I spent (stupidly) trying to get the support I needed, set my business back about a month and I have zero to show for it and I paid full-price for the privilege. 
No matter how many emails I sent, phone calls I made, attempts I tried to get clear communication, it did not happen. I ordered 5 test shirts and 100% of them were exactly what I DID NOT WANT and had written about repeatedly as to avoid this issue. I could not have been more clear that I needed to communicate my creative needs and questions. I asked a series of clear and bulleted questions and only get a few vague answers. And when I didn't get the answers I needed, I tried to cancel my order, but they had been shipped. No apologies, no ""how can we help you be a satisfied customer?"", nothing.
Buh-bye, Print Aura. Moving on to Printful where we should have begun. Their customer service is AMAZING and it's clear they're far more knowledgeable and helpful than the above mentioned."
"I really wanted to like PrintAura. They have a great selection of products. But their interface is wonky. Products are pushed in, and appear on the site, but they will show up as ""sold out"" when you try to checkout. They display as shopify products, not printaura products. It takes over half an hour for orders to appear on the PrintAura website. There is NO PHONE NUMBER for customer support. Too much hassle. Don't bother."
"This is the first company that I've used with my business to print tshirts on demand and I have to say that I'm pretty disappointed.  It is great to be able to have my shirts printed as they're ordered so that I don't have to keep a large supply of products that may or may not sell.  However, everything else about the business is terrible.  
Every product takes a minimum of 3-5 days of processing time before it ships.  I've only been in business a few months and I've already had orders that have taken way longer than 5 days to process.  After contacting Print Aura, it takes a day or so for them to get back to you with a ""we're looking into it"" reply.  It's bad for my business because my customers can go to other websites and get their items shipped within a day or two of purchase.
In addition, they use a digital printer to print the designs on the shirt.  The digital printer does not use enough ink and the quality of the designs is very poor.  They don't offer samples so you have no idea what your items will look like unless you buy them and have them shipped to you.  Then if you need to make corrections, you have to reupload the design and buy the item again.  The shirts also have an odor to them when they arrive in the mail and you have to wash them before you wear them to remove the odor.
Combined with a slow, clunky website and poor user interface, I've not been happy with Print Aura.  As soon as I find something better, I'm jumping ship and moving all of my inventory to another vendor."
Simple and easy to use. all design and interface are templated. not much fuss in creating the pop up. recommended!
"The team is really good and the app has a nice interface, easy to use.
For the price it's better than other upsell app and it has increased the AOV so fully worth it"
"We really like the app. It interfaces well, had some great support (especially getting discounts working) and does what we need it to do. For $10 a month, its saved us a lot of manual processing .. and therefore time."
"I had high hopes, but while the creating part is easy and the interface is okay, it actually doesn't display at all once the code is integrated."
I love this app. It provided me the option to do a popup for promotional offer. It is very easy to use and the interface is user friendly. It also provides the option for choosing of templates which is a plus.
"It generally works but the design interface is wonky. Especially when adding photos, for some reason its hard to maneuver. Otherwise, the pop up still works but the designs are limiting."
I use this for syncing with QBO and it works fine. Some issues appear from time to time but support is really good and things do get corrected within 24 hrs. The user interface could be improved.
"This was absolutely amazing. Simple, very customizable, and smooth interface. Love it. Now lets hope for sales!!!"
simple app that works perfect. Easy interface and full control of the content and promotions you post.
"Selling beers and alcoholic beverages means legal age restrictions. We needed this kind of age checker to ensure visitors are allowed to buy our products. First we had the pop up. Later Chris introduced the Checkout Rules in the cart. This is an extra chance to check the customers age once again before buying. The design is great, functionality and user experience is great. Chris was extremely helpfull, and extremely quick, when I asked for help with a minor adjustment."
"We've been using this app for years without any issues! Today we had a small hiccup during our Mother's Day promotion, but the developer team at Secomapp fixed it within the hour (outside of their regular business hours!) so that we wouldn't have any delay in our user experience. Truly the best customer service. Fast, reliable, and always friendly. #miracleworkers saving my Monday. Thank you!!"
"Testing it now! It behaves very stably and produces an easy to understand interface
Looks like a keeper"
This app is very nice. They will help you solve the problem so quickly. Perfect service！Very good user experience. APP facilitates our product promotion.
"DO NOT INSTALL
This app changes the user interface. It changed the entire arrangement of the website. How do i go back to the normal setting now?? You guys have to provide the solution."
Your bs app screwed up the ENTIRE USER interface after deleting the app. Entire user interface went up into the navbar now its ugly.
The app is outstanding — great user experience and tones of customizability. Support is quick and very good. Would highly recommend it if your selling digital products.
"Michael, This is now our third digital release with you and I cannot express enough how beautiful the interface is. Not only is it user-friendly, but the integration with our backend is just flawless. Working with your team has reduced our setup time with digital download content management and releases by 80%. Furthermore, we are not encountering nearly as many questions or hurdles from major labels / distributors. As you are well aware, Q4 is just an explosion of sales and promotions, but with SOPs your team has in place, we have found working with Single for downloads, livestreams, and reporting; quite beneficial and seamless. Kudos to you and your team -- from Joe and Brendan all the way Tyler and Ron. We look forward to keeping this positive momentum going. All the best,
LLP"
"Anyone selling digital deliverables should have this app. EDP does exactly what it's supposed to do and the support is ASTOUNDING! I've tried numerous apps that take a lot of tinkering to work right, and this is the first one that actually has a fantastic user interface. I was able to get our digital store going in literally 10 minutes, and as we update files switching them out is very quick and easy. And support is fantastic. I've asked Axel several questions to make sure I'm doing something right and even put in a feature request and he's been super quick to respond and very helpful for my organization. I wish every app was as fantastic as this one."
This app is EXACTLY what I was looking for. I tried out SendOwl and it was a complete disaster. Easy Digital Products however is perfect. Strong and reliable feature set and a great interface. Highly recommend!
Majority of products that I sell in my online shop is digital. I had been using other app for a few years and I was looking for an app that's more advance. This app is perfect. The interface is amazing and the customer service is amazing!!!
"I had an issue but the developer reached out super fast, you have to read carefully past the first few paragraphs on the app page, it only fixes descriptions. My issue was a typo in the title of my product that I had copied 50 times over. I will say it had a VERY easy interface and if I ever need to correct something in the description I will be back!"
"Great app, lovely user interface and easy to digest. Extremely easy to set up and get going and great customer support from the team too."
"The app is exactly what it's said to be - ""easy"". Very convenient interface and settings, something that I was missing with other apps. Customer service is second to none. Axel is super responsive and answered in minutes when we had an issue - fixing everything very quickly. Customer service is not so important until it's important - and then you are grateful when it's good. <3"
Great app and very easy to use. Everything is explained in detail and the interface is user-friendly. Extra points to Axel for his support!
"Absolutely amazing plugin, seamless integration with Shopify. Extremely user friendly interface, not sure why people would need to contact support to use this plugin. Thanks Spice Gems!

"I paid 8 Years (!) for 123formbuilder (earlier 123contactform), until I cancelled our subscription today. 
Since we moved to shopify, it was very important to use our forms in different languages to provide a good user experience. 
Unfortunately 123Formbuilder is not working with any language tool (in our case WeGlot), because they are only providing iFrames, div's, etc to embed the forms.
But language tools can not read iFrames, they can only read plain text (e.g. HTML, CSS).
Don't get me wrong, I really liked 123Formbuilder because the usability was nice. For me, back in the days. And it is still a strong tool.
But for me personally they stopped developing in the right way. 
If you do search a Formbuilder that has not such a big functionality, and that is translatable, you can realize it also with e.g. Active Campaign's Formbuilder, (they are providing CSS codes to embed your forms).
I am just giving 2 Stars because I supported this tool so long without using it really, and hoped it developed more into my needs in the meanwhile.
Now where we want to step on the next level, and after a Chat that tooks around 2 hours with installing the app, and trying trying trying (and not working), I am a bit frustrated.
I was expecting more from a service I paid for years."
"Useful app. Simple, clean interface and relatively easy to embed wherever you like, even with zero experience of HTML."
The Shopify interface is perfect and they added the feature to update the inventory upon any refund!
"Easy to use interface, good preset customization options, all SEO features that are mentioned work as expected. And the importer (although in beta) worked great as long as you are comfortable with data transformation. But above all else is the support. Prompt, friendly, and helpful. All around a great app and developer!"
Very detailed and extremely user focused information that is delivered in a way that action is a natural step. Very easy to use interface. Support and ongoing help is a genuine 5 stars.
app is upfront and clear about its services. enjoyable and easy to use. user interface is good. gets the job done
Simple and effective email marketing templates and user interface. You can definitely get all your EDM campaigns done through this one simple app!
"Love the support team, they are really fast and also they provide to us different solutions. We love the interface and also the customise options. Great work!"
"The good: 
Very nice and easy to use interface. 
Very well thought out settings.
So why 2 stars...? The email delivery rate is well below acceptable levels.
all emails were set with a bcc and I have found non-delivery issues daily.
The proof is in the stats- in the 30 days I had switched from the basic Shopify cart abandonment, my recovery rate went from 14% to 9%.
Too bad- because the email look cleaner and have the ability to try to recover with more than one email would be nice."
This app is easy to use! It provides useful features and user friendly interfaces. I highly recommend it!
"What a comfortable app. The back in stock service works great with a minimal and user-friendly interface. The e-mails are automatically sent in the most helpful way letting you concentrate on other tasks. The most important of all? Their support services are absolutely amazing. They solved my issue with a super fast response. 
Thank you Eastside Co.
Keep up the excellent work."
"so far, I really like how easy and simple the interface is. I will see how well this starts to work in a few days."
"Interface is clear and simple to use, the translation are very well processed with instant loading times, it seems native. Support is great, very responsive, friendly and happy to help with any issue at all times. Thank you"
"***UPDATE*** Channable's Tech Support reacted within hours and clarified in a DM, that the Hourly Update module is part of the Order Sync add-on module. That level of clarification I have not been able to distill from their page unfortunately and wasn't able to discover in the test account. In consequence I've updated the rating and added another star. ********************************************************************************** Having compared all relevant feed management tools in test account mode my feedback to Channable was first off ambivalent, however improved after their Tech Support clarified on important aspects. Channable offers a broad range of connections and the interface is quite intuitive, though a bit heavy. But everyone looking for this topic should be able to manage the level of complexity. Tested it and it took me less than 30 minutes to get a basic feed of ca. 300 product up and running. I have not activated any channel (test mode ends at that point), but if it is as easy as the above, time to market should be short. Please bear in mind you have to setup accounts and commercial agreements with any marketplace and price comparison sites you want to connect. That brings me to the pricing model, that offers different modules for different company sizes. I am looking at it with the eyes of a small shop that wants to scale distribution via marketplaces and comparison sites so for us ""Small Business"" and ""Medium Business"" would be relevant. In the smallest package with your website (1 language) and 500 products you're getting 3 connections to above mentioned third parties for 29€/M so ca. 350€/Y. The next (likely better) tier for small shops in growth hacking mode would be the Medium for 49€/M (588€/Y) allowing you to add 2 projects (so 1 shop in 2 languages or 2 shops in 1 language) with 6 channels. Fixed and transactional costs of third party channels e.g. Amazon would come on top depending on channel you want to connect. The packages include a one way product feed to the channels meaning your product information incl. price and stock levels are being sent to channels, however once an order is made this is not being fed back via an API to your system so orders won't bei integrated automatically, hence stock levels won't change. That is an Add-on called Order-Sync 49€/M (588€/Y), which you probably would want, as otherwise you would have to handle incoming orders from 3-6 channels (beyond 2 it's already a pain in peak season). So fair enough you've learned that you will probably pay something like 78-98 €/M or 936-1176 €/Y (not including fixed fees of third parties) to be in the channel management game, which is pretty much in the range of what you pay everywhere. What they don't tell you clearly enough on their page is, that will get an ""Hourly update"" of the feed included at that price level. An Addon that you normally have to pay for as the ""free"" alternative is only daily, which obviously is not an option at all. Imagine your stock levels being pushed to 6 channels/marketplaces are only updated once a day. So book your ""Order Sync"" module and you're fine! To sum up good tool with great functionalities and good value for money. For very small businesses I would rank Channable still a 3 out of 5 as I think the blank ""Starter Package"" is not alleviating the pains Small Business owners a going through."
"The recent updates to Shopify Flow have made it a much more comprehensive option for automation, with access to tons of variables and triggers as well as connections to many third party apps. The user experience has also been improved, giving it a clean and easy to use interface. Shopify Flow can be your virtual employee with an attention to detailed unrivaled by anyone."
"The new version of Flow is terrific - a huge improvement over the prior one. I am able to get much more granular with the field selections, and the flows themselves offer better complexity while keeping the interface simple."
"Fantastic app would highly recommend it. The interface is very easy to use, great invoice templates and fantastic customer service."
"Still early days with this app but liking it so far! Offers features that no other invoicing apps do - on a day to day basis we are printing well over 50 orders and many apps only pull from the order page.
Easy Invoice+ has an easy to use interface and dashboard that lets you download/print 100 orders at a time and has a search function that searches tags!! We struggled to find this elsewhere.
The support is 5 star, Paul was so helpful and super quick to resolve our problems. Thank you!"
"Awesome app! Amazingly simple, visual interface with so much potential. Functionality is a bit limited, but it's a brand new app. I have nothing but high hopes for the future of Flow!"
"A must have. This is one of the most professional app we found and use. For us it combined three main features by offering the option of pickup & delivery (as well as shipping) + date and time picker + rates by post code / zip code. Basically does the job of three different apps, but better. The interface is excellent, as well as the customer experience it provides. A logistical solution that we now swear by. On top of that, their customer service is absolutely fantastic! It comes with a free setup call and we had the pleasure to be helped by Marija who was extremely helpful by listening and understanding our needs. She set up the app for us in order for it to perform at its best for the logistical system of our business."
"Very easy to use, very suitable for novice shops！Simple operation, nice interface, no other plugins, fast loading and running！"
"UPDATE (March 13, 2022): Jan from Robin Pro connected with me and went the extra mile to help resolve a very hard-to-detect glitch that was out of his control involving Cloudfare (I don't even know what that is). Apparently the bug was specific to my region of North America and had nothing to do with this app. This kind of personalized service and determination speaks to me, and everything is up and running well. THANK YOU Jan. ~Jeremy ________________________________________________________________________
I really like the simplicity of this app. Unfortunately I consistently get intermittent images that won't load (I cleared cache several times and also experienced this on several browsers). Contacted the app maker and they've been very unresponsive, even after Shopify contacted them for me. Will continue looking for other apps. It's unfortunate because I do like the interface and the functionality."
"GERMAN
Die (mobile) Responsivität, die reibungslose Integration sowie das einfache Interface, machen diese App perfekt! Ich hatte einen Kundenwunsch - nämlich die Integration von URL-Links zu Bildern - welcher direkt und reibungslos durch Jan (Kundensupport) umgesetzt wurde! Ich benutze nun auf meiner Website an 5 Stellen die 100% responsiven Bild-Gallerien von Robin PRO. Danke!!!
ENGLISH
The mobile responsiveness, the frictionless integration of code as well as the easy and understandable interface make this app just perfect. I had a custom request: ""adding links to certain images"". This request was directly implemented through a very nice and fast customer-support (thanks to Jan!). Currently, I am using Robin PRO Image galleries on 5 sections on my website. Thanks a lot!"
"The app works great and has a very user-friendly interface. If you have any problems, the support is excellent."
The app has a good user interface and makes it very easy to transfer my photos. The developer did a great job!
"Great application, works perfectly and with a very nice interface. EXCEPTIONAL customer service EXCELLENT, responds very quickly and finds solutions to my requests. I still apologize to the developer if I send email after email, because it's my store and I want everything to work fast. I sincerely apologize for disturbing him because sometimes it's a holiday. In the end I am very happy with this application and also with their other application Log (I have both applications) and special mention especially of the customer service. Thanks again for your professionalism."
"The flexibility of this app is top notch. Image uploads from my photo album to my website is easier than it used to be. The app also has an easy to understand interface. Even if you do need help, the support is quick to respond."
"Tried the app and works fine. my site is still in testing phase though. When I tried to remove app, the registration which customer sees as first interface(I configured when using the app) is still there. Hope you can help."
"EDIT: This app is actually BETTER than Oberlo because it allows you to select and edit multiple variants at once. I'm loving it so far and I definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good Oberlo replacement. Since Oberlo migrated everything to that TERRIBLE new DSers app, I had to find a new AliExpress dropshipping app quickly. I spoke to Angel and she was so sweet and helpful, got me set up in a few minutes. I'm much, much happier with this app. It is a LOT more like Oberlo than DSers, a much more user-friendly and much cleaner interface."
"Linking to other platforms works great! Easy interface. If you need support, help is also provided quickly."
"This app is so easy to install and present on my website, also this team responded very quickly to my questions on how to improve user experience with this app. I believe this app will go popular very soon as both the product and the team are so nice. Expect more app and products from this developer. Good luck!"
"Poor help to set up this app! Why pay when you have to struggle to set it up? when I pay for a service I expect 99% of the problem solved, but with this up I feel like am putting 95% of work!!! I wouldnt recomend this app. Sorry guys.
When you offer a service to merchants like us make sure you have done all the hard work and charge all you want within reason. I give this 1/10.
Also when you list a contact number make sure you are available. I sens a chat and email message and offered to call using my phone or via Skype and was told we don't use Skype or make calls!
Here is the conversation below:

to me 
Hi Al,
We do not offer support via Phone or Skype call, sorry for that. Regarding your submission issue, for Cdiscount you'll have to use their online seller interface and perform a bulk upload with the generated data feed file as we're not currently offering API connection with Cdiscount. For Priceministe, the same, you can use the generated data feed file to perform a bulk upload via the priceminister merchants interface too. We're working to extend the API connection to other channels, including Priceminister and Cdiscount.
Please, let us know if you need further assistance.
Best regards,
Raül Navarro

Bellissima app che rende la user experience davvero grandiosa! consigliata per dare un tocco in piu al vosto sito!
Upsold has a great user interface. It is extremely easy to install and to create different offers tailored to your shops specific needs. The presentation of the pop ups are also nice and fit my stores theme which creates a create experience for my customers. Highly recommend!
This app is easy to download and navigate once you have done so. I’m just getting started with it but it has a much more user friendly interface and reporting than google.
"Their help chat personnel is very responsive and incredibly helpful for complex requests. We have had multiple niche requests and most if not all have been fulfilled. My only qualm, is that the User interface could use a bit of tweaking."
"This app is incredible. The User interface looks second to none, offers unlimited customization, and customer support is the best I've seen from any service since opening my store. To the people looking for a product customizer, look no further. To the developers and MyCustomizer team, job well done!"
"Was going to hire a developer for our site for a custom developed customizer but thought would try out the Shopify App Store first. Installed the top 6 apps in this customizer area and pretty much immediately uninstalled them all apart from this one! The user interface is easy, the logic rules and the support is insane! Was on a call with Jackie within 2 hours and she gave me a walkthrough and extra advice. I’m sure this app will have 1000’s of reviews over the next few years and be the leader in this space. I also run a Shopify design agency with over 200+ clients a month and will be recommending this app to all clients. Great job guys!!"
"This app has saved me hours and hours of dealing with indecisive customers that aren't sure what they want their custom product to look like. Now they can design it themselves and I don't need to get involved. The setup process has a bit of a learning curve, but if you know Photoshop (or someone who does) you can make a pretty amazing user experience with this app that saves time and makes money."
"By far one of my favorite apps on this platform. A must if you intend to make any sort of large scale changes on your catalog in a safe and efficient way. This has made everything from launching sales, to updating product barcodes a breeze for us. The app has a well thought out interface and set of features. I have saved so much time doing mundane updates."
We use this app across 3 stores and it's really great. Does exactly what we want it to and we feel the user experience with the pop up box is really good. Plus the customer service with the app is great. Highly recommended!
"I used this app to help me bulk edit the products' details with one click. I like it more than other apps because it has simple interface, easy to use, fast, and has free plan witch help me a lot to do all changes."
"Game changer app for theme deployment! Huge time saver, great user experience and support. The team is very helpful. Strongly recommended!"
"I tried out this app the interface looks like it's from the 90s and it wouldn't do anything on my page, i was looking for a quick solution to add an accordion to the page. Definitely not userfriendly."
"Absolutely perfect to edit product description html in bulk! Exactly what we needed! Intuitive interface, just great!"
"This is a beautifully-written app which offers a very high quality user experience, with great results.   Truly a star-performer.  Thank you to the developers.    UPDATE: I have just used this app again and I just have to tell you that I am VERY, VERY grateful.  It is MARVELLOUS :)"
"It's probably the 10th app I tried for bulk editing the products and it's the best one so far because of the user interface. It does what it says on the box without fancy bells and whistles. The only thing I would like to see in such an app is to see all the products underneath each other with their attributes (price, sku, title, etc.) and have the ability to change stuff in that window. Like a spreadsheet but within the app. The changes don't have to be in real time but I'd like to see all items in a spreadsheet. This app has something similar to that which is why I like it."
"Good interface, easy to use, great support! They quickly addressed our issue regarding file uploads and quickly patched an update to fix a bug that causes the problem. Recommended!"
We have been using the Store as IDP-SSO Login for the last 5 months and have been very happy with how they have enabled us to connect our shopify store with thinkific. Their team is super supportive and responsive and have always been very quick with troubleshooting and are always happy to hear our thoughts about product enhancements as well that would enable a better user experience for our users.
"Love that there is a free version that does what I need it too! The interface is a little confusing, but overall I'm satisfied."
Excellent App for Etsy Integration. It is designed with a very logical user interface. A delight to use!
"We recently started using this app and so far it is exactly what we were looking for! Very easy user interface and quick, helpful customer service makes this app easy to use. We love the instagram integration and being able to sort through our tagged photos!"
"Great service so far from the dev. Hopefully, it speeds up our user experience and I'm looking for to have an app experience."
"BY FAR the best PWA app out there! 
Amazing customer service! friendly, helpful, and understand your needs with ease with a very fast response rate. Super easy to configure! Best interface Ive seen!"
"Socialphotos team are beyond amazing. They are an absolute pleasure to work with, responsive and went above and beyond to make sure I was happy with Socialphotos. 
Many companies can learn a thing or two about great customer service from these guys. Socialphotos is absolutely fantastic. We tried other apps and none seamlessly integrated with Shopify like Socialphotos, which is critical for a great user experience. Socialphotos is like magic and we could not be happier. 
In fact, we could not launch our store without it. I recommend this app and the people behind it as highly as any customer could ever recommend anyone."
"Faced several UI issue on mobile interface, and Khushbu and her team was very responsive in replying and getting the problem fixed. Loving this app very much! Thanks team!!"
This app allows you to team up with a manufacturing team that truly cares about you. They have an amazing interface to create your brand as you display in your head. Top of the line support team as well!! 110% recommended
"The only app which allows full user experience and its accessibility is very convenient especially to those who have zero knowledge on coding.
This app is much recommended and you not only enjoy its functions but also friendly customer service who are there to help you around."
"The product design interface leaves a bit to be desired but the customer service has been great! Erin worked late on Friday to correct some images for me, which was a big help"
This app helps us take existing inventory and build bundles. Bundles are great because it helps customers visualize options of combos we recommend. Customer service by Harold is outstanding. Very helpful and speedy replies. The new app interfaces are intuitive and easy to use.
"Very fast support! I had a little problem (the timer displayed only on the product page) but I contacted them and resolved my issue in minutes!
Exellent graphics, and interface: 200% satisfied!!"
The app manages the product perfectly and Gazebo is really good at solving all problems in a timely manner. The new interface also lets me manage the bundle easily! Love it!
The user interface is ugly and very small: it also has a few bugs with the customization menus. Not worth charging 7 bucks a month imo...
A very simple but great app. Together with Stocky Bundles it made it possible for us to track recipies and products in order to comply with the health authorities. Harold has listened to our requests and the fifth star is for the new interface coming soon with some new and important functionality. App is straightforward and works seamlessly.
Top! Wir sind sehr zufrieden. Haben bereits unsere zweite Kampagne geplant. Sehr übersichtlich und verständliches Interface
"poor user experience, app does not work inside Shopify, no onion to order samples, they just want you to start selling and trust that their product are worthy of our customers.  thumbs down"
"I downloaded every app in the app store looking for one that would autofulfill bundles for me, split into line items, and not double shipping weights, while calculating inventory accurately and let me tell you - THIS IS THE ONLY ONE. IT'S THE ONLY ONE THAT WORKS. Harold, the developer, is a godsend. I sent him and email about the feature I would like to see, he coded it and had it up in the app in 3 days with personalized communication the whole time. If you have any questions, he is so helpful, and if there's a feature you don't see in the very simple interface, like the line items splitting in orders, he will just add it for you. You just need to accept some access permissions and send him an email. THANK YOU HAROLD. 100% hands down recommend."
"Things I love about this app: #1. Harold, the developer, is extremely responsive. He responds within the day, always. And if changes are possible, he makes them for you just as quickly. If you have been a Shopify store-owner for a while, you know this responsiveness is one of the most important ""features"" of any app. #2. The app does what it says it will do. All of our products are basically ""bundles"", since they combine various raw materials. So, we use this app to be able to track all the component materials' inventory correctly. Plus, there's a bulk import feature, which is huge for shops like us who have 1000's of bundles. #3. Straightforward and easy-to-use interface. #4. Integrates with Stocky. Things I'd like to see: #1. Some sort of UI that makes it easier to navigate for shops like us that have 1000's of bundles. And a change to the bulk import feature so that it will ""update"" existing bundles. (sidenote: I have reached out to Harold about these and it seems like these are on the roadmap) #2. Stocky doesn't accurately calculate the bundle cost. It should be based on the bundle components. For some reason, this isn't working. I think this is more Stocky's fault than the Bundles app."
"We create our first campaign a few days ago  The usability and overview is great! The app interface is sort of guided. Suggested campaigns, a very good sorted sidebar and of course relevant to your industry influencer suggestions are just great! The Influencer analysis give's you some inside data about relevant details like Conversion rates, average likes per post, countries of influence, real followers... So, no MediaKit needed. The 5th Star is for the cooperation options between Merchants/Producers/Retailers & the Influencers. We have the feeling that the guys from Linkr know what they do.
Besides that, they have a really friendly and pro active support for anyone who still needs some support. We totally recommend this app & are really surprised by how cool this works! Alex, from MontOlympe Natural Cosmetics"
"Linkr has helped us reach out to International Influencers we normally wouldn’t be able to connect with and helped create long term working relationships with them. The platform seamlessly integrates all aspects of driving Social Marketing Campaign, by sourcing Influencers, shipping sample products, and issuing payment. Its simple interface lets you easily monitor the progress of a campaign and communicate with Influencers directly. The support team took care of any questions that arose and were very helpful in making sure we were able to get our message across that was unique to our brand."
"Wow. Just wow. Maybe because I live in the land of social media where there is absolutely nobody to help you when things go wrong, I am absolutely blown away by the customer service of Shirly from shopUpz. I had a few false starts of my own making once I added this app. Which is particularly silly because the app is pretty straight forward in what it offers to do as well as the user interface AND I am usually a reasonably detail oriented person but for whatever reason the stars did not align right out of the gate for me on this one. Never fear! Shirly not only patiently answered my questions via an Etsy chat, when we found we couldn't resolve the issue in a expedited manner, she hopped on a Zoom call to resolve with me. This app does exactly what I need. No more, no less. Plus, I feel completely confident that if I have any questions or hiccups they will be taken care of quickly and effectively. You really can't ask for more."
"Had high hopes for this one with the great product selection, but the poor interface and ridiculous shipping & handling times make it unusable. 100% of orders were printed late and with longer shipping times than the estimated window. Combine that with packages not arriving or being returned to sender with zero assistance from viralstyle to figure out why or hold the printers accountable, and you get a load of pissed off customers and headaches for days."
"This is by far one of my favorite apps. It does everything I need it to without a confusing interface. The price is great too! But the best feature of all is the support, they will listen and work with you! Can't recommend enough!"
Conversion % of this app is absolutely best compared to other upsell apps we have tried. Candy Cart is currently making 50% of our sales and I think that is awesome. Very well designed app and the user experience is seamless. Customer service 10/10.
Easy to build pages because the user experience and the interface is amazing. Customer service is also 10/10 and super fast to respond! :)
I use shogun to get a visual of what I'm looking for as a final product and its ease of usability when creating a better interface.
"I like everything. A good application and it's good that you can increase or decrease the tariff plan depending on the quantity of goods and the place. It was difficult for me to find an application for my large volume. And this is completely fine. When I could not understand something, the responsive support service solved my questions and helped me find what I was looking for. I also liked the interface. There are many features that are not available in the standard application."
Wonderful App. I need Recently Viewed and I found it. Nice and easy to use. All what I need - I have. Just what really need to add - it is padding setting to interface that everyone can change it by self (distance between name of section and picture) like Image ration You have - it is wonderful setting. Great Cudtomer Service - Bow and Thank You very much from all my atoms. You do nice work. Wish You good luck and grow and billions of users))) hehehehhe
"I am new to e-commerce web page development, and I highly recommended DISQUS. The app is fantastic, and the user interface is very accessible to my customers. Tech support is GREAT! They respond very quickly and know their stuff. They will help you along the way until you are satisfied. Can not recommend enough A++"
Wonderful App. Excellent User interface. Brilliant Customer support. Go for it for your GST invoicing needs.
"You NEED to know that SellersDash has given the BEST Support ever experienced in 4+ years on Shopify and working with many App developers. Next, this App is a MUST HAVE if you sell Designs on T-Shirts, garments and other gear, especially if using a POD supplier like Customcat, Printful, Printify, etc. Once you understand how it works and setup your products as needed, it's a Pure Joy to see Products have every Style, Color, and Size you want without the Shopify limit of only 100 variants per product. As a Shop owner, this App has answered many prayers for what it does and can do. My catalog and collections are no longer cluttered with repeated products just to give my customers different garment styles and options to choose from. And it is so EASY to use as the App interface is clean, crisp, and concise without unnecessary bells and whistles that get in the way. If you have an issue or encounter a problem, just send an email. In my experience I've had a REAL response within 24 hours. Never has it been ""Thanks for contacting us, we'll get back soon."" They get on it immediately. Finally, I would suggest to have SellersDash install the App for you IF you are not familiar with your Theme and with making edits to underlying Liquid Code. If that doesn't make sense, then you need to have them do it, lol. Want to see the magic of this App in action? Then visit my store at MyTeeFunny.com and browse a product or two. Pardon the mess though, it's still under construction as I changed to a new Theme just before discovering this App a couple of weeks ago... This App is worth EVERY Penny and then some. I promise and guarantee it!"
"We have used Orderhive for some time now to handle our order management and fulfillment. It is a solid tool with great customer support. Orderhive brings together shopify and all of our other selling platforms into one interface which is great for analysis and fulfillment. One of the best features is its ability to ""break bundles"" that come from Shopify - in other words you can define a SKU in shopify that is actually a collection of other SKUs and Orderhive will recognize that and when you fulfill pull in each SKU that is part of the collection or bundle - not many tools do this well and its the main reason we started using Orderhive to begin with."
Love this app!   The interface is similar to my homepage customizer with all of the same sections I already know.   I asked for a couple of simple customizations and they made them for free!   They also gave me a great price on some advanced customizations.   And they have first-rate customer support!
"Very, very easy app to setup and control, leave it running with minimal effort. Excellent. The interface is really simple but very intuitive and effective. Integrates very well with Shopify. Install this app and save yourself a lot of time!!!!"
"We have been using this app for 2 stores (soon to be 3) and overall it's been excellent! It's not cheap but for all of the functionality that's to be expected and tech support has been very helpful. I tried 2 other inventory management programs before this and had demos for a couple more and the user interface, automation, and flexibility are the best. Also, we needed to sell bundle products (a 4 pack of the same item) and after evaluating a ton of apps we discovered we could do this easily through Orderhive!"
"ChannelSale is a professional marketplace that provides the best integration software services. Very communicative and ready to go the extra mile for each and every customer. Excellent customer service, a simple to use interface, a stable platform, and a kind staff."
great service from help desk when support was needed. Easy to use interface that is similar to shopify menu structure
"Nous utilisons cette application pour gérer nos retours produit. La mise en place est simple, on s'y retrouve facilement dans l'interface, et il y a de nombreuses options pour adapter le processus de retours à nos besoins. En plus, l'équipe support est très réactive et à l'écoute."
Great user interface and customer service. Aftership Returns Center has allowed us to manage our return and exchange as well as refund policy in a seamless way.
"I had some doubts and they assisted me in seconds solving the problem immediately. I recommend it, in addition to the fact that the interface is very intuitive"
I attempted to set this up to replace Return Magic since they're shutting down. After four days of work and endless error messages later I gave up. The basic user experience (I'm talking log-ins that sent me on loops back to the app store) was a Kafkaesque nightmare. The support team was less equipped to solve the issue than I was. I'm a pretty technically savvy person and this would be impossible for someone who isn't.
App developer is genius cause he can achieve everything i want. But a small suggestion is that you can optimize your app user interface because people may have very specific need. Hope you can do better.
Excellent support. Live chat available directly within the app and they were able to help me solve a small issue right away. The interface is very easy to use and the app is well designed.
"Je recommande cette application à tous les e-commerçant ! L'interface qui apparaît sur le site est complètement épurée et rends mon site vraiment professionnelle. Le SAV est toujours à l'écoute, et son utilisation est vraiment facile (quasiment intuitif). Je la recommande !"
"Awesome and clean cut, nice user experience and great customer service team too - highly recommended!"
"5 stars simply for the exceptional customer service! I have been through multiple product customisation apps and by far this is the best for 3 main reasons; 1. User-friendly, 2. Great interface, 3. and again EXCEPTIONAL customer service. Highly recommend!"
Amazing App! Love the interface and the template designs. Its a must have for every Facebook advertiser.
"I saw the ad on Instagram and immediately booked a demo as I had been looking for a suitable budget-friendly upsell Shopify app for months. During the demo, not only did Dhruv show me how the app looked on a demo store and how the interface of the dashboard looked, he even helped me set up my first funnel right on the call! As a Shopify Partner with their own Shopify store, it's important to have a solution that not only works for my business but also my clients; AfterSell is that solution. Quick Stats: User Interface Design: 5 Stars
App Connectivity: 5 Stars
Learnability of App: 5 Stars
Implementation: 5 Stars
Integrations: 5 Stars
Customer Service: 5 Stars
Pricing = Flexible: 5 Stars If you're still on the fence, book a demo and see for yourself if you think this would be a good fit for your store. They'll even help you set up your first funnel and publish. 10/10 would recommend!"
"Nice Easy To Use Interface, Easy To Pick And Order The Icons. Great Icon Quality, Overall Great App And Very Usefull."
"Just bought this , seems to work , I am embedding Youtube. I have the same gripe with this as the audio player, no volume control !?
Also the play button does not work to start a video unless its already been started with the youtube play button which is confusing.
                      ****Responding to answer****
Basically you are saying that an app that plays sound does not need a volume control...makes no sense , not everyone is browsing on a phone.
Why do ALL other sites that play audio have an Volume control ?
 I never touch the main volume of my audio interface , i set the volume on each playing app , should without a doubt be an option."
Amazing and fast customer support. Very easy to use interface. We are now doing changes on the live website without worrying because backups and change history is covered by Rewind. Highly rerecorded.
"We were looking for a product that helped us make great looking tables that were easily navigable by customers - and this product fits the bill. The import feature made it quick to upload existing documents and the system itself is fairly intuitive. The only downside with the interface was that it required CSS knowledge, which we don't have. This is where the great customer service comes in - Chandni in their support team helped us no end in getting the table settings just right. For US$1.99 per month i can thoroughly recommend the app."
Very easy to use and very simple interface. Love this! The app you hope you never have to use! Set up is seamless and you can access your regular backups whenever. from withgear
"Hello, I was looking forward on using this app, as it promised easy to use interface. However I'm not able to log in and the customer service isn't responding on my issue since 5 days. If you (Stuff) read your reviews more often, then please reply to me with a solution. I already paid for the service but can't use it. Thank you (will change rating once I can use the app)"
"This app has been brilliant for allowing us to both customise and bulk print our packing slips, it also allows us to pull in extra information such as the delivery and collection date. Very user-friendly interface and the support team are amazing; super helpful and a very quick response time. Particular thanks to Diego and David. Highly recommend!"
"We like this app better than the most reviewed multivendor marketplace app out there. Here is why: - The interface is times cleaner, simpler and easier to understand.
- The loading time when switching between sections is shorter.
- The configurations are less and more direct.
- It's cheaper. What we miss
- Ability for making a shop page for each vendor. This made us think twice.
- Ability to translate messages that are automatically emailed to vendors and buyers.
- Several options for messages that are emailed automatically to vendors and buyers. Reason why we give 5 stars even tho it does less at the moment is because it does it better and it looks better.
Great job, we appreciate your work and thanks for putting it out there."
"If you like HIGHER conversion rates and LOWER customer service email inquiries, then you will LOVE Maisie. I have installed several chatbots and none of them came close to the results we have gotten with Maisie. Maisie not only provides one of the most intuitive chatbots (from backend design to user experience) but also top notch customer service. The ability to design different flows for different pages (product pages, cart pages, etc.) has increased our conversion rate tremendously. Our Maisie Bot has helped our customers quickly find answers to their questions, leading them to a more confident buying decision while significantly decreasing the number of customer service emails that require a human to answer. 10/10 would recommend… You will not be disappointed with Maisie!"
"Great App to quickly remove the background of your photos! Very friendly interface, easy to handle App. If necessary, allows to correct a background manually by given tools. Different backgrounds and slight correction of photos are also possible.
Awesome customer service - very fast and extremely friendly. Effectively helped with the proper initial installation of the App."
"Only used for a small batch of ""wholesale"" customers who need accounts to see our discounted pricing. It seems to have worked so far, nice simple interface that does what I hoped for.  Would be nice to have an HTML email preview window when loading the messages."
Great support and great team. There are still some user experience kinks to sort out but otherwise it has been a great experience using the App.
I've been using this app for a while now and it works extremely well and displays nicely on my product pages. The interface to make the badges is a little clunky but nothing that can't be overcome. The support team is also highly responsive and helps with any style issues I've run into. I definitely recommend this app!
"One of the best apps I've used on Shopify. Helpfull, fast support. Fantastic and detailed documentation, easy to use interface and plenty of options to configure many banners, badges and calls to action. Also very easy to install. 100% recommend."
"Here's an app that is complete and clean, the developers have taken their time to build something very advanced with a simple user friendly interface. Like most Shopify app developers, support is on another level, they care about your business and your feedback! When compared features with similar apps you will see how Prime Badges comes on top. Special thanks to Tanmay for being so patient!"
"This app is good for the landing page. It would be nice if it did user experience better, not easy to use."
"This is hands down the best app for building bundles. It's great that you can create:
1. Bundles as their own page
2. Add bundles to a product page Super easy to create bundles to increase AOV. I havent tried anything wild with this app, but I was able to set up a nice leash + collar + dog tag combo where all 3 items were required, but the dog tags could be swapped out. I like how you can make a product swappable with any other product in a collection. Worked really well for the dog charms. The default front-end style is the cleanest I've seen, and the developer has added a place to add custom stylesheets/javascript that you can load with the app. The back-end admin interface is really well designed and works like a charm."
"I was looking for a bundle builder type app that had some flexibility, yet was compact enough to display on (almost) every product page. Tier has just that. The SWAP feature is a game changer and works really well. The interface is intuitive, and support is fast, friendly, and helpful. Currently on the Essential plan but will need to upgrade to Pro soon as I'm adding more products that will benefit from the swappable bundles. Yay!"
I don't love the interface if I am honest and due to a breakdown in communication at the start of the year (they didn't explain what the implications of removing an old channel was!) we have lost ALL of our historical communication with customers HOWEVER I would still recommend this app. CS is great and they usually sort stuff out pretty quickly.
"I have been using Wiio's service, the interface is very easy to use and they always provide great service, before and after sales! thumbs up!"
"From the surface Pixels can offer your business a lot of value and ease of use for a print service. But the reality is once you use it for almost a year and see hardly any return on sales, accompanied by losing money over shipping/payment integration issues. followed by everything mentioned below on my cons list. its not worth it. Long Story Short If you are a Fine Art Photographer or looking for a professional looking website with access for clients to purchase High quality prints directly from your site using a 3rd party print lab Run away from this one..
Pros:
-Only app that will work with sopify store for the above use.
-lots of product selections
Cons:
-25MB File Size maximum (red Flag #1)
-Payment Integration is a nightmare
-Display Images of  your FINE ART you want people to BUY with money on your website looks HORRIBLE. and I mean awful compared to the Full Size Image File. (this is more of a Shopify issue but none the less its a HUGE problem)
-for correct Shipping Calculations to be determined on orders (Pixels wont mention this part), you have to Purchase and Install ANOTHER 3rd party shopify plugin (advanced shipping Rules) that does this for you. Thuss making overhead go up, and the value of pixels go Down..oh and if thats not bad enough you have to pay for the entire Year upfront of shopify service just for the advance shipping app to work with pixels properly. so now even if I want to stop using pixels/shopify I wont be able to get that money back. (Huge Bummer)
-user support for this service is horrible
-User Interface (UI) is not great and often times confusing.
-claims to have lots of frame options but on my site it would only allow B&W frame/Matting options.
-uploading new Content to put on your site is time consuming.
-Prices are not any better than its competition
 I do recommend that you check out the company PixieSet, They offer Website building,Professional Client Proofing service, a Store that works with 4 different labs you can offer your clients. and much more. I just started with them on a Free account and so far my its so much better than what Shopify/pixels can offer your photography business."
This app blows away the previous app I was using. Very intuitive interface and the emails look absolutely beautiful.
"We are giving this app a five star review after a few months of testing it out. It offers prompt shipping, an easy to use interface and the flexibility to create a unique store within Shopify.  The quality of the art prints is exceptional, a crucial element to our design business. That said, we did have a few early issues setting up the store, but the support from Pixels is fantastic. Alex answered all our questions and made sure we are happy customers."
"Best app till now, easy interface, to the point features, best support, everything is best till now as compared to other apps. I am saying this after 4 months of use"
The interface and features look good. For now there seem to be some bugs but the devs is fixing them quickly. I will update the review once the app seems flawless.
Have used this app for over 2 weeks now...its working perfectly well..simple to use interface..and good customer service
"nice and helpful! 
yet there is space for improvement in terms of interface and buttons."
"nice and helpful!
yet there is space for improvement in terms of interface and buttons."
"very good support and feedback, solved my questions very rapidly. interface is fine and intuitive.."
"Robust features, excellent interface and terrific customer support. We recently migrated to Stamped.io after using Yotpo for 2+ years and couldn't be happier. While not cheap, the customer support and set of features we receive on the platform far exceeds that received on Yotpo for a similar price point. The switch between platforms was easy and I encourage any merchant using Yotpo to do the same!"
I have just switched from Judge me to Stamped.io. I have been doing lots of research and app comparisons and Stamped.io is definitely the best. The interface is quite easy to use and lots of customizable features on the free plan. Easy review migration (just 1 min) and nice that I can customize the email and widget making it in line with my store colours and font. The customer service team - Ashok is really helpful and replies to emails promptly and giving solutions and advices. Also the speed of the store has not been affected at all. Highly recommended.
"Great app and excellent support from the developers. I really like the interface of the app, which has enough good features even in its free version."
Really easy to use and clean interface. Everyone can handle and understand how it works right away. Very well done guys! Thanks!
"Great app. Just stop looking at others, and get this one. It's worth it. We downloaded and tried several other menu apps, but this one has the most features and it's so easy to set up and use. There are so many options and ways you can build an instant menu - so much better than the stock standard Shopify settings. Once you understand the Smart Mega Menu interface you can drag and drop and change things instantly. Just check you have your collections and products ready to go. We now use this app in both our Shopify Stores - both have different looks and functions. Both work great. So stop looking and download this one. It actually works and is worth it."
"I highly recommend this app. This app allows you to display related products on the product page and add them to customer cart as add ons/upgrades. The add ons need to be their own product. I tried many different add on apps and I found this to be the best value + the interface is really easy to navigate. The app is very well thought out and resolved. The customer service is unbeatable. I had some specific requirements I needed and Shipra and Ganesh were incredibly helpful and responsive. They went above and beyond what was reaquired and the result is I have an app that is working exactly how I need it. Thank you Shipra and Ganesh, you're doing a fantastic job."
"I like the setting interface of this background very much, and the customer service answers are very enthusiastic. Also suggested me what needs to optimize the place, I feel very practical. I am very satisfied with this APP."
"Everything is working great so far, user interface is smooth and intuitive, and the customer support has been very responsive and helpful!"
"Ive used a few other apps for campaigns, pop ups and email marketing but Flowio is the best experience Ive had by far! Great service, easy interface and the flow is so straight forward. Definitely recommend!"
"We were looking for a simple & robust website polling tool and Zigpoll was perfect for that. Functionally it works well - has site/audience targeting & poll design customisation, allows switching between multiple Shopify stores on the interface, language localisation, and poll results exports. The team was very responsive, open to taking in & implementing key feature requests, & pricing is very reasonable too."
"I just setup this app yesterday. It was super easy to figure out. I set up a quick survey to see how my users navigated the website, and gave them a discount code for filling out the survey. Then today I set up an email collection. Integration with MailChimp was as easy as copying my API key from Mailchimp and pasting it into a field in the Zigpoll settings area. I'm currently using 2 other methods of collecting user data or having engagement. I think I really like Zigpoll better than either of the others. The user interface is pretty easy to figure out and if you are at a loss of what to do, the examples on the Zigpoll website will surely get you pointed in the right direction."
"If you want to get feedback from your customers Zigpoll is the perfect way to do it. The interface is clean and easy to use as the creator and the user. It is easy to theme all the elements to match your branding and most importantly it provides you with data on the back end so that you can gain more insights about your customers on top of the survey/poll questions. We used it to run a voting contest but I know there are many more ways to use Zigpoll in the future. Support for any problems was also fast and clear. Truly if you want a tool that helps you get survey data, polls, or user feedback from people coming to your site just install Zigpoll it is an amazing tool."
This is the only app that respects the user experience. The joke today is that you spend more time closing pop ups than browsing e-commerce websites. Zigpoll breaks that pattern by allowing you to communicate with your customers unobtrusively. Highly recommend for those who don’t want to cheapen their brands.
Love this! Easy installation and beautiful interface
"I am changing my review from 4 to 2 stars.
I have a PRO account and I'm paying $13 per month. I wouldn't complain if this was actually FREE.
I reported a bug months and months ago and I keep being told that it's going to be resolved shortly. I can not access the web interface from Google Chrome. I receive this error on a blank screen:
Bad Accept-Language header value: 'en-US,en;q=0.8,es;q=0.6,es-419;q=0.4'"
Excellent app and customer service. The user interface is really good and the team will help you through if you have any question for installing/ customizing the code somewhere on your website
Easy to use interface and rapid customer service. Jason set me up instantly (not that set-up is necessary!) and directed me to their examples page for inspo! Very grateful and a great addition to my store. Love that you can customise the zigpoll icon to colours of your choosing. All the best.
"I really love the ease of use of the app! it makes keeping my square inventory connected with my shopify inventory seamless and smooth; the integration and interface are super simple and easy to understand and use. this app makes my busy life just that much easier, and that way i can better serve my patrons!"
"This app has honestly saved me from pulling my hair out over inventory syncing and discrepancies. Running a small business is definitely a challenge, especially when running it across two platforms. Squarify has helped me sync up and keep track of our entire inventory, ensuring that everything online + in store is live and accurate. Not only is it an easier interface that other syncing app's I've tried, but their custom service is reliable and dedicated. With any issue or confusion, they've been quick to respond and answer all my questions–and they follow-up as well to make sure everything ended up a-okay. Seriously cannot thank or recommend Squarify enough!!!"
"Pros: Intuitive and easy user interface to design products. The representative product images look professional. It's simple to adjust pricing and publish. Cons: you need to preview each product (ie. if you are making phone cases, you need to view all 50 models of phone case. eg. iPhone XS, iPhoneXS Max, iPhone 11....) as the image does not resize on all as you would think."
Easy to use interface for making cards and excellent customer support from Ed. I will definitely be creating many more products using this app!
"I use this for all my landing pages, especially for ads. The only thing I don't love is some of the inability to change the user interface and look of certain widgets."
"Awesome little App, Very easy to use. Probably too simple! Interface is crispy and clean, slick looking. Professional Finished Product, for free in minutes. Excellent little APP :)"
Easily to use app! Highly recommended for its customisable features and user-friendly interface for customers! Thanks for the app.
"UPDATED REVIEW (Originally 1/5): Initial setup was a large hassle due in part to unreliable communication with customer service drawn out over the course of three weeks. However, once you get past the setup, the shipping interface is unbelievably simple and the real-time updates make it about as easy as humanly possible for your customers. So far, worth the trouble it takes to get it off the ground."
Very convenient and easy to use. Recently I started using it and I was very pleased.Simple and intuitive interface
"Great Customer Service, Buddy personally called and walked me through my 1st International Shipment with InXpress. Fast and courteous.  I would like to see and update where you would be able to make and process international labels / AWB# from within the Shopify interface with that is all possible. Other than that, Great app guys!
darqmatterdesign"
The perfect app for adding size charts of all kinds to your shopify site. The interface is easy to use and you can add your own images and styling to the charts. Jon was also extremely helpful with customising our product page. Highly recommended to all shopify users!
Excellent and easy to use. Look forward to getting more results with the team here. Great user interface
Wish links weren’t always broken to turn ads on and off. Nice interface. We will see if this is at all beneficial to my business. Wish I could easily change the PPC
"A difficult interface at first. hard to understand what you're actually changing as you go. I'm having problems changing font colors on my cart which should be pretty easy. Also, when I try to enter my main site using the protected password nothing happens. Will probably cancel before the free trial expires"
Very simple and easy to use. Clean interface and clean minimal look. Has everything you need to stave off the boss!  Customer service is excellent.
"I just installed this app. Don't know how it work, but the interface look very friendly, hopefully it's work well, relief headache deal with google"
"I wanted to add a short video to the landing page of my website. This app was absolutely perfect! It was easy to get my video set-up, clear interface. Great customer service too! Thanks for making such a great app ^^"
"Super solution vidéo pour garantir une meilleur visibilité auprès des visiteurs. Interface simple, efficace sans besoin de coder! En + le support technique est juste au top, rapide et très sympathique. Hâte qu'on la teste sur la longue durée!"
"Great support and always respond back to questions
Love this platform, has a very easy to use user interface making creating campaigns super quick and easy. Not to mention there's also a loyalty points program! Everyone on the team is amazing and super helpful with providing me with tips to help me maximize my use out of the app and maximize sales through Marsello. Absolutely love this app. Hard to change to something else once you've started since it's so great!"

"Love Marsello! Customer loyalty is the main reason my business has succeeded, which is only possible with this app. Easy interface to use and great team when technical questions arise."
"We first started using the app and everything was perfect, amazing interface super easy to integrate into our store. After a couple of months we noticed that the videos were not playing properly. We emailed the support team at vidjet and within 12 hours they responded and had our issue fixed! Amazing Customer service and product!!"
"absolutely awesome app. user friendly, a butt load of features, surprisingly great interface. can't believe this isn't promoted more."
Only just getting to grips with this app but so far loving it! Completely intuitive drag and drop interface that has allowed us to fully customize our invoices and packing slips and print to the same integrated despatch labels as other platforms we sell across. Customer support so far has been fantastic. Would not hesitate to recommend.
"An excellent app! It has allowed us to customize our receipts/invoices to meet our business' aesthetic! The design interface is simple and easy to use! 
We needed to show the amount used from a gift card on our receipts. Customer service is so helpful and quick-- we received a response to the question that day! Tanel got together with the Shopify team and within a day was able to add this functionality {total_gift_card_amount}.
We absolutely love this app and couldn't be more pleased!"
"Such a great app !
Very easy to install and use. 
Everything we need to make our  barcode system, receipts ans invoices.
Very clean and well structured interface. 
Tanel from customer service has been very helpful. 
We had an issue, asked for advice and he fixed it straightway.
We are very happy with this app and can highly recommend it !"
"Great app. The default templates are good but it takes a little bit of time to get familiar with the interface and customize it. It will be even more helpful if the App Dev can include template for common paper sizes (i.e. both A4 and Letter) instead of just A4.
This app saves us a lot of effort in printing packing slips and sales invoices in our fulfillment flow. Best part of all is it's FREE. Keep up the good work!"
"Such an awesome app! Amazing flexibility that has allowed us to add everything we need on our receipts/invoices! We love the design interface-- we were able to move around our logo and the text to have everything in the right spot! 
And to top it all off, the customer service is so helpful-- we received a response to a question within minutes! 
Absolutely love this app-- couldn't be more happy!"
I was in need of a solution that would allow customers to make a partial payment to reserve a custom product. Globo's Pre-Order app was perfect and allowed me to customize the features to what I needed. I did run into an issue during checkout test process because I had custom flat rate shipping defined. I reached out to Globo for help and they immediately went to work and resolved the issue for me. Sarah from Globo was great to interface with and kept me up to date with the resolution.
"Really nice app, super easy to use, tons of cool ways to collect people's messenger, nice interface, and one-click implementation works really well :) 
Good job team!"
"App worked great straight from the beginning! Allowed us to have a much nicer customer interface for our customers. We encountered minimal issues, which were all fixed super quickly. Highly Recommend!"
"We use the advanced account profile, store credit app and referral for our store. It works great and integrates with Klaviyo to automate a lot of the notifications and bring customers back for repeat orders. The team is very supportive and have helped us multiple times to make customisations to improve the user experience based on our business needs. Great product and great team!"
"This app is not fit for purpose with many bugs in the interface, missing key order/shipping management features and insufficient inputs for successful overseas shipping. I sent a bag of EU parcels to test the service and was assured all measures were in place to ensure parcels from Northern Ireland did not have customs duties and taxes applied in the EU as is correct under the NI protocol and OSS VAT system. Twelve days after posting and only those parcels sent within Ireland have arrived, the rest either lost or having erroneous customs duties and taxes applied which our customers will need to pay to receive their order then appeal with their customs authority. I can't access key parcel information after shipping and Mule's own customer service have incorrectly insisted there should indeed be customs duties and taxes to the EU from NI. Very concerning that a UK shipping service would have such a lack of understanding of current customs arrangements."
This is a simple to use app with a stylish interface that makes it easy for my customers to manage their subscriptions. Some bugs came up during an upgrade that customer service was quick to fix. Thank you
Great support and beautiful interface. Got my issues rectified within a day. It will be great if there are future updates that allow more customisation and addition of more 3rd party apps/widgets.
"Great app to customize your users account interface, very flexible, intuitive and support is great when you need any assistance!"
Great App - very easy user interface! I expect this solution to help recover loads of abandoned carts!
"This app is exactly what you want it to be... and everything you need it to be. I search app after app look for the best USER EXPERIENCE and customer friendly apps to build a trustworthy brand. Recart, is simple to use and the support is consultant level support. You dont feel like your talking to Tusken Raiders. You feel like your talking to knowledgeable people that care about their success and yours."
"Exactly what I was looking for. Great user interface and great customer service. Kinda pricey, but worth it for the size of our site."
"best and one of the most essential apps for anyone who likes to run a shopify store. app has a very user-friendly interface and everything is done true few easy clicks. the customer support is super perfect and they reply fast and will help you kindly in case of any issues, dont miss this app, make sure to try it!"
"It is a best app through the whole shopify app store. It is a mast have Number 1 app that everyone should have on their stores. The app itself, the support and interface are more than 5 star! Thank you very much Ankit, Milind and Shiny. You are doing great job wish you success!"
We are very happy with our experience with Flits! They have been extremely responsive (within 24 hours) and helpful in assisting us with uploading the app onto our website. They have made the process extremely easy! And the interface of the app has been a wonderful addition to our business. We would highly recommend Flits! Great job!
This is a great app! Installed easily/quickly without any problems. Definitely improves the shopping experience for our repeat customers. We needed a slight modification to the Reorder interface and they got it updated within a day... Excellent service!!
"Amazing customer support! Only a small percentage of my total store orders require sending proofs. I used the customer support chat box to message support about only paying for a plan based on how many proofs I send out - not how many total orders my store gets. Within seconds Nick (customer support rep) began working on creating filters to only send certain orders into the dashboard, and changing my plan so that it only counts these specific orders (not my total store orders). 10/10 would recommend if you are doing any type of custom orders & designs for your customers. Did I mention it is VERY EASY to use and is a much better user experience for your customers?? It also brings customers to your site to review their mock-ups. Stop emailing customers your proofs and manage the process through this app."
"Très bonne application. Les vidéos augmentent l'engagement client et facilite les ventes. Mise en ligne des vidéos facile, interface intuitive.
Le service client top et très réactif. Merci à Leo et Baptiste pour votre Travail.
Je recommande ++++++"
"Dans l'optique constante d'améliorer notre UX, suite à la refonte de notre site internet sur Shopify, nous avons intégrés la solution Vidjet. Nous sommes très satisfaits du résultat. Le rendu dynamique de ces vidéos pop-up apporte une réelle valeur ajoutée à l'expérience de navigation. De plus, l'interface de l'outil est user friendly. Enfin, nous saluons la disponibilité et la réactivité de l'équipe."
I'm trying to use this app all get back as I set it up. hope it gives the results I'm expecting. it seems a simple and clean interface
"Revised 5 star review to 1 star. I do not know what has happened with Marsello and am honestly dismayed by our recent experience with them. We have been a customer for 3 years and have had a good relationship with them, have been beta testers, and have even been a success story for their marketing department. Yesterday I needed to do some manual account maintenance and discovered that we were locked out of the admin interface because we had exceeded 10,000 customers. In addition, the customer facing rewards interface was no longer working on our web site. We were apparently on some grandfathered plan at $59/month and they randomly decided to do away with that and wanted us to switch to their new ""pro"" plan based on number of customers. Sure, no problem UNTIL they said our pricing would go from $59 to $559 PER MONTH. An 800% price increase and the hobbling of our installed (and paid for) software is absolutely inexcusable. At this point we were essentially being held hostage until we paid. After getting the same ""I know this is a bit of a shock"" circular run-around from the support chat person, I asked them to have someone contact me ASAP. Well, I have not heard back from anyone at Marsello and we have customers emailing, calling and messaging about their rewards account. So, today we made the decision to simply dump them and switch to a different rewards application. On the plus side, Marsello made it easy for me to export our customer data along with point balances and I was able to import that into a different reward app that I had up and running in a few hours. Marsello has seemingly gotten too big for their britches. When we first signed up, it was just a loyalty program and did a good job at it. Then, over time, they made it into a customer relationship management software and email and SMS marketing software. Some of their automations are good, such as abandoned cart emails, but for the most part we continued to use it only for loyalty purposes since we have other applications that handle those aspects of our business. Bottom-line: growing eCommerce businesses, watch out for the bait and switch. Despite their response here indicating that there was a resolution, there was not one."
Easy to set up with a simple to use interface. Jon was also timely / helpful with support! He quickly helped us to get the chats in the exact spot we wanted on the product pages.
We started out with Marsello -- and we had a few issues getting it to sync with our Shopify POS. We ended up leaving and trying some other apps. But we came back. The interface was much more user friendly with Marsello and the developers were able to fix the glitch that was happening with our POS system. They have been able to ask questions for customization of our email flows and we have had no issues to date. We can literally watch our revenue increase with this application and our customers love the loyalty points from the rewards program. Give it a try!
"Pop up form is not capturing emails from subscribers which is horrible only realised it after 9 months of using it, which means we have lost tons potential customers orders.  Last but not least, loyalty rewards point have been set to a minimum purchase, and have saved the setting, but our customer still allow to redeem without minimum purchase! It is causing chaotic at our backend. Interface is nice and really wanted to like this app but that's a complete deal breaker. 
And their tech support to rectify issue take forever to reply and solve the problem!
Updates: They managed to solve the problem, would give a 5 stars if they can reply and fix it earlier"
This is the best loyalty app on Shopify and I've tried a few. Great interface and easy to use. This app is especially great if you have a retail store as well. It is the only one that integrates into your POS that doesn't cost and arm and a leg. The support is amazing as well!
"E-mails don't go out when they are scheduled, which is horrible on a day like Thanksgiving!  Interface is nice but e-mails not going out are unacceptable.  Really wanted to like this app but that's a complete deal breaker."
"SUMMARY: Well designed UI, intuitive, affordable. An excellent option for merchants looking to fast track loyalty and email without worrying about complex trigger/workflow automation and HTML email template coding. Not suited for merchants requiring custom workflow automation as you are currently limited to 5 triggers. This is sufficient for most merchants.
I am willing to update this review provided the service provider addresses my in-app questions. Support started off excellent but is beginning to wane. Not offering live chat from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM ET USA is, well, unwise IMHO. Overall, this is a good service for merchants seeking an affordable, easy-to-use loyalty and email marketing solution. The design editor is promising but lacks basic features such as image overlay, saved content blocks, abandoned cart layout customization, etc. Another issue is the inability to reorder email blocks within flows. The current setup is linear/sequential; it needs to be non-linear/non-sequential. What good is a duplicated block if you can't relocate it? This service has a lot of potential provided the developers to enhance the design editor to match or surpass competing solutions which specialize in email automation. I can easily show this company what they need to focus on the drive user adoption AND retention. Kudos for the slick UI. Much appreciated.
UPDATE #1: I almost forgot to comment on the loyalty program which has pros and cons. PROS: several layout options for your loyalty widget; intuitive interface. CONS: No way to change the shape of the loyalty widget button; can't upload custom graphic; no way to easily generate the embed code for a dedicated loyalty page; Instagram reward earned by simply clicking the button whilst logged in; product reviews only work with Shopify Reviews which suck; no way to hide button on mobile. All-in-all its an affordable entry-level loyalty option with much room for growth. I look forward to working with Marsello to enhance the service.
UPDATE #2 — Fri Apr 26, 2019: My struggle to make AND keep meaningful contact continues. The company struggles to deliver consistent support. I'm looking forward to updating this review for the betterment of the Shopify community. Words to live by: The best customers are the ones you have."
"Review was required as a set up step. So far the interface looks good and usable, once I start using the app more I will be better placed to write a review.."
I had some issues integrating it on my template and they helped me right away. I really like the seamless design and user experience over all.
"Review was required as a set up step. So far the interface looks good and usable, once I start using the app more I will be better placed to write a review.."
Great app as of right now. not too sure yet but its pretty useful in some cases here and there interface looks pretty good
"Its too soon to be sure about this app.
The interface looks great. I will write detail review when I use it more time"
"Amazing easy and fast, recommend it! Love the interface, easy collections of testimonials, proof of sales."
AMAZING! This is exactly what I was searching for!! The interface is very good looking and the app is easy to use. The price is affordable which is awesome! Thank you guys for this awesome plug-in!!!
"Great app and very functional for sure, although I guess I didn't need to update and start paying the subscription but it was worth it. The interface is much nicer and easier to use, but other than that I haven't noticed much to make it worth $19.99 USD per month. I'm still purchasing it don't worry - but that's why it's a 4 Star for value."
"Shopify doesn't have a modern system for marking products down and setting timed sales. It's an oversight that's quite strange, but thankfully for a reasonable price Bold offers this app that allows you to create discounts on a schedule with a number of features that make things like flash sales possible.
The installation was straightforward and the user interface is as well.  I haven't needed support until today for a minor issue.  This is after over a year and a half using the app. My customer service rep Naman asked if I could write a review while in the chat, so I'm doing so now as a professional courtesy. (Thanks, Naman!)
Converting sales is your job as a shop manager. For many of you, it's just one job out of an almost countless array of responsibilities.  It's daunting. Shopify's lack of markdown tools makes something like this actually pretty necessary if you have an inventory of thousands of items and variants like I do. In my experience markdowns are better for customers. They see the discount, can calculate savings, and need one less step to punctuate a sale. 
I recommend trying the app. It's a set it and forget it solution that your customers will appreciate as much as you. You can even tag sort sale items so that they populate a special ""Sale"" collection in your store automatically. 
It's pretty great and well worth the $15 a month.
Is it dumb that Shopify doesn't have this feature already? Yes. But Bold made a nice app in the meantime."
Been using this app for a month and so far it did exactly what was expected. The interface has room for improvement and there are some issues here and there but overall it is a great app. The best feature is the live support and Amish was really helpful and took care of the issues I was having in a matter of minutes. Highly recommended.
"Super supportive team, we had a major issue and the team spent hours in helping us. Clean interface and seamless GST calculations. Love it!"
Easy to use and set up .  Nice video interface.
"The App is really easy to use, intuitive and also really powerful, as they say in other reviews don't let the simplicity of the app's interface fool you, you can create beautiful, modern designs and the possibilities are endless.
And if you are starting your journey in the ecommerce world let me share with you something really important we’ve learned within the first year. When you are installing an app, you are not just installing an app, you are teaming up with a group of people, that can make your life easier or not at all.     
Now the persons that are behind Hypervisual, Jeff and Toby, are amazing, they help us in every doubt we have, always giving us a solution and always there when we need them and they have always exceeded our expectations.  
So if you want a good looking modern design for your  site that makes you standout from the competition and have a team backing you up in every step, go for Hypervisual."
"Don't let the simplicity of this app's interface fool you, it is a highly capable page builder. I am able to create beautiful, functional landing pages that have a clean code base and don't bog down the whole site. Customer service is standout too. I had a question and Jeff answered quickly and had me set up with a solution right away. Great app and really is necessary to make up for the lack drag and drop page building in Shopify."
"Customer service continues to be impeccable. I've been using Hypervisual for a few years now, and it seems like the only app I can consistently rely on. I rarely actually need help because the interface and app provides everything I need to customize my pages. But when I do reach out, I get a fast, easy solution."
The interface is really user-friendly. The team has been very prompt in helping with my queries and the personalization I needed.
"Amazing product, easy interface and adds incremental revenue with no extra effort! My customers at crabcakesmd.com are even happier than ever"
"I have used a few Shopify apps before, but this is the first app that has cheerfully motivated me to write my first app review and WOW! Toby and his team at Hypervisual have a real winner on their hands.
The customer service is exemplary by listening to my requests and responding in a prompt manner as well as Toby has been very vigilant and receptive to my custom store needs.
The Hypervisual Page Builder interface is intuitive and really easy to grasp with great little gems of brilliance placed along the way and it is these little gems of brilliance that really makes me think: ""I can do this. I can really build my store to the way I want it to look like, to match my vision.""
So, as I type this review, I am still building my store with two test products. But I must say, no matter what others tell you, no matter what others may say, you can do this. You really can have it your way. And by using Hypervisual, you can get there, today."
"It has made GST filing very simple, bringing down the time to a few hours instead of a few days! Amazing customer service, user friendly interface, highly recommended!"
"Excellent app! Quick setup. User-friendly, intuitive interface. Fast and professional support. I switched from another app, and finally, the product upload is not a nightmare! :)"
Best affiliate app I've ever used... Beautiful interface. Easy to use. Fair pricing. You can stop scrolling for affiliate apps now :)
This is tremendous! Such a simple interface with a huge amount of possibility for generating revenue! The account manager is epic is well!
"I just downloaded this app after having a bad experience with another app on the store, 5 minutes later I had questions and the customer service was just amazing, helped in a few minutes, the interface looks easy to use, I can't wait to upload more products this way to Amazon. Thank you!"
"Smooth like bread and butter. I had tried using other affiliate apps but was unable to see any success - their interfaces were not pretty in terms of the UI and UX. I run an ecommerce agency and Social snowball is a mandatory download for all of my clients. Literally free money. Customers love the fact that they get paid to promote our products, and we have even seen an increase in repeat customers since downloading across 80% of the stores we manage. Support is top notch, and the FAQ section has an answer for every question you could have about the app. GO DOWNLOAD RIGHT NOW and you'll see what I'm talking about."
"This is a very well written app with good documentation. The interface is clean and allows quick editing. Amazon is complicated to deal with but this app makes it much more manageable. Support is also excellent, they helped me get my listings set up from the start. Highly recommend."
"So firstly, kudos to the app for solving a big issue faced by stores in Asia/India region of not getting Amazon as one of the sales channel options directly from shopify. Coming to the app and support, I was new to the entire process of listing products on Amazon . We'll all agree, if it's your 1st time, Amazon processes and fields to be filled can be testing! Excellent support provided by Shubhi from CedCommerce team who's been patient enough to guide me through the entire listing process in the past couple of days. Minor bugs did come up but were resolved promptly. My products are listed on Amazon now and the interface/syncing process is super smooth. Keep up the good work folks!"
"Amazing app that I've used on multiple of my six-figure brands. There are a good handful of affiliate apps out there, but this one seems to have the best user interface and keeps everything simple and easy for me. Hated having to track every single sale individually, I love lean systems and Social Snowball allows that. Every single time they roll out a new feature, the app gets better and better.. Awesome founder and good customer support live chat too. So if you ever have a certain issue, their livechat helps unlike another company I used before this one... recommend for any sized ecom store. Free money!! Can't wait for their Klayvio integration"
"App performs really well. Easy to use, friendly interface, and most of all actually works. Very happy with this app and can't wait to see what else they roll out in the future! Highly recommend."
"Terrible App, the interface is pathetic. It only imports a small portion of your products. And I was unable to edit any ads. I also noticed that after unistalling it does not remove the charge from your billing, Shopify needs to correct this asap..."
"A very easy and friendly user interface. We have many interns and employees working on the website and it is reassuring to know that we have a backup in case they change critical settings or erase something. Since we have the app we are more keen to delegate and this freedom give ideas to our team to improve our website as they know there is a safety net (we told them what was not saved too ! :) Always keep in mind Shopify is easy to use, yes, but not magic and does included historic of versions ro backup feature ! Congrats to the dev, it is affordable and simple to use."
good application with friendly user interfaces. I think this will give me better results in the future.
"Their customer support team is very easy to get a hold of and helped answer some questions we had before installing this app. So far we find the interface very intuitive and easy to use. Another stress off our minds. Now let's hope we never have to use it, haha."
"I used this app for about 2 to 3 weeks, didn't work out well for me. With that being said, the customer service was great Egle, was very nice, fast and understanding. The cons of the app, It's mostly geared for traffic from the USA, the devs should make this more clear for people, they do give you options to choose country locations for advertising, but the majority of their traffic is from the USA. If you're looking for traffic from other countries, it will be slow.
The Pros, the User Interface is easy and simple. Getting started is quick. Good Luck all"
"J'ai installé cette application afin d'avoir un système qui permet de restaurer de manière différenciée les différents éléments de la boutique, pour faire des backups lorsque je vais faire des modifications ou installer de nouvelles app et aussi pour avoir une sauvegarde automatique. L'installation se fait très simplement et l'interface est très intuitive comparativement à d'autres app.
Dernièrement, j'ai effacé par erreur toutes les pages de mon site :-( En quelques seconde, j'ai pu les ré-installer sans problème en utilisant Rewind Backups. Cela m'a évité de perdre énormément de temps.
Je recommande vivement cette app :-)"
"Great experience, easy to use interface and proactive Customer support who help me all the way to build my funnel!"
I am trying it out right now. Great interface so far. Been easy to work with!!  The partner traffic so far seems great.
"Despite being a free user, they helped super quickly resolve an issue! The interface is also easy to use and quick. Thanks everyone!"
"I've been using this app for a few months now and weighing all factors (support, integration, ease of use, features, price) it is absolutely the BEST app I have in my store.... These people go out of your way to ensure you're getting value out of their app and that seems more and more rare nowadays. It functions FLAWLESSLY improves the user experience of my store as it offers a useful feature AND it increases conversions because it automates a task that is a pure money maker. I can't believe it's taken me this long to write a review tbh. It knocked my socks off the first month of using it."
"We were looking for an app with a good user interface and a fair pricing structure that would allow potential customers to get notified when our out of stock items were back in stock...and this app was a perfect match. Within the first month, we had over 100 notifications sent and most turned into customers...so the value was clear. Also, customer service was great (we had a minor interface issue we thought might have been caused by the app due to our complicated subscription setup and they helped to confirm where the issue was)."
So awesome! Clean interface on both front and backend. Support is quick and extremely helpful! The app did exactly what I needed :) Wish I found this sooner!
"Favorite affiliate program by FAR, and wow we've tried a lot of them. 
First things first, this app has got to be underpriced. You get so much value from this and their whole team is super helpful and genuinely wants to help you succeed. Our return on investment has far exceeded our expectations. 
The user interface is AWESOME -- it breaks down information so simply, anyone can use it. Our affiliates love using it too. Oh, and unlike other sites there's NO coding needed (yes you read that right).
Like any affiliate program this isn't magic, you can't just download it and expect sales to 10x. Running a successful affiliate or referral campaign always takes time and effort to build up, gotta put the work in  you know? But we love working with the KB team (shoutout to Vanessa), and it always feels like a collaborative effort like they've got our back too.
Definitely worth trying out!"
Easy interface and set-up. Their customer service team is also very responsive and helpful. The service is also affordable and well worth it.
"The App is great and wonderful to use. I love the User Experience that is so so friendly and wonderful
Thanks to the developer!"
Good customer service. They respond immediately. The interface is also pretty simple to use and friendly.
I love the simple set up of the app and the user interface is easy to follow. I'm still new to the app but I plan to continue using it for my returns
"Excellent platform, great support. Team are always there ready to help when needing integration, assistance or information. Constantly updating their platform and improving user interface for ease and speed of use."
"I have tried almost every multi channel program. I picked Orderhive for many reasons. 
1 Cost.. Least expensive of all of them
2.Customer Support - There is somebody there 24/7 to answer your questions.
3.It does exactly what I needed it to do.
The interface does take some getting used to. Trying to figure out how to create bundles and merge products can be a challenge. But the support staff worked me through the whole process. 
I want to especially thank a Tech Support person by the name of  Shruti for walking me through any concerns and really providing a solution that worked for us.

Again this will take some work but once you figure it our you will have a great system at a fair price."
"Orderhive is a great value, doing what other software choices promise (or at least, all our medium-sized business would ever need) at 1/3 of the cost.  The support team is phenomenal, extremely polite, and always there, day and night, helping us integrate our business with multiple different shipping carriers, and three very different sales channels.  The software updates inventory quickly across the sales channels, and makes kitting and merging products much easier than we've found in competitors interfaces.  We highly recommend this company."
the website offers good features being free. But the dashboard is little poor. So you chan work on it more for better user experience.
Impressively quick and friendly customer service. User interface needs to be improved in some point and loading of webpage need speeding up. Otherwise very satisfy.
"Prior to installing Orderhive we were manually managing our inventory across multiple channels. Orderhive has enabled us to seamlessly manage what was quite an arduous task! It has a great interface which can be intuitively be used, is very reasonably priced & the support these guys offer is incredible! Looking forward to the additional features they are adding and updating. Thank you!!"
"Beautiful interface on both ends, and very helpful customer service. I'd say the free plan is very fair, and the paid version is the best I've found."
"Cool app, speed great, interface and installation easy to understand recommend for beginners or enthusiasts."
"Great App.
User friendly interface, easy to use design settings. Don't know about customer service since I didn't required any.
I recommend."
We’ve tried other competitors and the User experience of this app is top notch. I designed my quiz in less than 30 minutes and support handled my questions in less than 10 minutes. The best quiz app so far!
"I was on a demo call with one of the team members and they walked me through the process of building my first quiz flow and it was easy to understand. Most guided selling apps on Shopify focus on logic jump points and you don't have to do that to get the results you want, which is great for merchants that aren't tech-savvy. The UI of this app is similar to the 2.0 theme builder making it easier to learn than other guided selling apps. There are a few hiccups like you can't change the primary color via entering a HEX code just yet, as the app is in the process of getting a makeover. But BEAM works fast at fixing bugs and updating products so this should be fixed soon. Plus, they have exceeded my expectations in customer service for a free app. They have an in-app chatbox that answers quickly and won't leave you hanging. Plus, the user experience of the rest of the website isn't a stark difference as the theme setting features a variety of Google fonts and allows you to change your background and add media that fit your branding. App Connectivity: 5 Stars
Learnability of App: 5 Stars
Implementation: 5 Stars
Integrations: 5 Stars
Customer Service: 5 Stars
Pricing => beta: 5 Stars This app is in beta and it's a good idea to test it with your store to make some sales and see how this can grow your business, especially if you integrate it with BEAM's AfterSell app. 10/10 would recommend. Update: BEAM has fixed the bugs and now it works beautifully with my Shopify store! After talking to support, the team quickly worked on fixing those bugs; something that other apps don't do. BEAM is responsive to their app user's needs and I respect that."
The app user interface is built pretty well but it's severely lacking conditional logic. It means whatever question you add you cannot direct it based on question which makes it pretty useless. For example you cannot ask second question based on the response to first question. ALSO the price is outrageous
Very good app to help my clients find the product that matches their needs best. The interface is fully customizable and easy to work with. This app has a positive impact on my sales.
"Great app. Great support. Love the pricing.
We added Subscription & Recurring Order around a month ago and have nothing but positive reviews so far. Setup and integration with our existing discount app was flawless, and the support team has been incredibly responsive and helpful. Importantly, this app supports auto renew, which, to my initial surprise, is not the case with all subscribe & save apps out there.
My only comment is that the admin dashboard could use some improved features to help manage subscriptions. But even there, the developers are actively working to improve the user experience and are grateful for the feedback. I hope to see several features added in the near future, and I look forward to continue working with SpurIT.
Several features that would be great to have:
- Sort and filter your active subscriptions to prepare for upcoming invoices.
- Generate automated email reminders to our staff. That would be insanely helpful!"
"It works right within the Shopify interface, very very easy. When I installed it, I was surprised how quickly it worked."
"I have four major issues with the app. 
1. First, the trial is two days. Hardly enough time to see results. I like to know a product will work if a trial is involved. I gambled on this anyway.
2. I couldn't get it to function at all. I read the setup instructions, verified it the product was added, the settings were correct, the timer was active. Still no sign of it on my product page. I tried deleting the settings that weren't working and starting over, but nothing worked. I uninstalled the app thinking I might reinstall it and see if that worked. Unfortunately, that required me to approve the charges once more (other apps didn't do that). I did NOT contact support. After that last bit, I was done.
3. It doesn't allow an actual timer. Just a pretend timer. An artificial rush for the individual. I want a timer that shows the actual time the sale is running for. I couldn't find any trace of that kind of option.
4. The scarcity option that gives the impression of how many are sold is again a pretend option. If the customer actually pays attention to the number in your shop, or the scarcity bar, they'll see it's a sham.
The good points are:
1. The settings are pretty versatile. You can make the timers do just about anything in regard to the customer. The timer can reset when the customer reloads the page, or (using cookies) keep the same time regardless closing their browser. If you're looking for a timer to give your customers a rushed impression. To push them into the emotional buy, it will do exactly that.
2. The interface is simple to use, and easy to understand. Frankly, I didn't feel like I needed any of the tutorial information going in, because it was so user friendly.
3. The guide information is well put together and easy to read. Had I any questions going in, they would have been answered by the help information.
In the end, I'd rather be honest with my customers anyway. I'll look for a timer that gives actual sales times if possible."
I really love this app. I love the interface and I had a great customer service when I needed help! I tried multiple forms app and this one is the best for me!
"This did exactly what I needed and exactly what they said in the description.
If you already have a product set up that comprises a number of other products, this app will handle inventory management for you. Every time you sell the bundle product it will update the inventory of the products it contains. It is super simple and super easy - I installed it and had two bundles up and running in less than 5 minutes. It couldn't be easier and they've made the interface really good.
Highly recommended"
"Really clean interface & templates, easy spread sheet download. Very customizable. But As a small, new & independent business, my store currently doesn't make enough revenue to pay for the $19 / month fee after the trial limits."
"This was the most frustrating experience. I tried to make simple revisions, but couldn't because of a glitch in their interface. I spent the better part of a day trying to get this right but couldn't, eventually removing it altogether."
"Can't believe it took us so long to discover this incredible app.  It is WELL WORTH the cost because it keeps our inventory on track. Amazingly simple logic that just works and and easy to use interface. I mean what more could you ask for?  Oh, I know, good customer service too? YOU BET! Harold is attentive and takes time to respond to all of our needy emails.  This is all around a five star app. Couldn't be more pleased.  We intend to be long time customers."
"User-friendly and great interface. I had been looking for an app that is easy to understand, will grant access to many features even for free and this app is exactly what I am looking for."
"I've been using this for 2 days now and it's easily the best pop up app out there. Easy interface, and so far great support. For startups that are watching budgets, this the only app you should be looking at in this space."
"Great feature - i've been waiting for a long time! Awesome way to make your website socially interactive. Customers Instagram posts  with a product shots are working for your marketing and reliability in a most appealing way.
Easy to use application, with clean interface. I would strongly recommend it to every store owner!"
Really Great app! It just works. Clean interface and super easy to use. I did a bulk edit for 1500 prodcut variants in a few min. Better than other apps. Professional looking too.
"Great app, great customer service! I was able to translate my whole store through an easy to use interface. 10/10 Would recommend."
"This is by far the best app when it comes to store analytics! You get so much valuable data presented in such an awesome interface, you don't want to stop looking at it! I had a few tiny hiccups in the beginning phase, but the support team was quick, reliable, very kind and sorted out every issue within a short amount of time! Thanks again and keep on rocking!"
"I have been understanding how my customers behave on my site. I would like to give a review on this amazing team. I can only say the support is fantastic, I've been talking with Peter from Conversific from day 1 and he really helps me to set up all the metrics. He also sent me a private demo and I really appreciate the time he has dedicated to my business. 
The user interface is very easy to understand and clean. All the integrations make Conversific one of the best apps to understand your business data. 
I can only imagine what great pursuits lay ahead of this team. Thanks."
The DataExport team were super quick & helpful when assisting us with designing a custom report to feed into our ERP system. The interface is really user friendly and intuitive but the support team does all of the heavy lifting when you're looking to add custom fields which was great. Thanks Shawn & the DataExport team!
The app looks really promising. I love the simple and easy to use reports. The user interface is well designed and easy to learn. I have connected all my data sources and can't wait to go deep into analytics.
"First, they respond very quickly to everything! So customer service is first class. The application provided useful information from the first time use. I found the comparison of products very useful and I have shaped my marketing strategy a bit. I hope that, we will have more orders for the same amount spent on ads. Easy to use, user-friendly interface. I have many opportunities, I will keep it and use it.
After a year I will update my opinion about this company."
The support is outstanding! I had a small installation issue (problem was on my end) and they could not have been more response or helpful. The app works very well and the interface is very intuitive.
"This app has been a lifesaver. As you may have already discovered, the built-in report with shopify are seriously lacking. I love the flexibility of the reports and the easy to use interface. But the real kicker, is their next-level customer support. If you need custom fields, they'll make them for you. This is seriously one of the best tools and teams that I've worked with in years..."
"It is a very easy-to-use interface, and the support team is always available to assist. For instance, we had issues with the layout of our labels on the web design, and the support team instantly resolved it. Bravo, keep it up!"
"Great app, it works perfectly to sort orders by time. The interface is intuitive and user-friendly. Moreover, customer care is truly special. I have never seen such responsiveness and prepared people. Congrats!"
User experience and customer service are great! It makes all pickup and delivery orders easy to manage.
"This app does exactly what we need it to do!  I was thrilled that the developer would do the installation for me, so I did not have to spend any time getting the app running initially.  Since that time, I have had a couple bugs with the app that were related to my theme, and Elicia has been extremely responsive and helpful in getting those minor issues fixed.  The entire interface, on both the user and admin side, is completely intuitive, and I am very happy with the emails that are sent out to customers when products are back in stock.  I highly recommend this app!!"
"Awesome support would recommend to anyone. Thank you very much for your service it really has improved the user experience on our website. 
Joe"
Translate My Store's interface is very smart and it also provides you with automatic translation of your store! Definitely recommend it.
We used the app to translate our store in 3 languages and we are very happy with it! The interface is clear and easy to use and support is great.
Great app for customizing the pricing interface for our distributors and retailers. Well done!
"The app does exactly what I need and has a simple, ergonomic interface. Best of all, the developer is quick to respond. He accommodated a request I made and added a feature within just a couple days. You can't beat that!"
The timer is definitively good but he interface is not as friendly as it should be. for example: the 24/7 bottom for contact points to a WhatsApp number that is used by someone not associated to this app. I cannot make the timer stays the whole time while navigating my website. it says that premium features are free but my timer does not flashes. I wish it will stays on the whole time only that feature is really worth it. I hope to see this app improving soon so I can give it 5 starts.
"Great Solid App. Easy to use. Very organized and clean user interface. Support was excellent. Quick, responsive, and friendly. Whenever there was any hiccup, support got back to us fast and resolved our issue even faster. Highly recommend this wholesaler app."
"Does what we want it to. The build interface could be a little more user friendly tho. I would give it 4 stars, however being a free app that works well enough it gets 5. www.adorno.co.nz"
instant upsell has been an easy way to add coupons and upsales to my site. very use friendly interface
A nice app with a straightforward interface which can be used for various purposes.  I used it to let customers know about our Christmas shutdown and other announcements.
"I use this app to provide social proof to potential customers who are browsing my store looking for original video games and anime products - which is especially useful in Japan. I like the simple backend user interface. This app is quick to install and set up, so it only takes a few minutes to have it up and running on the site. I wish there were a few more color customization options, but otherwise, I`ve never had any issues with it and it definitely does its job quite well."
"Does really well. This app exceeds how its supposed to work, and has a great interface making it very easy to navigate."
"Outstanding Service & Integration With Shopify & Respective Foundations! Always a pleasure to help others and Shop for Good really makes this possible,  while keeping the user experience on brand. They also work really well with tight time frames. All around, perfect application. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
"The app does everything it's supposed and more. Easy to use interface and design. Any problems that we had with the app were not bugs, but setup issues which were quickly resolved by customer support. Probably the best customer support I've ever experienced with third party apps. Prompt response time and resolved the issues in less than an hour!"
"This app makes my daily updates a breeze. Having used other similar apps, Stock Sync is better priced, with more features, and a very simple to use interface."
"Tiksuper have a brilliant user interface! According to different function, it divided into small parts. Each small parts have a clear function title. This is a easily use platform. I recommend you to use it!"
"I was sceptical as so many translation apps need a payment plan or hidden costs but not this one it seems, all I wanted was a few languages and it has done that seamlessly and easily. I was so impressed I felt the need to come back and write a glowing review, this is the app you are looking for, outstandingly easy but thorough interface with some personality. Great."
Excellent app to control our menus with a great user experience. Spectacular support when we had unusual questions. Recommend it 1000%
The interface is very easy to use and understand. Simple app and does its job. They also have great support
"Tiksuper has a very good interface, the support is fast, and the agents are available, fast and give good information. Keep on going!"
Way too cumbersome to deal with the interface of this app. Its like you are working in C++ environment and on top of that upon contacting the support team; they seems irrelevant of the customer questions. I am asking something else and they are responding something else. My humble suggestion is that you MUST introduce live chat service in which you can take up customers queries in live mode and provide immediate solutions. I moves to another app where I have to pay double amount but since they resolved my questions instantly so I decided to stay with them.
"Best Mega Menu App with the Easiest Interface and Fast, Responsive Customer Service. Great folks too!"
"Tiksuper has a very good interface, the support is fast, and the agents are available, fast and give good information. Keep on going!"
"Easy to set up and understand, simple interface on the cart page and/or product pages. One of the only apps that offers the true ""add-on donation"" feature a nonprofit would need for their own store. We especially like the support. When the donation section was loading too slowly and we wanted to change the email functionality a bit, Zestard was very responsive and fixed it for us immediately. We look forward to the future features they plan to offer. Thank you!"
"Works amazingly and is super easy to set up, Works amazingly and is super easy to set up, and the interface is easy to understand!"
"Most other data export apps have an interface that looks like a dog's breakfast and are slow to generate reports. Datachamp is super powerful, fast AND very easy to use with a clean and intuitive interface. You can easily generate the exact report you want with any modifications or custom columns. The price is super fair and the support is THE BEST. I was using Data Export Reports before Datachamp, but it wasn't able to get around an annoying Shopify limitation - The inability to filter on assigned location per line item BEFORE fulfillment. I tried all data export apps and none could do it. Shopify just doesn't make this info available via API. I reached out to a bunch of the app developers and none could offer a solution or get around it. But Andreas at Datachamp said ""give me a week"", and he coded up some mapping between assigned locations and line items internally at Datachamp. And he did it for free. And he keeps improving the app from my suggestions at a fast pace. This is the best data export app by far in functionality and support. Believe me, I trialled them all."
Great app - does exactly what it is supposed to. Set up is smooth and easy and the customer interface looks modern and easy ti understand.
Shop2app is a game changer in terms of time to market and excellent user experience .The features have been heavily researched and I promote user adoption from day 1.we have seen significant increase in the average time the user spends on our services and products. The best part is seamless integration with marketing campaigns and push notifications
Great integration & top notch customer service. Easy to use interface. Thanks for setting up my merchant centre!
"Shepherd and his support team have been amazing through the process of setting up and guiding us with the use of ShopppingFeeder for Google Shopping. Simple to use interface and easy to navigate, looking forward to a great user experience."
"Great app and amazing customer support, the team is very responsive and helped me solve all the questions. The quantity breaks interface integrates very well on my website. Highly recommended."
"the app works well on the platform, its easy to install with a seamless interface and customer support is responsive."
"We started using this app recently and its amazing, avoids all mistakes you do while packing as the easy scan will check the correct items in the order for us and the user interface is really good when compared to similar apps and great customer support as they have added some features immediately when we requested for them."
"We've recently started using EasyScan to aid us in improving accuracy with order fulfillment in conjunction with Shopify, and it's great! The interface is intuitive and functions integrate seamlessly into existing Shopify settings with options for barcode/SKU customization in the app. When we had questions or suggestions, the EasyScan team was incredibly responsive and helpful. They went above and beyond and held a remote meeting with us to nail down a couple issues so that the app could work to meet our specific needs. This is more than can be said for too many developers and it alone makes EasyScan stand out. This app makes it extremely straightforward to create barcodes for products, print them on labels, and use a scanner (or cellphone camera!) to fulfill orders piece by piece with accuracy and ease. The app also has options to check and manage your store’s inventory. Existing barcodes are readily available to view and edit, and the barcodes scan quickly and accurately. We are thrilled about these needs now being met with EasyScan and highly recommend it, and the team behind it. Creating barcodes for products to more fluid order fulfillment has never been easier prior to finding EasyScan."
THIS APP IS EVERYTHING! Seriously! It offers all of what I need and more.... Super easy interface. Fast responses from support. By far the best integration for me and my business! Thank you.
"I used this app to create really nice filters on my website. I believe it has increased the value and User experience of my website. 
I even asked for a modification to the app and it was affordable and quick. A fantastic support team"
"I used the free version of this app for a few months while I finalized my design and really like the interface and effectiveness of showing the reviews. Once I upgraded to the paid version, it was a game changer. The added features really made my reviews shine. One small issue during the configuration phase was quickly sorted out by their customer service and we were off to the races. I would definitely recommend Opinew."
"Great app, and even better support, with good updates that actually improve user experience. We've been using this app over a year!"
"OUTSTANDING APP! A must for all Shopify stores, cannot do without it. Amazing interface and looks beautiful on my website. 5 stars"
Just installed this app and the interface is really good. Looking forward to using this app and boosting sales.
Simple and easy to use clean interface. Amazing and responsive customer support. It gets the job done. I will definitely recommend this app.
"TargetBay is a fantastic tool for automatically generated emails and user reviews. The interface is easy to use and if you have any questions, the team is quick to respond (Bala is amazing and so helpful!). I highly recommend TargetBay for your Shopify store."
I used this app to remove watermarks and also swap better images for my products. Really easy interface.
"I had an absolutely horrible experience with Glood the app and Glood the company. 1. Poorly designed merchant user interface. 2. Limited design control of the FBT bundle widget. 3. Does not support bundle-level discounts.
4. Atrocious customer service and support. I do not recommend this app."
"amazing app! We must have tried 7-8 similar apps before coming across this app and none of them were nearly as good. They all made our site look dodgy and busy-looking except this app! The formatting looks great and blends in with the fonts and style of our theme so well, the interface to setup the widgets and customize them is very user-friendly unlike other apps and the customer service has been super helpful too!"
"Great apps, easy configuration and works, interface also looks nice. no need coding knowledge, highly recommeded!!!"
"Excellent, easy-to-use interface that lets you customize your ad's look and feel to that of your brand. Just do this once, and it creates all ads for you, so you're all done! Also, 1 click on the app in Shopify and it shows all of your stats and revenue. Very easy app to use, and it produces more revenue with no additional work at all. The best!! - https://coolguitarshop.us"
I have been trying multiple apps but I haven't come across an application as simple and easy to use as this. Really appreciate the easily accessible and extremely supportive customer support that I received. The interface for adding widgets is simply mind-blowing. One of the key features is to work on custom CSS and Analytics for all widgets.
Good app for obtain retargeting impresions absolutely free!! With a friendly interface so thank you so much guys and nice work!!
"Perfect app, i am an absolute beginner so installing and setting up was easy.  Nice clean user interface as well"
"A good app that does a lot. Only giving it 4 stars because I think the user interface could use an overhaul to look cleaner and more minimal similar to what I'm used to with other shopify apps. 
My website: www.gearscanada.com"
"Unfortunately, I'm now very frustrated with this app.  Stocky Failed to Sync and was stuck in syncing mode for over 1 week.  I reached out to support who advised me that initial syncs could sometimes stick.  I explained that this wasn't my initial sync, I've had almost 500 purchase orders.  I was then told to uninstall/delete the app and reinstall it.  Sounded like a bad idea to me.  I reached out to Support again to confirm, who directed me to the original Shopify team member, who assured me that nothing would be lost.  Stocky still didn't sync...and I received no further interaction from Shopify Support.  I then ran through the steps again, and finally had a successful sync.  But...my 2 years worth of purchase orders, my preferences, my vendor minimums, and my supplier case packs are all gone.  I'm starting over.  I reached out to support again...now 3 additional emails and have still not received any communication from POS Support.  In addition, I found that inventory quanitities (when viewing line items in the drop down menu) are no longer visible.  So...let's say you create a purchase order for Fall, but want to check your current inventory counts to see if something didn't fall into the purchase order re-order parameters, but might be right on the cusp of needing a re-order...let's say orange food coloring for Halloween or orange Sweaters for fall, I now have to leave the app to see my inventory counts and then go back to the app to add a line item???  I used to be able to just visually scroll down the list of items from the vendor in the dropdown and see immediately which ones were a little lower than I wanted them to be.  The *generate based on ""same period as last year"" functionality has not worked, and so I've been doing a visual review of my line items from the app to quickly determine if I need to add something that Stocky hasn't.  
It has been 11 days since I contacted support.  I miss Seb.
On top of all of this, I'm reading reviews and see very clearly a response to someone who deleted the app in order to fix their issues and find this : 
""Hi there - I'm very sorry to hear of the poor experience that you have had hear & would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your patience and understanding throughout this process. When Stocky is removed from an account, any transient data such as PO's etc. is removed and needs to be re-added manually - I understand that this was your experience and I hear you on that. Your feedback is very valuable to us & I will be reaching out to you via email so that I can fully capture that feedback before sharing it with our developers and to see if there is anything else that we can do that may get Stocky back to being a valuable addition to your business. Thank you & I will be in touch - Beckha""
My Orig Review:
I don't write app reviews until I've had a chance to truly test the product.  Seb's Stocky App is top notch.  We've been using it for almost a year now, with consistently excellent results.  When you re-order merchandise weekly, an inventory control and purchase ordering system is a must.  Now instead of filling our shelves with mediocre product, we are able to reorder top sellers.  We are able to identify slow moving stock for clearancing.   We are able to identify price changes from the manufacturer and immediately adjust retails to achieve an ideal profit margin.  There are so many features, and we've really only investigated about one third of what Stocky has to offer.  We have had 3 minor hiccups.  Support (Seb) immediately researched our issues and found resolutions.  1 of the issues was user error and employee re-training was implemented.  1 of the issues was related to interface issues...which Seb researched AND implemented a change for all to make that interface more obvious!  Nicely done.  The last issue was actually a Shopify hiccup.  So of the 3 issues, ALL were researched by Seb and support, and the one issue directly related to Stocky was corrected due to our feedback.  Thank you Seb.  We tried a couple of inventory control, purchase ordering apps, but by far, Stocky outshined the others.  The monthly price is a bargain compared to the many features of Stocky.  Great App."
The app interface is great! Customer Service was extremely helpful in addressing some concerns that we had. Highly recommend!
"Apps interface is really clear and easy to use, but their support is even better.
I asked about a feature I wasn't sure was included or where to find it but unfortunately said feature never existed, yet within hours the team had replied, developed it and published it ready to use on my live store. 
Wouldn't hesitate to recommend to any storeowner"
"Its always been a great support and awesome platform since the time we started using ShipHero. Trust me i have been working on every inventory management tool, and i had a great deal of issues with sync of channels to the platform, with almost every tool. I have been using ShipHero from last 3 years for now, sync is quick, it just takes seconds to sync with shopify orders or inventory. And it works great with Amazon and eBay too. There are other platforms too like Magento, Woo commerce and Big Commerce, it works great with them too. Interface is really easy, informative, robust and works with iOS devices, that's really great.Reporting tools are also very handy.
Coming to support part, support team is really helpful, they understands the problem and fixes it promptly. Never faced a issue with regards to support.
All over its a Hero product of all. Great product."
"Facebook browsers are fickle and ad fatigue is real. 
I fell head over heels in love with the Journeys concept from Shoelace and I have been impressed with the amount of communication I have received as we work together to tweak and perfect our retargeting efforts. 
As an entrepreneur, it is important to me that my company and online objectives be understood, and Florent, Fiona, and the rest of the team at Shoelace have gone above and beyond to listen to my stated desires and outcomes and have worked hard behind the scenes to help me meet my objectives. 
I can't say enough about how pleased I have been with my experience and the end benefit is an incredible user experience for our customers. 
Shoelace is a must-have app and service if you're serious about quality FB retargeting."
I just bought Cross-Sell and I love it already. The support to install was great. The user interface is very friendly and easy to use. The system has great potential to increase sales and I can see it already. Well done guys! Martin - Houndog.com.ar
"It works! But the interface to assign relationships is painfully clunky and badly needs some rethinking. Very difficult to just visualize what's been set up and what hasn't. If we were larger than we are (more product groups) - we're about 250 products excl. variants - I can't imagine how I could keep this thing up to date. We recently migrated from Nexternal which let us hand pick every relationship for every product which was absolutely awesome but an awful lot of work, so I really appreciate the ability to group similar products rather than only to be able to assign individual products. But by the same token.... maintainability will be a challenge without a better interface."
"Pencil is by far the best way to create winning video ads at scale by combining Oscar-worthy AI editing software with AI learning algorithms that effectively eliminate the guess work out of what makes for winning ad creatives. Moreover, you are no longer exclusively dependent upon an agency for video ad creatives. Pencil gives you all the tools you need to level the playing field. The interface is easy, the results are impressive. Lots of companies claim to have built a better mouse trap, the team at Pencil has actually done it."
super user friendly app interface and professional support team to answer all your questions. Highly recommended
"Definitely worth a 5 star review I'd give it more if I could. Easy to set up user friendly interface, very effective software.  
If your going down the ecom route, make sure smar7 apps are on your site."
"After comparing multiple store locator apps we've chosen Closeby. This app has a much better user experience compared to others. 
Closeby is new on the Shopify App store, but don't let that scare you; it's good!"
"We use this app to organize glass blowing classes and courses. The interface for creating the classes is intuitive. Sometimes it can get confusing having both Shopify and BookThat involved, for eg when someone cancels their registration on Shopify we have to manually delete the participant on BookThat. Great support by chat though!"
"This app is awesome.  Very easy to use...but super POWERFUL!  I am able to increase the average order value from my customers quickly...as well as giving the customers an awesome user experience at the same time with its ""gamified"" upsell features."
"Useful and easy interface! 
Liked it."
Awesome! This app super customisable and has an easy to use interface.
Holy Buckets! I have been looking for a good rental program for 3 years. Finally I found this one. The support team is super responsive and great to work with. The user experience in the setup is well thoughout and the fact that it connects to my available inventory is a hug problem solver for my business.
GREAAAATTTTT APP....easy to use great user experience
I recommend this app 100% - it is very easy to customize and covers even the smallest details and customer friendly interface.
"Easy to use interface but didn't work for me.
Wanted to use it for a bilangual page redirect.
Ended up going in a reload loop forever together with my translation app."
"Awesome support and service. 
At first, the redirection was not quick enough due to may apps loading prior to EasyLocation. Customer Service jumped in and dev team optimized to have no lag :-)
The admin interface allows to be efficient in managing continents and countries.
The best app in this field I found!"
Excellent and Prompt Support. Flexibility to design Size Charts. Most Presets available. User-friendly interface.
"I've been looking for an app which could make me a separate size chart for every single product and finally, I found it. Easy to use and personalise, also very simple user's interface. If you struggle with something, just ask for support and they will contact you very soon. Thanks Vikas again!"
"easy installation . needs to be tested, recently installed, for further information. But interface k"
"i m using this to manage bundle , let's see how it goes in 2 weeks , the interface ca be improved though."
"The app has been very useful in improving the operation of my store. The interface is fairly easy to use, and the customer service is very quick and of a high standard - when I had issues they were quick to fix things for me.
Generally I've been impressed with this app as it's made my store look more professional and improved the user experience. I looked at a few apps of this kind but happy I chose Zooomy developers.  
I'm looking forward to the addition of some features, but for now can recommend this app to anyone looking to add this kind of feature to their store."
The customer support has been great (and efficient) whenever I have hit a snag - Luna has been lovely. The user interface when setting things up is straightforward and the supporting instructional videos make it that much easier to get going. Overall very happy with the performance of the app and company.
Very intuitive interface with real location. The support team super responsive. 100% would recommend
"Great interface, quite user friendly. Was also having a problem trying to save the changes when adding free products as rewards, but customer support managed to help me resolve this quite quickly. Thank you!"
"Great application paired with stamped.io reviews. Easy to use interface for the shop owner along with our customers. Puts recently shipped orders in a Queue to send an email with a review request to the customer, only once the shop owner's permission is granted. Having Stamped.io on my website has greatly boosted the trust behind my company/products and makes selling online a breeze."
"Great Product, just setting it up now. Very user friendly interface, easy to get up and running."
"Easy to use, great interface, fast customer support! I would recommend this app to anyone having to display physical stores in a list/on a map."
"The interface makes it easy to use. I like how you can add a logo or graphic to locations if you wish. In addition, the customer service is quick and accessible."
"Amazing app. Clean intuitive interface, easy to use and great support from the very responsive developer - resolved my issues very quickly and easily. Keep up the great work!"
Great notification template interface and great team to help optimize operational emails and add to your topline!
Interface is great. 1/2 the price of others. Easy to setup and support staff was very response when needed.
"It's helpful, the interface isn't the prettiest but it does its job perfectly. Recommend, Recommend."
"This app is just what we were looking for! Now we're able to customize the emails our customers get when they make a purchase or for abandoned carts. Very intuitive interface, their support team is great, and we're sure this will help us convert a lot!"
"We're only just starting out but we are already seeing improved engagement and some revenue coming through our transactional emails. Very happy with the customization of our simple user experience but the support is what puts this service over the top. Honestly, as a full stack marketer I deal with a dozen different support teams and Spently is at the top with their quality and response. Thank you Spently team!"
Really enjoyed using the app. Interface is really easy to design customised templates that suit my store's look and feel.
Amazing app/plugin that perfectly complements our e-commerce store and Instagram account. Having a product page gallery adds a whole new element to our user experience. Snapppt acts as a sales channel that offers an appealing way for buyers and prospects to browse our range of swimwear and checkout with ease. The service and support are exceptional and I can't wait to see Snapppt's new features roll out.
Absolutely terrible. Doesn't do anything and has a terrible interface. Don't waste your time and money. Bullshit.
"This is a great app. I tried several others but this one was the winner with just the right features and a very easy-to-use interface. Oh, and the customer service is top-shelf."
Clean and neat interface. The app does exactly as advertised. 5 Stars
Very clean & easy to use interface! I recommend this app to anyone looking to easily add products to their merchant center!
"Awesome app! Did everything I wanted. This was super easy to use, the interface is very user-friendly, and it offers plenty of flexibility. I needed a nice looking slider for a feature on my homepage that would display the logos of some of our customers. This was app perfect! If you want to see an example of this slider working, check out my company's homepage and look for the slider beneath the heading 'Our Customers': https://emotrondirect.com/"
"Great, easy to use slider.  Interface is extremely user friendly and embedding is seamless.  Great product!"
"Such an underrated app. Not sure why more people don't call their customers. I learned there are many reasons why my visitors abandon, but I only learned this when I started talking to them. I also really like the chat interface, and how easy it is to access my full abandoned and purchases customers lists so I can reach out one on on."
So far so good - been using it for a while and it seems t work well. still playing around with some features but it makes for a more professional user experience.
"Easy-to-use and friendly interface for Settings. The Support team was really fast and my request was resolved within 20 minutes! This is not just Fast Checkout, this is Fast Support too! Highly recommend anyone looking for Sticky Add To Cart, Sticky Button, Quick Buy or Mini Cart to try out this app. Best thing is that it's free. Thanks so much Rita! Keep up the good work :)"
"This app is one of the best-developed apps in the Shopify app store, and it is free! It has a nice intuitive interface and a lot of customization settings. Thank you VERY MUCH!!! P.S. Waiting for more such excellent apps from you, guys."
"Absolutely useless.
Don't bother to respond to thing but spams your email. Useless service and set up one ad account and they used another and began billing card that was required for set up instead of what you would assume would be the damn ad account I selected. Wasn't even linked to the ad account that I selected it changed to another one that Shopify set up for their ads which have never used.
They must have heaps of money as they don't do a damn thing to respond to anyone but I can bet they will jump on the defensive and blame anything but themselves for responding or lack their off.
For the $15 I bothered to spend before turning off the cost was as high as. For a click. I can go and create my own ad in FB and get it for 1/4 of that instantly. 
Messy to use on mobile also. Not set up well. Bad interface. Even on PC the layout is all over the shop. Plenty of better AI services out there that respond to emails and actually worth paying for that don't charge you 10% or 5%0of ad spend or something. Will be using their competitors now that only charge a flat fee and ALSO do AI.... Fancy that guys a company that is cheaper that works also and that actually bothered to have some decent service unlike service!"
"Best search app I have found for Shopify. Results based pricing, smart results, fast, friendly custom service. Easy setup and intuitive interface."
"Great app! Great support! Highly recommended! The user interface is really easy to use, we're very pleased with the results!"
"Hands down best search app in the shopify store. We have tried a few before, and finally settled with Findify. It was easy to install, doesnt break the theme and allows for quite some front-end customisation. Take your time to go through all the features the app has to offer, it will deliver an even better user experience. App development team is very knowledgeable and responsive."
"Findify has been an awesome tool for us! During the A/B testing we increased our conversion up to a 27% in 3 weeks. The results page is very useful and it enhances the user experience in 180 degrees. 
The autocomplete tool looks very pro and our customers are in love with it. Customer service, support and implementation is superb from the Findify team."
"If you use Amazon FBA, this is the product for you. As a software developer, I had toyed with the idea of writing this very type of software, but it would have taken me weeks and costs thousands of Dollars in time. The once off startup fee, and nominal monthly fee is worth every cent. The user interface is very easy to use, and it took me all of 10 minutes to get up and running. ByteStand saves me hundreds of dollars a month in saved time and prevented errors. Well done, I'd give them 10 stars if I could."
"This app doesnt solve anything.  Its pure code interface that if you dont know code, its useless to you.  Plus after you pay the $15, they want to upsell their services to install it for you.  Zero guides.  This is not an app."
This is a lifesaver app for shops with complex shipping rules. The PHP interface allows you to create complex shipping rules. Can recommend the app enough for people who need these kind of functionality on their website.
"This app sucks, it have very cheap interface and everything needs to be payed for even the useless stuff"
Good application. Helps in the design of the online store. You can add all the currencies of the world. And you can also slightly improve the interface.
"When we started with our business idea, the setup process seemed like it’s going to be a challenge, but once we actually started the process with Supliful, it went smooth, even if we were not sure about some of the steps - Supliful was always there to help us. Customer support is always available, you just have to ask.
And the platform itself - easy to understand and with a similar interface to what we already were familiar with - Shopify, for example."
This app works great for keeping appointments organized my only complaint is I wish the customer facing interface was a little cleaner.
"This app provided the information we wanted and so much more. No more downloading and vlookups in Excel! Simple interface provides deep insight. Super simple setup. Would definitely recommend, wish we installed it 6 months ago."
"Had some issues with the offer not showing up on my store, support got on chat immediately and helped resolve. They've built the app keeping in mind to not intrude on user experience which is much better than most upsell apps that we've tried."
"By far the best app for analytics on Shopify. The user experience is beautiful and provides so many deep insights. We even had a call with Karri, one of the Founders who provided us with so much great advice. Would HIGHLY recommend."
Karri is extremely helpful when explaining the app. It’s such an easy interface and keeps track of EVERYTHING! This has made our cashflow so much easier to deal with!
First: Customer Service is fast and responsive. A huge plus for me. Secondly: The new plan provides a much simpler way to set up subscriptions in a manner that is I believe enhances the user experience by making it simpler to make a decision.
"I use UpTracker to download custom tracking info from our fulfillment service. They have no interface to Shopify, but they do have FTP. It was reasonably straightforward to configure UpTracker to process their tracking file. The result is perfect handling of our fulfillment service's order tracking info!
I recommend this app and its companion, Exportable, for your custom fulfillment processing needs."
"I had tried a couple of subscription apps, but they were a bit clunky in terms of how they interfaced with my store and the checkout process. This one integrates really seamlessly. It's also simple to set up, and when I did have questions, PayWhirl's support was quick and helpful."
Great app for lifetime value analytics with a clean interface including a dashboard with a quick view of values that matter. Highly recommended.
"Great App with new interface, it is easy to work with."
PayWhirl has a really good user interface and the support is amazing. The support team helped me to get this project over the line which I am extremely grateful for. For this project we looked at the top 3 subscription apps and these guys were the best.
"This app has been an absolute lifesaver when it comes to integrating with wish. The user interface is useable but can certainly be improved for more intuitive navigation; however, the dedicated customer service more than makes up for it. The help and support I got from Swati is the real differentiator here. She made sure my onboarding process was smooth and continues to be supportive and responsive to ensure I remain at a happy place with their solution. Recommended."
Just started using this app. the interface is very fast and detailed. Looks like it will do what we need
"So much easier and better than Printful. I had instant questions and staff were instantly available to help me out, great selection of products, great user interface."
"Awesome interface, will be testing this company out in the next few weeks!"
This app did exactly what I was looking for and solved my shipping issues in every way.  It is highly customizable and offer an easy to use interface while still giving you total control over every aspect of your shipping needs. The level of service offered and support is second to none and I highly recommend this product and stand behind the developers.
Have used Microsoft Advertising before and was quite pleased.  App works well and quite a user-friendly interface.
"We use this app to restrict shipping options for specific product variants. It's not the most modern looking or user friendly interface, but you know what, it does the job better than any other app we tested, and their support has been one of, if not the most responsive I've experienced."
"This app makes it easy and affordable to reduce image size, thus reducing load times and increasing user experience"
"We have a unique shipping setup on our store due to overseas manufacturers and dropship suppliers. Basically, if you have very specific needs when it comes to shipping rates based on origin or destination, this is the app for you to use. The app interfaces nicely with Shopify and connects to the shipping functionality natively, allowing you to work on the custom shipping setup on a custom back-end built by ASM. The developer I work with - Burt- is one of the coolest dev's I've ever had the chance to work with and he not only helped us get everything setup, but also helped me learn how to do some things on my own as well. He's always available via email or phone and will help resolve any issue in no time.
Let's be honest, Shopify is great but it isn't the most robust tool when it comes to custom, very-specific needs. Tools like ASM exist to add functionality that Shopify devs will NEVER add because there isn't enough of a demand usually. However some of us want to use Shopify for it's benefits, while still being able to do what we need to do - that's where apps like ASM come in, and they are truly invaluable for this reason."
"Not the most straight-forward user interface but in terms of reporting, this tool provides all the data I need. Chat support is super efficient, helpful and quick to respond!"
Costumer service is great! I wanted to get some help and they came online and served me within 5 minutes! Interface works super easy aswell.
"i was looking a translation app for days and tried too many but all very expensive and yet not complete as this one. Bascially all Free, plus 20.000 words offered for free as well.
Very customizable and intuitive interface. SEO editing/translate included and very easy to make .
What elsE?"
Chad offers incredible support and a really great user experience. I felt that he was genuinely invested in my success.
"Not only does this app fill a critical need, it also makes you the merchant look like a pro to your suppliers. User support has been exemplary through the Shopify interface. The developer even made an 'on the fly' improvement based on our needs/feedback. What a find!"
"The app is fantastic since it allows you to customize the layout and design. The interface is quite similar to Shopify, thus it is really easy to learn how to use it. My recommendation is to update the library and add new layouts."
"Shopify app is a must have for anyone, the interface is quite similar to Shopify so I feel like I can adapt to it faster. The layout library is limited but you can design almost anything to your liking. The price is also very affordable, I can use the Free plan and it meets my needs."
"This app is great for managing large quantities of products. I use it several times a week and it has made the task of moving and reordering products manually a piece of cake. Set up was extremely simple and support is top notch. Very small learning curve. Highly recommended if, like us, you need to easily manipulate the product positioning of your collection pages and you're finding the Shopify interface too much of a hassle. 2/22/21 - this is an update on my previous review. We're still using Collection Manager successfully. It's dependable and has made things much easier. I want to comment that their support is fantastic. I requested to a feature to have a sort of the collection by out-of-stock, and they did it. Yes, it took a while, but they incorporated it into the product. It's a great feature for us and we appreciate the Collection Manager's team ability to listen and respond. This is a good company to do business with."
Very useful and friendly interface. I just installed this all 1 week ago and completely happy. Recommend to use.
"Decent looking app, but the discount code wasn't displaying for customers. Easy interface and nice design, just a shame it trips up at the essential point."
"Just Amazing! I started my shopify store in March 2020. The first month I wasn’t getting much sales but after installing the app after a several days I saw an uptick in sales and returning customers. I have now upgraded to the silver package as my store is performing well. 
Regarding the app it has a great UI (user interface) I like how simple and efficient the app is. Plus the support team is supper helpful and personable. They even provide free online zoom chat to walk you through the set up, and hold your had so you can see how to improve your overall campaign strategy. I was hesitant at first but they have really helped me understand how to improve my store for the better."
"I'm using this app in the free plan. But it is awesome. Valuable tools plugged into one place. The easily understandable user interface, perfectly designed user interface and goal-oriented campaign design are some of the fantastic features of it.  Also unbelievable support team. You can ask any question from them at any time. Very supportive. Highly Recommended!"
"Easy to use social proof app with some extra features as well. Great customer support, Orkhan helped to review settings over a call and to setup conversion tracking. The user interface is easy to use and to configure, with plenty of features for fine tuning the campaigns."
"I use Ithinklogistics for shipping my order's for my website • https://pro-sellers.in/ I am happy with the support and working with Ithinklogistics is really awesome my RTO Ratio is very less & thanks to all the member's hiral mam / Kinjal mam / Mayank / dilip sir always there for help when we needed !

"I used the pp to translate my website into other languages, it was very helpful, I loved it, friendly interface, easy to use features, nice job over all."
very nice interface . work fast with smooth sync processing order and ithink team work fast and friendly also recommend to use ithink
"I've started using the app a few days ago and am really happy with it. The interface is very easy to understand and work with, and I love that you can also add your own manual translations. And, above all, the customer service is outstanding. Ruby and Shermelia have helped me so quickly to solve my issues and were super-friendly, too!"
App is very professional and has a nice clean feel. Highly customizable and easy interface. Customer service representative Orkhan is also extremely helpful and precise. Highly recommend!
"good service , very fast for to answer our questions ! Once you know the entire interface of the application well, it's easy to use"
I used this app to translate my shop. Excellent value and very easy to use. Interfaces really well with admin's Settings > Languages as well as Geolocation app. 10/10 :)
"At first I was confused by the app interface, but once I got the hang of it - loved it! It integrates with the Shopify native languages feature and works seamlessly. Thank you Etranslate"
"Whilst I have just downloaded this app, I can see the tremendous value that this application can bring to any online store. With dozens of customizable functions, great user-interface, and a dedicated support team -- This app is a MUST HAVE for any e-commerce store."
"This app interface is very easy to use. It makes our work reduced by half and the back-end team is swift in resolving the vendor issues. Delighted to work with the Ithink team. It is bliss for small businesses.
Thank you"
"App does what it promises. It offers different useful campaigns to create social proof used by big booking and ecomm companies. e.g. visitors currently online, number of customers who have bought. Pop-ups have beautiful UI giving a premium look to my store. Campaign setting up is very simple supported with a friendly interface. The support help from Vusal was very prompt in addressing any concerns. Highly recommend this app."
"Great app, prices are good compared to many other service providers. Only downside is the interface is not as user friendly and can be improved."
I use this application to translate my store into Russian. It has a user-friendly and intuitive interface. I enjoy working with this application. Automatic translation helps me save time.
This app made the user experience on my website SO much better. It's a must have for anyone with multiple colours. The best part? One of the best customer service experiences I've ever had. SO HELPFUL.
"Very well designed app,  the popups are easy to manage and the interface very intuitive. Thanks to the Nextsale team!!"
"This app helped me to increase conversation rate over 150%. Super clean user interface- with this product it is easy to edit campaigns as you please. This tool definitely will boost your sales, specially for drop-shippers. Thanks Nextsale team for making this unique tool for us, Worth to use."
"I am amazed at how easy it was to import my customers points from another Reward app. Smile's app is intuitive, a breeze to add branding and customize. Even with the POS app - my current customer's points came through. The POS interface is simple for my employees - just a single click to add the rewards to a customer's order. Truly - I am as excited as them!"
"Merci beaucoup, app très fonctionnelle, les options dans l'interface sont vastes et variés. Je recommande fortement cette application"
"Smile wants to force us to disable HTML emails in order to allow guest purchasers to earn points. In fact, they are discontinuing HTML emails altogether, and instead, they want brands to use the ugly and barebone default emails from the Smile.io interface. Not only that, Smile doesn't send us all the required activities to Klaviyo in the event a brand wants to trigger the emails that way. This is sad and is the reason we're considering switching to Yotpo (which comes with their own set of issues)."
"Great reviews platform with many functionalities, easy user interface and the customer service is great! Any issue they will sort out asap. Recommended!"
"Early days with using this app but the customer service, integration and interface have been superb. Used many, many plug ins in my time and somethings always difficult/a bit clunky. Yet to find any issues."
Seriously the BEST countdown timer! Its compact and not too spammy. The interface is way easier than others. And i love how easy it is to create a few different ones and integrate them with specific products.
Seems to be working well. Easy to use and interface makes sense to customise. First time doing cross selling / up selling so this is a great way to start.
"Easy to use interface, quickly built a cross sell that displays multiple products in a single window.. Great app!"
"This is application is great -  it offers a simple backend interface, and it helps streamline the product descriptions, and etc. Most importantly, their customer support team is amazing. They immediately answer requests, and will personally tend to modifications and requests on your site."
"Moved here from another app that was too rigid. 
This app is easy to use, has a great interface, and actual functionality that helps (vs being reactive and creating more work). 
The support team was fantastic. They basically ""held our hand"" throughout the process as if they were on our payroll!"
"Awesome app and easy to use. Both the on-site look and back-end interface are beautifully designed. We had an issue getting the app running on our site at first, but Daniel at Pretty Product Pages responded immediately and got the app running quickly. Excellent customer service! Totally worth the money."
We use this app on a daily basis. It's incredibly straightforward and has a great interface. The team was very supportive to set everything up and they are always open for feedback and questions. Totally recommend!
"gooten is greats; I love their metal
Prints. Easy intuitive interface, well-priced. Highly recommend!"
Installation and interface is easy to use. Great product selection and customer support. Very happy so far.
"The app is simple to use. I love the interface. When I had questions about shipping and product cost, I was easily able to find that with a quick search."
"I think the interface could use some updating. I wish there was a place for me to look at my library of uploaded art work. As of right now you have to make a template to see any of the art work you have uploaded. Also the template making process is extremely slow. Ultimatly I liked their product selection as they had some woman's shirts that the other companies did not have, however when I needed to do an all black shirt collection they were out of stock in med, large, and extra large in black with no idea on when they would be back in stock. The shirt was the only woman's shirt that ran true to size and not small. The app was easy to navigate as it is really a simple app which is not all bad."
Very good experience! The interface is smooth easy to navigate through. Much better than many other vendors I've used.
"One of the best POD apps! Nice interface, excellent quality products, and super fast shipping! My customers were really satisfied with the order. Definitely recommended"
"So far so good! I've been switching my business from Printful to Gooten and so far it's been a blast. Their interface is clean and intuive, their products are good, and their customer service is on par so far. Keep it up!"
"Great and simple to use! Free plan also available for simple notifications and great interface, user friendly which is important! Good support"
"Great and simple to use! Free plan also available for simple notifications and great interface, user friendly which is important!"
"Well I had given this ap a 5 star review way back when but they have since revamped it and RUINED the ap all together! Now this is coming from some one who loved it and ranted and raved about it so you know it's a 100% honest and accurate review. The NEW version does not work and is horrible. I just scheduled a mailer to go out for 9:00pm Thursday with a deep deep black friday discount code of 30% to our almost 60,000 customers and they sent it out 11 hours early costing me money in revenue, meaning that I had not intended to give a 30% for 11 hours early. Plus it only sent half the emails so it FAILED all the way around. Anyone who runs or owns an Ecommerce store know TIMING IS everything on the internet and when things are posted or sent out from facebook posts to instagram there is a proven marketing formula and when you schedule something to mail out on a holiday or for a follow up sale  timing is paramount to the success of the mailer or the campaign, For that this fails miserably. They have also ruined the interface and made it way to convoluted to work with not to mention lost some of the key functions that made it a great ap and tool for our store. This is no where near the same ap and I can no longer risk it not working and costing me money and not sending out to my customers I have zero confidence and am canceling it. Will let all know when I find a replacement ap, Which there are many out there. In closing DO NOT GET OR USE THIS AP for your business it no longer functions the way it is supposed to all the way around and will cost you money."
"I use this app as a lead magnet to grow my email list and it does this job just perfectly!
Also, I am happy with the customer service and overall user experience.
Totally recommend!"
This pop up is eye catching and creates a fun user experience. We love all of the customization options.
"The user interface in their software is A+. It's hard to believe how sophisticated it is compared to other popular POD companies. I've had a couple of different exchanges with their support and sales team and have been nothing but impressed with speed, clarity, and kindness."
"I sell original digital art on my new shop reralimpressions.store and as a new business i did and am still doing research to find or change my print on demand service. I came across gooten and gave it a shot along with gelato and prodigi. for pricing its a tie with gelato being the most competive canvas pricing. uploading images in bulk is very easy and efficient. The one primary reason I am not using them as my primary pod company is that gooten is behind the others when it comes to product creation for canvas prints, If my image is not exactly the canvas size i can only crop it not resize it to fit. Prodigis app does this best as it automatically recomends print sizes and also alows you to resize but they are the costliest of thr three in comparison. Gelato allows resizing but its a bit less user friendly. If Gooten offered a product import service like Prodigis concierge service for customers offering a large amount of products with them or if they had a better interface i would choose them over any other but for now it seems they arent the best fot for my needs."
"Awesome product can't wait to see what it does to my store and hopefully boost sales.
Easy to use interface sales increase."
"I am a user from Japan, and I feel that its setting will be very cumbersome. Then I started my trial. I did encounter problems, but I reported my problems to the development team. They actually did it within 2 days. Set it up for me according to my ideas! Not only the settings, but also helped me modify the location of the interface, fonts, etc. The service of this team is really great!"
"I'm using Gooten for the phone cases - nice interface and easy to set up. Also, Gooten's customer support is great. I had a problem with the app install into my Shopify store. I think I hit the wrong account when I was setting it up. Gooten Customer help was super helpful and the issue was resolved in a few hours."
"The worst print on demand company I have ever used. Orders were delayed, customer service took days to respond, then would respond with a canned up, scripted response that did not address the issue, the user interface was extremely slow, at one point it stopped syncing with my shopify store and I didn't know the orders weren't getting printed. The cutting boards image was dull (the same file that came out bright with my other POD). The last straw is when my customer bought a puzzle as a gift and the tracking said it arrived and it never did (I have confirmation from the PO that they never received the package) and then I emailed the Gooten help desk and NO RESPONSE. **If you care at all about your business reputation then do not use Gooten, too risky."
"Has really improved the user experience for searching and finding products on our store, so far really impressed."
I use this app for all my store's needs. I rely on their speed to get my orders delivered to my customers! Such an easy user experience on their end. Overall best print on demand process.
Great app; tremendous value for money and easy interface. 6 on 5 stars for coming back and improving their customer service!
I really like this app compared to other print on demand companies. The interface is really easy to use and support has been fantastic to deal with. They also have a nice selection of products. So far I am very happy with them.
Amazing app easy to use great interface truly impressed. I am new to all this so im not app savvy and this was excellent.
"Cheap prices and relatively quick fulfillment. Their user interface isn't the most intuitive, though, and the lack of automatic shipping price integration keeps them from being the perfect solution."
Good App to navigate physical stores. User friendly interface & easy to use. Accurate results without hidden charges. Highly recommended. BEECHTREE.PK
"So far loving this app! Lots of automation potential to save loads of time. The app was quick to install and very user-friendly interface as well. I haven't had a need for support yet, but they did reach out after I installed the app to see if I needed help, which was a nice touch. I think this will be worth the investment for us!"
Excellent Product. Excellent User Experience. Vitalii has been very helpful in helping us with any questions we had about the app. Highly recommended.
The support team did a great shop of answering any questions I have had and the interface is simple and easy to use.
"It takes a lot of organization and time to effectively create a workflow for your custom options. Once its all together it really works well, BUT there are always hiccups in software and user interfaces that weren't designed to work together natively...
But the Advanced Product Options team's customer service is out of this world. They respond quickly and work on the backend to get any issue that I have fixed. I've had 3 or 4 issues in the last year and each one was taken care of by their team within 3-12 hours and all I had to do was write an email,  give them access to the backend, and they've taken care of everything. I'll be a customer for the foreseeable future."
"For $14.99/mo their support team needs to respond faster. I installed the app yesterday and submitted a request for installation. The team responded the next day (which isn't unreasonable, but other teams have responded within HOURS of receiving an email). While I was waiting I began creating a template that was relatively easy to do. It's not the best interface but it is doable. I received a collaboration request this morning & accepted it within 5mins because I was notified by email as soon as it came in. I have not heard anything else from their team after two emails to confirm that they have access. I also looked on Shopify to see if anyone logged in from their account, which they haven't. This is problematic because:  1. This is wasting time on my free trial. 2. As mentioned, other teams respond significantly faster."
"We are typically against adding apps to our store, but custom development was REALLY expensive, so we tried every customization app out there and aside from live preview (which really doesn't work that well on the other apps anyway), Advanced Product Options provides the best and most comprehensive functionality. We are able to get very deep in the conditional logic for our products, and it has allowed us to add a better user experience. The best part of our experience so far is the amazing customer service provided. They handle every question quickly and have done tons of little tweaks to make the app work with the user experience we are trying to provide on our store. 100% recommend!"
"The devs are so promptly helpful and patient, and I can feel how eager they are to improve their app base on the user experience."
"Easy to use, and good interface. I had an issue with it and the support team reached out to help me solve it right away. Great customer service, which is important to me!"
This app is great and the customer service is even better! The interface is very easy to use and installation is a breeze. I can't believe it's free!
"Great app, easy to use. I downloaded it today to get some FAQ on my product pages and needed some assistance. It took only a few minutes for them to start chatting with me. Prompt customer service and great user experience!"
"App setup page is not straightforward and I cannot save the setup at all.
Support not responsive when I submitted help request on Thursday US PDT PM. Now its support chat interface says it's out until Sunday."
"This is by far the best Faq help Centre app available. Have tried 2 other direct competitors.
PROS
easy install
user friendly interface
can add to any page
can add mulitiple Faq sections
AWESOME FEATURE = AUTO COLLAPSE PREVIOUSLY CLICKED QUESTIONS!/
change heaps of colours (can be a skittle factory if you want)
fast loading in both the app dashboard and on the website
works good on mobile
cheaper that competitor
better functions and doesnt crash like competitors
Things i would ask the developer to improve (why i didnt leave 5 star)
1 I do not see a font changer ( this can be over come by choosing the font you want in WORD and then copy and paste
2 need to add something to change its overall width
3 maybe make adding it to a product page easier
could a was this answer helpful thing be added?
Happy paying customer!"
"Advanced Product Options (APO) really takes Shopify to the next level. Many products are best appreciated when purchased with others within the store. Data indicates that people are more inclined to select these add ons when easily accessible on a single page. APO handles these scenarios well with great options for customer visualization.
Support is fantastic! It is like having another member of the team working with me to create the best possible user experience. Still within the trial period and this app has already paid for itself. This is not just a ""sometime"" app. This is mission critical for a successful business. 
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, so much!"
"I have been trying to build my eCommerce site and wanted something that would be easy to use and offered me good information and an easy way to fix and update items. I am so happy I went with SEO Booster. The interface is easy to navigate and understand, the information is clear and concise and I have been able to make improvements on my pages on my own and with the help of the customer service support team, I worked with Flora, who was so great! I wish I had done this months ago and I am looking forward to learning more and working with a customer service support team that has caring and extremely knowledgeable people."
"Really Really greatest app ever on Shopify store, useful, easy to use, great interface. Customer support is the most part I loved, We really recommend using this app, you can check it out on the website too. https://qasitli.com/"
Just installed the app today. Had a couple of questions & got responses from the developer promptly. It was very easy to set up with a great interface & seems to have all the features I was looking for.
Really great app! It is easy to use and have a good interface that are straight to the point. The good thing is that it is free.
"I can't be more grateful enough for this app exists and is it essential for a The interface on this app is simple yet powerful, and thank you for the one who developed this app and I hope it can stay free for a small business like us. and Shopify should be included as default features. It is essential for business which sells physical products"
"Another fantastic product from cedcommerce guys. I am already using couple of their apps so I expect only the best from them. And they deliver the best with every product. Easy to use, friendly user interface and most importantly it does exactly what it says it does. Customer service is outstanding. Thanks Singh and Aman for all your help."
"Very useful app. Great interface, very easy to use and above all it is free. Adds credibilty to my products. I really like it and recommend it to everyone."
"I really love the app. Great quality garments and easy to use interface..... only thing is I’d like to see more options when it comes to men’s clothing; joggers, all-over print shorts, etc..."
I have just started using Printify in the past few weeks. There templates are super accurate and the entire interface is so easy to use. I have tried about 3-4 other print on demand companies and Printify is so far the easiest to use. They also answer questions pretty quickly!
"Edit: Upon writing this review, I was contacted by their team who helped to remedy the situation. Their response time is quick and they do try to make their customers happy. I can see that they are currently working on remedying the bugs. Original Review: User Interface is fairly straightfoward, however they do have a lot of bugs -- such as their Order Routing feature, Delay in receiving information about the Order from the Print Providers (7+ days), and that the status of their Production (In Progress, or even Printed) is inaccurate and they might not even have the item in stock. I have placed and paid for orders and still been told 7 days later that the item is out of stock. This results in a very delayed alert to the customer, and that is not ideal for small businesses. They don't have a feature to automatically update the stock of items on to your website, and they can't sync with the Printers' inventory. However, if you do choose to use the order routing feature it can be advantageous to do more generic brands. I would not recommend this for brands looking for higher quality products for their customers, since those products are not reliable and often sold out."
"Printify's interface and usage are a bit more complicated than it's major competitor, Printful, but it offers more options for products, and some have better quality than Printful. At the moment, I'm using both PODs, and also another one called Gooten. I think is important for Shopify owners to see which PODs offer the best prices, and quality, as it varies from each supplier. And in my case, I don't see a reason to stick with just one POD provider."
"UPDATE: After posting this review, a customer service supervisor reached out, and has repeatedly asked for us to update/change our review. So here goes: -Printify did refund our problem orders placed with them in November after a lengthy email exchange (thanks, because we did refund all of the purchases our customers made).
-We have since removed all of our PRINTIFY supplied items on our site, and are actively looking for new suppliers.
-We will not be amending our review from 1 star -- because we received numerous 1 star reviews from our customers about their purchases -- which of course affects our reputation with future customers. ----
Since PRINTIFY does read these reviews, our suggestion would be: find more reliable suppliers, and work on the quality of your products, but also your customer service and customer interface on your site, so problem solving isn't so difficult. If i could give them a negative star review, I would. Over the past year or so, we've had problems with 1 of every 2 orders placed with them. We even upgraded to Printify Premium a few months back to see if that helped... and the customer service actually got worse. ++Shipped partial orders, and claimed they were complete (check)
++Misleading product descriptions (check)
++Poor quality products/printing- totes & pouches (check)
++Shipment labels generated (to stay within stated printing timelines), but products were not handed over to shipping carries for DAYS (check)
++Average time to get a reply from Customer service (2-3 days). I've emailed them so many times, I feel i know each of the staff... Otto is the most responsive, he replies 24 hours later typically. Excuses and lies - an ""passing the buck"" to their providers seems standard. Final straw, after days of waiting for a problem ticket reply, was is getting an email saying that the TRACKING system from USPS is not accurate, but the 'items' are their way and they're ""sorry for any inconvenience."" Sorry doesn't cut it, and neither does blaming COVID for delays, its been 9 months, and we're all dealing with covid with our own businesses, which is why its important to be transparent with your customers and provide accurate and honest timelines and details, so everyone knows exactly what to expect. Do yourself a favor, (and avoid 1 star reviews from your customers for you, as well)... find a different company for POD."
"Probably one of the best affiliate marketing apps I've used so far. Their support is very responsive and helps a lot. The app is pretty straight forward and easy to set up while also being integratable to your website. The interface is also pretty neat since it allows the affiliate to view their our insight and performance! Overall, I'd recommend this for anyone who is looking into affiliate marketing."
"Re:Support, forget it. Well the shipping zones didn't work right, not saying I didn't do something wrong. I contacted their support and the ""live"" chat says, usually responds within a few hours, ok, let me try anyway. So I reach support by waiting 3.5 hours, explain the problem in detail and they give me a standard setup FAQ. I tell them those steps don't work, wait 15 minutes for them to see this message and 10 more for them respond. They send me another article, I walk through it and tell them it's all done, it takes them 15 minutes to see that message and 10 to respond with a walk through video that is 3 years out of date on the interfaces. I tell them I did the steps in that video anyway by poking around. I am now at almost 5 hours, waiting for them to read my message. I totally expect they will tell me to read something else without reading all the words I wrote. If you think you might EVER need vendor support, do not install this app. I'm still waiting."
Great customer support by the team! they resolved my problem quickly right after I contacted them. the interface is brilliant and very easy to use. Almost every next day i need support and they are always available to help so quickly. Amazing app amazing support
"The service is great, and the products are great. The issues I have is that the product design interface is kind of flimsy. I can't click any up and down arrows to precisely move a design on a print area template. They used to have that feature recently, and now it's gone. Secondly, their pricing interface when creating products has changed. Instead of showing everything at once, the price, profit, and profit margin are condensed into a dropdown menu, which is too much back and forth, especially if you have a product with several variants. Third, the design interface has features that disappear, like the click and drag resizing tool and the rotation tool, whenever a design is made larger. Another thing that I would add is that the website in general is very hard to look at because they put very light pale grey text on top of a white background, and very, very white products showing on a white background and I am straining to see stuff on the website. It needs to have more contrast to be able to see things easier. As for order placement I was upset when they could not be able to cancel an order for me when I accidentally selected the wrong size, and I tried to cancel it within one minute of placing it. They told me there was nothing they could do. I said that I would go ahead and accept it and maybe I can have a little something extra anyway. When I received it, it was printed the wrong way, and they gave me a refund. The good things about Printify are it's product choices. Printify has a wide range of products that exceed the product choices of their competitors. If you're looking for a high quality print service to integrate with a Shopify website, Printify is great. As for some of the errors I mentioned earlier, I do hope that they get fixed, as it's making product creation a little difficult."
"Been using for about 3 months now.
Pros: Good print on demand supplier. Prices are worth the premium charge if you have constant sales. Good product selection.
Cons: Interface with Etsy is terrible especially with the inability to bundle products, keeping up with quantity of products is hard, and provider ratings aren't as accurate especially with shipping calculations"
Great and easy to use. Clear interface and useful data insights. This app helps us understand site behaviors and great for analysis.
"LuckyOrange is amazing at helping you to understand what your users / customers are doing on your webstore by showing their interactions, clicks, scrolls and navigation. Install is super simple and the interface is easy to use. I would highly recommend LuckyOrange to anyone wanting to improve their UX and UI."
Just installed let me check out the outcome. However the user friendly interface is great. Good to go
"Incredible customer service, and great interface. Integrates with my mailchimp, and and looks great on the website!"
"Great app, made my life a hundred times easier! The user interface is clean, and the set-up is easy as well."
Has a very user-friendly interface. Works perfectly. The support is very responsive. I highly recommend this app.
Excellent app in terms of simplicity. The one MAJOR thing that stands out with this messenger remarket app compared to the others is that there are opt out buttons in each automated message. This is critical for your user experience and your FB account not getting flagged for spamming people. Recart doesn't have this. I would like to see the ability to change the automated message times. 30 minutes is too fast for the first message. Also needs some more product campaign features outside of the initial add to cart remarket. It builds a list so we should be able to use that list as needed since we as store owners are paying to get those add to carts initially. Those aspects are not valid enough to deduct any ratings in my opinion - still a really solid app and easy to use. Just points to make. We made our money back in the first day.
Great app. Loads of features and easy user interface. Really good support any time of the day. I would highly recommend it.
"Buzzbassador helped us automate what was a very manual ambassador program which allowed us to grow our ambassador list 3x since adding Buzzbassador. The integration into our Shopify Plus account was easy and all the coupon codes are automated and changes are made and effective instantaneously. The interface is beautiful and very user-friendly. Each time I needed additional help navigating the app, the support staff was quick to respond with a solution or recommendation (huge shout out to AK, our amazing support rep at Buzzbassador!). Lastly, it is clear how much this company values the feedback of their users. I needed a couple of changes to our application form which at the time were features they did not have but within a couple of weeks, Shelby responded back to me directly that they made that change and updated our form. In addition, the founder and CEO took the time to connect with me directly to discuss my company's experience with using the app. I am PROUD to be using Buzzbassador and look forward to all to come in 2022!"
"I can't say enough great things about this app... and the team behind it. Between the overall look and functionality of the interface plus the features it offers, you will NOT beat this app. I'm a very harsh critic when it comes to apps, so trust me when I say I researched a ton of them before finally deciding on Buzzbassador. Additionally, their support is amazing! Hats off to AK and Shelby for listening, responding, and, most important of all, acting on my requests."
Best User Experience Analysis Platform FigPii is the best tool to track the customer experience in your store. What I like the most about FIgPii is watching a session video from real customers. It gives me real insights into user experience and how has to be the user interface. Best user experience analysis platform for the tools it offers.
"igbaa.com
So far so good. I like the interface , great customer service. I cannot wait to open up shop and promote this feature."
It's super easy to use. Great interface. I wish they had a lower cost monthly fee tier for these stickers as I'd like to use more than the free ones but my store isn't generating enough orders to warrant doubling the cost of my store.
Awesome App! Love the interface and defiently loving the dark theme. Interesting to integrate through the app and find to get to each thing with ease! Looking forward to using
"Good customer service, not super intuitive, the user experience has a long way to go but there are loads of options and they're quite helpful."
"I like that there are many products, but the user interface is too cluttered. The catalogue is not intuitively easy to find and the region functionality was confusing at first. Other than that, great platform!"
"Je sui satisfait du service, produits de qualité, interface facile à utiliser. Vivement que vous fassions des ventes ensembles."
"A+ app experience. Best app i've used for digital products. It has a great interface, lot's of customizability, and the customer service has been quick and super helpful. Highly Recommend going with Sky Pilot"
"After having installed several other apps that do print on demand, Printful is by far the most user friendly interface. While other UX's in this category are very clunky and not intuitive, there is a logical progression through every step in the design process here. I use this app for a few of my Shopify Plus stores and my only complaint is that I will get customers that send me photos of crooked design placements (and yes, our print files were placed squarely within the guideline) or print that comes off after a few washes. All in all, this app is a great way to test demand with no upfront cost. Great work overall. As with any project like this, there is always some improvement still to be done."
"An easy app to use and install, it works very well and fast to make new custom contact forms, the interface is good, intuitive and looks beautiful on the site."
Great App! Easy and friendly interface. Fast customer support. Gives a Great and professional Touch to our website
"The interface is simple yet very effective. It fits on any device! Looks nice and sends the messages directly to our mail system, so we can be very responsive to out customers!"
Easy to use app. The interface is simple yet very effective. It fits on any device! Definitely a recommended app! Happy to use it!
"There are several advantages for daily working by using this APP for a period
1.Quick searching speed via a variety of key words.
2.Powerful function of exporting order data, which is very convenient for data analysis.
Some tips to improve
More simple interface design
Add the function : enable linking to shopping website product link by clicking item SKU"
"I am using this app to help me give a better search engine experience for my customers. Great customer service. Kudos to the team. I must also say that their app is very fast (milliseconds) and provides a lot of flexibility for our store on what products or collections to display in the robust search and filtering engines.  You can customize the content and labels all throughout. 
I couldn't imagine uninstalling this app. It would be a Major downgrade to my potential customers' user experience.
Kudos to the team!"
"We trialled multiple booking apps for our rental platform and IzyRent was by far the smoothest and most flexible, with an incredibly easy to use interface. Their support is excellent too, helping out with a request and providing a solution in just a matter of hours. Cant recommend this app highly enough."
great user interface its easy to follow and to add products . no more difficulty in importing products .its very easy
"Worked first time without any issues, nice selection of graphics and simple user interface. Also, the app developer reached out a couple of days after install just to check everything was okay...thanks for the good app"
"This app is easy to use, and the interface is user friendly. Most important of all, the costumer service is fast and efficient, they will try their best to meet my requirement and solve the problem. Higly recommend!"
This app is absolutely AMAZING. There is nothing like it out there and it the developer even took time to customize the interface to make it perfect for our store!
"Though we have only recently installed the app, it can be said that Qstomizer provides a thoroughly crafted user experience, hitting all the basics and adding customizability for specialized needs.  The customer service provided is incredible, specifically Ramon who assisted our team in integrating the app and navigating errors that occurred due to our theme's preexisting settings.  Thus far Qstomizer has proved to be a quality app with dedication to rely on."
They are such a helpful team and the app interface is so easy to use. They give out a lot of freebies and they help you grow!
"I highly recommend this app to anyone looking for an upsell app. I have tested out all other upsell apps and this app is by far my favourite. It has a great interface that is very easy to use and has a wide range of upsells to create, and if I ever have any issues/questions the support team are super helpful."
"This app is amazing! We were already selling products before we even finished installing it. The backend is robust and and flexible so it works great if you make the products yourself or if you have a third party make them for you. The interface is very user friendly so your customers will think you spent tons of time coding this :). Their customers service is also lightning fast and helped us get online in a flash. If you sell anything that can be customized, add this to your store!"
"this app is really cool. I really loved the interface. and talking about specialties you can enable different automation for the smooth task. and moreover, the support team mig she is so friendly she literally help me from the beginning to complete my whole setup. took around 3 hours and she replied to me with each details man that is so good."
"Very Good App, the cross-sells are really easy to set up and user-friendly interface. Great for new owners because its free, and avoids and unnecessary expense in the beginning. The staff is very friendly and helpful also so I would recommend them highly"
"The user experience is very good, most of the problems can be solved in time, and discard the order email recall effect is good However, we really hope to add data information to the marketing email. The experience of email marketing is not good. We can only see the number of sent goods, but we can not check the click situation of inserted goods in the email content and the subsequent conversion situation, which is very important for us!"
"Works well and is much cheaper than most competitors. Customer service is good and fast, also better than some expensive competitors. The user interface can be slightly confusing but the support team is very good."
"We were looking for a means by which we could provide monetary support to those organizations that were combating Covid-19. We needed a solution that was easy to set up, easy to understand with regards to pricing; and most importantly, an app that provided an intuitive interface in which our customers could engage. 
Change commerce was extremely helpful in providing instructions on pricing and implementation (Thanks Ronny!). The team was very communicative (Thanks Savanah!), and walked us through the details.
The fee structure is fair and there are plenty of great organizations to which you can choose to donate!
I definitely recommend this app to those store owners looking for a solution at providing a means by which their customers can donate to a wide variety of charities/altruistic organizations."
"We could not be happier with the user interface, the level of support we got when setting up, or the support since.  This team is truly outstanding in every way.  Highly highly recommend."
Easy to install and a great user experience.  Automatically calculates at checkout and no surprise duty fees for our customers.
"This is what I call a wonder app! It does perfectly what is says: viewing as much images as you want in the way you want in a very user friendly interface.
And besides that it has a great and very quick help service (not unimportant to say the least...)"
"Definitely recommend this app. Amazing to use and easy interface.
The Chat support of this app is mind blowing they will unlock some paid features also if you request them. If it helps me increase conversions I will upgrade it ASAP"
Testing the app at the moment. 5 Stars to the prompt Customer support. Nice interface for loyalty points function. Learning the functions at the moment.
Super easy setup! Love the customization and the simplicity of the interface. The opt-in options are the best I've seen!
"A bit of a slow interface, however a good selection of features. Email campaigns are a bit difficult to put together."
"I just installed AiTrillion and completed my store setup. I can't comment on how this will work and for this I gave it 4 stars. My current rating is very good when it comes to the features this app promises, all rolled into one! The interface is also simple and intuitive, made even easier to use thanks to the step by step procedures. I hope to have great results soon and to come back here with a 5 star review!"
Ich nutze diese App. Aus User Experience und User Interface Sicht sehr einfach gehalten. Sehr schneller Support im Live-Chat. Kann nur weiterempfehlen.
Best cookie consent app I've tried. Customer Support is very quick and helpful. Interface and Settings are very intuitive.
"The app has some good features, if they could actually work. The interface looks simple and user friendly. The problem is few of the integrations work or are too timeconsuming and complex, and maybe more suited for businesses with existing accounts with the shipping services they want to use. 1. Parcel2Go integration doesn't work at all. When you try to integrate by using the login Zenstores provde, nothing happens and you get left with a blank background screen and nothing else. 2. RoyalMail only works with an OBA account. However, to register for OBA you need an existing account number, according to Royal Mail support I contacted. It's another time consuming process that takes a few days to get approval for. RoyalMail's quick and easy click & drop services can't be integrated with Zenstores. 3. Yodel too can't be integrated unless Zenstores does it manually. Zenstores ask for a Yodel ""account number"" while the Yodel account does not contain any account numbers. Turns out Zenstores description is misleading and ""account number"" is actually the first and last name in the Yodel account, so why not call it what it is? Then you need provide Zenstores with a ""Netdespatch Username"". They provide no clarity or screencap where to find this information, and the Yodel account does not contain anything with this description. When I contacted Yodel, they had no clue what a Netdespatch Username was. So, I wasted a lot of time back and forth on these things and in the end could not get anything working. Zenstores support is terrible and they didn't understand the problems even with screencaps provided."
"I did try an earlier app prior to Retter, but that was laggy and had a lot of ads popping up in the free-plan every now and then, which is surely not the case with Retter. The extensive level of information and all the nitty gritty related to customer's visit on the website that Retter provides is beyond amazing. The interface of the app is nice, clean and extremely well-organized. Above all, the level of support they give is beyond amazing. Shout out to my guy Vlad for solving all my issues regardless of whatever time of the day I contacted them. 10/10 from my side, and 100% recommended."
"So far this is a solid 3.   I'll start with the good.
I'm primarily selling the MacBook covers.  It's a unique product that can appeal to a broad audience depending on your designs.   Per FB, roughly 58M people are using MacBooks.  You should be able to carve out a niche and design to that sub-market.  
The template was good and I felt the interface to apply my design was more than adequate.  Very easy to use, especially if you correctly sized your design image.   The default mockups during product creation are good and they offer additional PSD templates for more mockups.    
One downside, the newest MacBooks are not supported (i.e. My girlfriend's new Macbook).
The unique product, the design / creation interface, and supporting mockups are all very good.  They lose one star on this section because my girlfriend is annoyed at me.  She wanted her dog on her MacBook.  That leaves them with 4-stars for this section.
So far I have experienced similar shipping delays and tracking number problems.   You will not receive a fake tracking number as information will show up a few days after getting your initial tracking notification.  That will certainly confuse my customers.  Until then it looks like as it has no data (i.e. fake).  
Once the data arrives its not very helpful.  My sample order from Nov 13th still shows last activity of initial hand-off to shipper as of Nov 21st.   No movement and it hasn't arrived as of Dec 2nd.   With the holiday, I'm still within the 2-week window so they get the benefit of the doubt.   I'll be home from business travel in 4-days and I hope its there.  
Customer service has been very friendly and marginally helpful so far.  It seems they do not have direct access to production or shipping data.  I envision them having separate text windows with the manufacturers trying to get updates.   My inquiry of the original sample order took a couple days to get confirmation that it shipped even though no update via tracking number.  Apparently, my order is in a shipping container somewhere at sea per support.   Again, home on Friday.  Fingers crossed.     
A lesson from my old days doing crisis management, no information is worse than bad news.  Most people can work with bad news.  You can make adjustments, new plans, etc.  No news, is typically very bad news.  
If they have issues and they know it, make a statement and tell us your plan for resolving it.  Do follow-ups with progress reports.  
Shipping so far is a 2 at best, but it may increase if the item arrives this week.  
Since I haven't actually received the product, I cannot review its quality."
"Absolute Garbage! THE worst POD app I've used. Horrible user interface. No tracking information and customer service runaround. The advertise cool products, but they are too much of a liability to trust at this point...stay away!"
"Great app, with good customer service and a nice clean interface. Integrates well with all of the couriers including Royal Mail. Would definetely recommend."
"Works as intended, and the support is the best i have experienced, it has a very detailed interface and very good multi language support."
"We've been using Zenstores Despatch since we launched almost a year ago and we are absolutely happy with the service. The interface is simple and very easy to use and finding your way round is not a hassle. Not to mention cutting down shipping time. The team there are very responsive and helpful, which is an added bonus for us. We will definitely continue to use Zenstores as long as we are in the e-commerce business."
"I used this app so that customers could upload files to be printed for them. I like the easy to use interface and ability to change the upload button's appearance. The support was great. I wish the app could preview PDF files, not only image ones. Or have the link to file on the cart page open in a new window on its own. Overall I am happy with the app!"
"Beautiful app, fantastic support, flexible interfaces, a joy to use :)"
"The overall user experience of the app is perfect, everything is very easy to access and the possibilities are endless. Besides that, the support team is outstanding which I why I will definitely recommend this app!"
"The end-user experience of uploading with this app is the best that you will find. Users can see a progress bar in the upload button, and then see the actual upload on screen. We needed some custom features and hired the creator of the app for a very fair rate too."
"the integration with Shopify is very easy and the support from Adroll has been very fast, efficient and friendly. It seems that Adroll really values the customer experience and the user experience of this platform"
Ases Chemical Works When you use a shipping aggregator the main thing you should look at is how helpful the team is in resolving our complaints. I can confidently say they are one of the best and having used shiprocket I can say shyplite is much better. Even the interface is very concise and that is the main factor which attracted me towards it
"maybe that's my network's problem, I need more time to test it. and I need to zoom out to see the whole app interface in my chrome."
"Extremely simple and fully functional interface. Fantastic support. Very minimal discrepancy issues. Far better than Shiprocket. Been usingShyplite for some months now. Very satisfied. Rates are not the best always, however, we use it for close to 70% of our daily shipments."
"Very useful app...easy to connect, customizable, good interface...we recommend this application. keep up :)"
"Their customer support is excellent, quick response to any problem. Simple User Interface. Great for startups and a very dedicated support team for technical and other support."
"Disappointed with this app. I initially had really high hopes - interface-wise, it looked the best among similar apps and had the most logical process (although it takes a while to get the hang of it but once you do, it's great) the app has a LOT of bugs that cannot be fixed. Customer service is extremely slow and I would wait weeks to get a response back (yes, while paying 50$ a month which is a very high price for a half functioning app). In the end, they couldn't give me what I needed and neither were they willing to offer a refund despite my requests for taking long to get back to me and not solving my problems. Other apps I've dealt with offer refunds immediately if their app doesn't meet your needs. Also, make sure to check compatibility with other apps you are using. This app also turned out to be incompatible with a multi-country pricing app I was using."
"""The app is easy to use and has a very intuitive and clean interface. It sorts our products according to our business rules and saves us a lot of time organising our collections, which we had never been able to devote enough time to. I like how we can schedule the sorts according to our needs and have seen an uplift in our conversion rates. Overall, I think this is a fantastic merchandising solution for Shopify stores to increase sales and conversions."""
"I have been exploring this app for several months. The developers have been very responsive any bugs that have cropped up.  
I have moving away from BOLD apps and had a very bad experience with their product builder app. This app has a better interface, updates quicker, and is has the extremely critical feature of image overlays.   (We have a very customization product that would have required thousands of individual images to represent correctly).
The app is a bit young, but they are actively making improvements.  I will update this review after we have it live for several months."
I needed to have an age verification pop up on my site and this app had one done in a blink of an eye. Easy interface and simple integration!
The best tracking app out there. The interface and the customer experience 17track gives is marvelous. I highly recommend it for people starting out and for experienced ecom owners as well. It's next to perfect.
"非常棒的售后，界面也好看，强烈推荐。基本不需要你做什么有要求跟客服美女说就行了。啥都能满足。必须好评
Very good after sales, nice interface, highly recommended. Basically, you don't have to do anything. You just have to talk to the customer service girl. Everything is enough. Must be good
짱짱한 애프터에도 인터페이스가 보기 좋으니 강추.당신이 할 일이 거의 없다. 고객 서비스 미녀에게 말해 달라고 하면 된다.무엇이든 만족할 수 있다.반드시 호평을 받아야 한다.
とても素敵なアフターサービスで、インターフェースもきれいなので、強くお勧めします。何をしてほしいのか、担当の美人に言う必要はほとんどありません。何でも満足できる。評価しなければならない"
"The interface is easy to use and the live chat is very responsive and helpful, and most importantly, it's cheap. I will definitely keep using this app. Love it."
"I can't say enough good things about this app. The ability to add custom fields that display on each product (using the chrome extension) is something you can't live without. The help page is probably the best and  most complete support pages I've seen in an app. I haven't had to reach out to the developer at all. There are so many features in this app, I haven't had a chance to explore them all. Extremely friendly interface for those of us that are less-experienced with coding."
"With Happy Ending we changed the text at checkout to match the language across our site, and used the twitter and facebook boxes to make the purchase social and shareable. Above all we love the interface, being able to see what it looks like 'on' and 'off' makes us certain of what our customers are seeing.We have already seen the impact on twitter with people tweeting their purchase! 
Disclaimer: We worked with Simple Apps to produce this App."
"Such an easy-to-use app with a wonderful interface!! Also, I reached out with a question and I got a response and a solution! Evi was kind enough to code the exact design I had in mind. I appreciate your commitment to your beautiful creation! Wish you guys all the success! :) - M"
"Rockerbox is an excellent tool for truly understanding your marketing channels and how they are working. I've used several different attribution platforms as well as various internal logic algorithms over my 10 years in Marketing Analytics and Rockerbox has been the most transparent, versatile and reliable. Marketing online is expensive and an intelligent attribution method is the only way to make sure your dollar is helping your business. This tool is surprisingly easy to use and the support staff is excellent. It's customizable and allows us to answer nearly any question we can think of. It seamlessly integrates with our DW and allows for even more in depth analysis. That being said the platform itself on it's own and out of the box has nearly every helpful visualization you can think of, including some you likely haven't thought to analyze before. In the time we've been using it there are have been several features added to make things even better none of which we requested or realized we needed prior to them being rolled out. On top of that the user interface is fast. It's been instrumental in the optimization of our business. Highly recommended."
"The app does what it says and it's customisable. Service is quick, effective and friendly. User interface needs some further design work but other than that the app is great."
"Ezra and his team have been incredibly helpful. Setup is quite simple, and they're quick to respond to special requests and help we needed. Clean interface, sharp design, big step up from Shopify's severely limited default customer account portal. Customer Accounts Hub is well worth it!"
"I would highly recommend this App to anyone looking to be able to offer returns. As a UK based business, we looked through various options, and decided to go for clicksit. The team are incredibly supportive and far outdid any expectations - making the setup easy, quick and with everything needed. Being able to offer returns with a reliable and well known method such as collect + really builds consumer confidence in the online shopping experience and the system within clicksit to create returns labels seriously couldn't be easier. It is super streamlined and fuss free. The returns request page seamlessly fits into our online store with our own url which makes it completely integrated and a very smooth user experience. Zero negatives to add - brilliant service. (And I know if anything came up, the team respond very quickly to any queries)."
This app is amazing and has a great user interface. The app also provides great customer service with very quick responses to questions.
"Excellent application )) Everything is simple and clear, user-friendly interface, installation help from the app support! Recommend)"
"Amazing APP. setup is so simple and user friendly. The staff are always on hand to help if required, but so far I haven't needed them. My customers will be very happy with the user experience provided. Grant (4Gingz Ltd)"
"From a designer perspective this app is very limiting as far as what you can customize and achieve.
Also the user experience is poor.
I'm sure it does a good job collecting emails and leads, but I can't get past the user experience and lack of customization."
"At the best, Cartback Messenger Remarketing helped us recover as much as 10 sales in one day, so this was highly valuable! The interface would need some extra work but all in all I would recommend it as an essential remarketing tool."
"I am super surprised with all the features of this app, which is really useful if you are chase for conversion/user experience/boost sales. Highly recommended! Apart from that , the technical team are really responsible. they fixed the issue as soon as I contact them ."
"Shipstation is great. It provides all sorts of ways to help us organize our workflow in our retail small business. We do lots of pre-orders, local pickup, and have many different staff with hands on our product. Being able to tag orders and comment within the program drastically helps our workflow. The ability to connect a scale directly to the software and weigh items is key. Plus, we can compare different carrier rates instantaneously to determine the lowest cost. With the ability to scan/verify orders via Shopify barcodes to the easy interface and ability to sort to their guaranteed best rates (I've compared), Shipstation provides the best and most robust shipping software out there."
"The stellar customer service alone makes this Shopify's best Order Printer Template app. We have been so thrilled with the quality of our packing slip design! The team at FORSBERG+two has done its best to implement virtually every tweak or change we have needed in a timely and thorough fashion. The user interface is simple, the behind the scenes code installation is streamlined, and we are thrilled we found this app and use it every day for manufacturing and orders. If you are searching for your next template for order printing needs- look no further! This is the one for you."
Have been using this app for the last couple of months and it just works! The backend user interface is user-friendly and it was straightforward and simple setting up the re-direct. Their support team was quick in responding to queries and troubleshooting.
"In under 30 minutes this app allowed me to: edit different styles of Invoice templates so I could print samples to see which one suits my business best; purchase a complete set for invoices, returns, packing slips, and gift cards; and get back to running my business. Super simple interface that produces a polished product. 10/10 recommend!"
"So far so good. Great, actually! 
Clean and simple interface, fully functional.
Lovely work by the developers."
"Intuitive interface, easy to install, smart product recommendation, responsive support team: a very great app."
"Nice app. The interface needs improvement. But works great for simple personalizations options, easy to configure."
This app is a well-done piece of software. The user experience is 5 stars. The App delivers on the promise.
"Ich war anfangs sehr von Shirtee und dessen Produktvielfalt überzeugt. Zwar war das Interface noch nie sehr nutzerfreundlich, es funktioniert aber einwandfrei. Man merkt auch, dass an der App und dessen Übertragung gearbeitet wird, so hat Shirtee vor kurzem die Cloud mit automatisierter Zahlung z.b. via Paypal integriert. Trotzdem: Bei vielen Bestellungen haben meine Kunden falsche Produkte zugeschickt bekommen. Zu dem wurde mehrfach vergessen z.b. bei beidseitigem Motiv die Rückseite zu bedrucken. So lässt sich leider keine Marke aufbauen, wenn euch ständig Fehler unterlaufen und meine Kundenbindung darunter leidet. Deswegen habe ich mich für einen anderen POD Anbieter entschieden, der technisch weiter entwickelt und wahrscheinlich auch deswegen zuverlässiger ist."
Amazing app with perfect customer service! Very easy to use interface. Will definitely continue to use it.
"Shopify app is a must have for anyone, the interface is quite similar to Shopify so I feel like I can adapt to it faster. The layout library is limited but you can design almost anything to your liking. The price is also very affordable, I can use the Free plan and it meets my needs."
"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS APP!
Would give 0 stars if possible.
List of bad stuff:
- Does not save your changes (only sometimes it will save)
- Has a mind of its own
- Clunky interface
- Not instinctive to use
- Awful customer support (just want to send you youtube videos)
I would not trust these guys to integrate with my shopify store and start creating invoices etc if they cannot create some user friendly software to do something relatively simple.
WORST APP I HAVE USED ON SHOPIFY - PRESUMABLY FAKE REVIEWS GIVING 5*"
"Amazing App!!!! It saves me a lot of time and is quick and easy to install. Great interface, very easy to use."
"This tool is amazing. It's so hard to do bulk edits in Shopify, even using a CSV file. This app makes it (relatively) easy, and there's a nicely designed user interface too."
"Awsome APP! Great Support! 
I RECOMAND THIS APP! 
I installed this app for the tab description because my theme didn't support tab description. 
Super user friendly interface and i had great support from the team! 
Perfect for organising your description"
This app is fantastic! And nothing like it on the shopify apps! It solved our problem very quickly! Interface was easy and installed in literally 2 minutes! Customer support is fast and SUPER helpful. Thank you so much!
"Lyman, answered tons of questions for me. Excellent customer service, and the interface seems easier to use than some of the other POD apps.Im looking forward to getting some samples to check out the quality and to see how the packaged items look when shipped."
Great app! Really love how easy it is to use and the interface is awesome also! Would highly recommend to others
"I use this app to track my data for my Facebook Ads. This app attributes 60-80% off my purchase, better than my previous situation that was 0%. Fast to install and set-up. Super strong support. I set up a few things incorrectly and they help me in a few second to set everything up. Really easy user interface."
Great app and great customer service. They answers my concerns right away and help me make special configurations that are not possible within the app interface. Highly recommended
Beside the great improvement to the user experience and thus the potential growth of the seller profit - the non customer service is exceptional.
"Highly recommended! showing direct impact on sales from the very beginning. With an easy to use interface and innovative features, we have been able to create personalized recommendations, smart banners and interactive content that generated engagement to our users and generated sales."
"Muy buena experiencia, la interface es muy amigable e intuitiva y siempre tuve a un representante vía WhatsApp que me apoyó en todo momento. La sincronización de mis pedidos es inmediata y ahorro mucho tiempo en la programación de los envíos y dinero ya que las tarifas que me ofrecen son mejores que ir directamente con la paquetería."
"In general, it's a great app, that simplifies the process of logistics and being able to work with different couriers from one interface. The interface is good and easy to use. This part of it is great and can't complain much about it. However, there are some things that can be made more customizable and better for more advanced businesses users. The restriction of only 3 couriers can be restrictive as in mexico the situation is a lot complicated and depending on the region there are better providers than others, hence the ability to have more than 3 and choose different providers based on location would be great. To be able to customize the name of the provider or the ability to show shipping times would also be great. Also to have a feature to do some postcode validations would be great."
"You need AMP to survive in the crazy world of ecommerce and Shop Sheriff delivers in spades. The interface is easy to use and will allow you to have AMP delivered pages in a matter of minutes, that match your site. Support for this app is awesome, thanks to Mark and Stephen. They will get your issue or an issue that Google reports quickly addressed and fixed."
Great app & excellent support. We've been able to add complex product information that can be easily maintained via the admin interface.
"We needed an app to add non-standard product metadata that also provided a very easy interface to make edits and add additional fields so we wouldn't always have to bother our developer to make changes. Metafields Manager was quick and easy to work with, has a simple interface and the Metafields team was extremely responsive to answer questions and address any concerns we had."
Jason was more than helpful in getting this app set up on our site & walking me through the process so that I am able to move forward independently. I chose this app with the goal to decrease the amount of text in our product descriptions. We now use Metafields Manager to to have our Brand Descriptions as a clickable 'link'. When our customers click 'About the Brand' a little pop-up will display with more details. Great interface and easy to use after a little walkthrough/direction.
"Great app for anyone who wants to add extra data to your website. Also helps website to manage all the data in an easy-to-use interface including descriptions, images, html code, and much more. If you have experience with adding custom code to your shopify template, its a very useful app. Highly recommend!
Thank you,

"UPDATE 1/1/2022: It pains me to have to update this negatively but this service does not live up to the promises that they had for their brand partners. The design interface is AWESOME and more than that, their pricing for CUT AND SEW garments was so competitive that despite the less than ideal delivery times, the quality and pricing made the weight worth it. But now, it looks like they aren't even around anymore. I had been a regular customer of theirs for a long time and now can't get any emails back about when they will be resuming production and their website isn't even live anymore. It looks as if the company's owners have gotten themselves into some hot water, which might explain why things seem to have dropped cold. I really DO hope that new investors can take the reigns here and bring this back because I TRULY did like the products and the pricing. ------------------ I have tried a few different POD services so far and some leave a lot to be desired in terms of quality and customization. What I do love about Skyou is the design interface, I haven't seen any other POD services using one like it and it really is fantastic at being able to truly customize your garments. Another is that its 100% cut and sew which means no printing irregularities that you generally get with dye sublimation on blank garments. The pricing for cut and sew tanks and teeshirts here is really not any more expensive than what you would get for dye sub on blank garments elsewhere. I love that I can truly customize every single garment. The mockup generator is fantastic, I love that its 3D mockups and you can see the garment in every single direction. The design tool has FAR FAR more options for customizing than any other that I've tried. The disadvantages is the time it takes to get things. I have mostly ordered samples for myself so far but I have had about a half dozen customers buy tees/tanks from me as well. The turnaround time for customers to get their products tends to be about 30 days, which for a cut and sew garment is somewhat justifiable but at the same time, customers don't like waiting 30 days to get a teeshirt. Customer service for me with them has been great, I've gotten the best customer service from their team more than any other POD I've used previously. I will say that it seems like much of the delay in getting items is due to some kind of production issue they found during quality control inspection, which I 100% appreciate that they take such care in making sure the garments are what they should be. I would say if you primarily do single color teeshirts or tanks with a single design on the front or back, Skyou may not be for you, as you can get those types of garments with a faster turnaround time elsewhere. If you are looking to do completely cut/sew garments that don't look like the usual dye sub teeshirts then Skyou is great. I've been incredibly satisfied with all the samples I've gotten for myself and the teeshirts look very professional quality. The yoga pants are really great, the leggings I wasn't as satisfied overall with the density of the fabric used. I do use another service for women's skirts and dresses and I would like to see Skyou expand its selection of women's apparel so that I can use them more exclusively (and really Skyou, a simple stretch pencil skirt/mini skirt or body con dress isn't that complicated to draft or make). My apparel sales aren't alot at this point to where the slower fulfillment time is currently an issue but going forward, it may be easier to get a larger wholesale order made and then sell it direct from my own website instead of the make on demand option. So if you have need for very large order fulfillment and you want to have a fast turnaround time with your orders, your better option may be to just place a large wholesale order with them and sell off the inventory yourself."
"The app itself is nice and does what it says it will do. At first you are overwhelmed because there are so many options/outcomes with this app. It has a lot of potential depending on how intense you want to customize your shop. We just wanted to add additional product photos to our product pages that weren’t in the carousel. Ideally, it would be nice to not have to rely on the app to include these images once the meta fields were set up and just use shopify’s product page. Maybe thats something to look into for the future if shopify allows it. There seems to be a lot of restrictions with shopify and this is a work around. We watched the walkthrough video the app provides, which was helpful, and the documentation was pretty clear to help you do the tasks you wanted to do.  The interface of the app is nice and clean. No real complaints on our end and Jason responded within 5 minutes when we sent an email asking question about the app. Seems like there is good customer service if we run into any issues."
Excellent app and great support! This app has given me the flexibility to build my store exactly the way I want. The interface is clean and intuitive. I especially like how it generates copy-and-paste code snippets for a product's metafields. This is a must-have for my shop and anybody else who wants to build a dynamic site.
Great app that improves the user experience of your product pages. responsive helpful support too. highly recommended.
"This is an immature APP and needs to be strengthened～But if you use css, the interface will be better and come on."
"We like the app. 
It is a good substitute to the regular Blog editor on Shopify, with more options and a better user experience
I had a compatibility issue between my theme and the app, and the team took care of it quickly, which is nice.
I recommend it."
I love how the interface is really easy to edit. I'd definitely be using this for the rest of my stores :)
"App interface is perfect and the options are limitless, sticky cart bar and sticky cart are awesome."
"I had some problems with the atc button, the click function did not work properly. But the dev team fixed this in a few minutes! Really love the interface"
The user interface of the app is great. It is easy to use and comes with a variety of templates to choose from. Gives a blog page a very neat and professional structure. After sales experience has been great and it is pretty much instant. It should be an essential app for every shopify user. 5 stars..
"Great app, easy to install and provides a better customer user experience. Brian responded instantly to queries I had. Great support!"
"Really great costumer service! Mohit was super friendly and very efficient. He helped me solve an issue with my interface in seconds. It's a great app, so many cool features all in one - just what I needed!"
"This app has been a lifesaver for us! So glad we found it. The interface is easy to use and understand, and we're very happy with the features it provides! Our customers are loving it. Also, the customer service is outstanding! Someone gets back to you quickly and answers questions thoroughly. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to provide website visitors an easy-to-use, visually stunning map on their site!"
"[Update] I had a problem with this app. I contacted the support and within 1 day it was fixed.
Simply amazing.
------
I initially worried about creating good looking blogs using Shopify's standard blog interface.
But this solves that problem with simple drag and drop interface.
Great work"
"Comes from the sky the exact right time.Something like the Avengers of Shopify apps.
We've recently created our blog in our e-shop and we found the basic Shopify blog page builder very unattractive with minimum possibilities. But here came the Blog Studio to save the day and lift the post build possibilities to the maximum. 
Comes with a user-friendly interface, beautiful templates and of course fully customizable, on a drag&drop studio that motivates you to post.
ShopPad, you may be new to the game but it seems that you understand what an e-commerce business needs and how you give it to them. 
Keep up the good work and never stop improving."
"Great app, many useful functions that are able to enhance the user experiences. Great prompt customer service and worry-free thus far."
"What a massive improvement this is on the standard Shopify blog. It's easy-to-use interface makes creating your aesthetic simple and sleek!
Doesn't get a whole 5 Star (but if I could give it 4 1/2 I would!) as it could use a couple of things to polish it up, we had an initial issue with the posts not optimising for mobile sizes, but the support team were on it and fixed it up within 24 hours of access! Very Impressed!
Overall, would highly recommend and feel this app has had a positive impact on our blog posts!"
Great app! Did exactly as described. It has a very easy-to-use interface which made setting up a breeze
This app has been fantastic! Everything you need for a seamless user experience for the customer. The support team was quick and efficient and easily helped me tweak a few things to suit my stores needs or answer questions I had. Set up is easy and straight forward. Highly recommend.
"I cannot believe how impressive this application is. I am so thankful for the well-thought-out and straightforward user interface. They haven't missed a detail and use a much more creative approach. This is the only application for pop-ups that I feel an online business can depend on without any strings attached. I used to use Privy, and they let me down with their additional costs. Their user interface is no match against Getsitecontrol. I've spent hours searching for an excellent pop-up system and finally found this one here. Thank you!"
"I rarely leave reviews, but this one deserves it! I have been using the application for 1 year already, 3 stores are connected, it is really very convenient, excellent interface, super technical support! And the main thing is that there are excellent templates for sending messages so that customers leave feedback, it works! Yusuf - my priority manager! Thank YOU!"
"The pop-ups are a really clean design and look very professional on-site. The user interface is really intuitive and easy to use.
However, both of these strengths pale into insignificance against the absolutely exceptional support provided. I genuinely can't praise the support team highly enough for the help they provided in setting up my bespoke requirements."
"I used to love this app, now I did install it on my new shop and can't even figure out how to embed it. Seems they are focused more on upselling than user experience."
"Could be one in few, but nothing in the app's interface worked.
I was only able to change what the text said, and nothing else.
I tried several times and different browsers. - Ben"
"We've been using Katana for a couple months now after switching from another MRP solution, and we're extremely happy with the transition. The user interface and work flow is intuitive and required essentially zero time to learn. Tracking batches/lots is efficient and has reduced labor substantially. There have been a few minor kinks where we've needed to develop a workaround, but the customer support is phenomenal -- very helpful and quick to respond. Highly recommend."
"We switched our MRP system over to Katana this year. With our quantity of materials and products, the migration project of our existing material / product / recipe data from our old system was significant but Katana's import functionality made it doable. The ease of use of Katana is great and it's simple interface allows all of our managers to easily get their jobs done. The real-time inventory integration with Shopify is the largest selling point of Katana and it has worked flawlessly. All of our Shopify locations are sync'ed properly with Katana locations and what we see for location stock quantity in Shopify always matches what Katana shows. I have talked with many of their developers and tech support and they have always been incredibly responsive and helpful. They have eagerly listened to my suggestions and wishlist items and with this being relatively young software, I really look forward to their future product development and new features. I have already taken care of a couple of our workflow pain points using their brand new Zapier integration and they just introduced their API. Now for the cons: There is no Etsy sales channel support. We have an old Etsy site that we continue to maintain and have had to develop (partially manual) workflows to deal with the lack of direct Etsy support in Katana. This software was clearly designed with a different manufacturing workflow than we use in our industry. Every recipe is defined on a ""per each"" basis so all of our batch recipes have to be manually converted and input into Katana. Katana needs the ability to allow batch recipe input with an expected yield. In turn, when a manufafacture is complete there is no way to input an actual yield versus the expected yield which results in needing to add manual stock adjustments for proper material removal during manufactures. For us, this is at least 50% of our manufactures and causes a lot of time consuming manual work. All in all, the Katana software and company are great and highly recommended!"
"As a small manufacturer, we use Katana to keep track of inventory parts including both raw materials and finished products. PROS: - really easy to use, great interface - support is responsive, although we didn't have much need for support thanks to a very thorough and detailed knowledge base - reasonably priced compared to other inventory management systems - good integrations with Shopify, Quickbooks, etc - it made inventory tracking a lot easier for us as a manufacturer. The manhours saved on doing Excel updates to inventory would definitely cost more if you run complex operations CONS: - It doesn't work well for Shopify bundle products, can only track vanilla products - It doesn't have a multicurrency feature for purchase orders (when you buy inventory in a currency different from your main currency) - It's not easy to account for freight costs in the costs of buying raw materials - You can't work in 2 browser tabs without paying for 2 users, this can be a little frustrating"
"This app has allowed us to track all of our raw materials into finished goods. From procurement, to manufacturing, to selling products and tracking purchase and sales orders. It integrates well with our eCommerce and accounting platforms as well. Clean interface. Only qualm is with mapping raw materials to finished goods - there's some automation that needs to be worked out with this, but I believe they're working on an update to do just that."
"Katana has revolutionised our business. We are now able to accurately cost our manufacturing, have everyone know exactly when materials will be in and how long before products are ready. As a small business this has saved us countless hours and headaches.  
It is a bit of a learning curve though, and a slightly smoother integration with shopify and shipping (dpd, royal mail etc) interface would be really helpful, hence the taking off one star."
This is a very simple app to set up and an even easier one to use. It has an easy interface and lots of free options.
"USO is the lynchpin of my store right now, and it is working exceptionally well for me. I had some custom workflows in mind which I needed help to implement so I paid for Premium Onboarding, I was hesitant to spend before my store really took off, but it was one of the best decisions I made. 
Sara was fantastic in understanding my requirements, and translating what I said in layman terms to what was required in code. I did not have to explain much about user experience because Sara understood it. It was great having someone to bounce off some of my ideas and refine them. Sara was always prompt to respond to my queries and help me achieve what I needed. Thank you Sara, and the shop would not be where it is, if it wasn't for your help.
In my opinion, I have yet to fully unlock the power of USO and I have many more ideas in my head to implement i.e. custom bundles for re-targeting audiences, email marketing offers triggered by unique links etc. Excited to try out more stuff!"
"This app includes items that have been cancelled or refunded, even though it is marked quantity 0, this is very confusing on the receipt printed. Any time the order is edited to add/remove items, this app prints out both the removed items and new items. It also doesn't work on iphone, so you must use the desktop interface to print your packing slips. Needs improvement."
"This is the best free app I've installed on my store. It seemed too basic at first but after some tinkering, what I love about it now is how you can customize the templates. After customizations, I can now print an invoice with only the info I want and the address label in one long sheet of paper which I find very economical. 
The downside of customizing though is that you'd have to have some knowledge of how to edit the templates using the liquid variables on their list. Not everyone knows how to do that. If the editing interface was click and type or WYSWYG  it would have been perfect."
"easy to use with a simple interface. using on all 3 of my shopify websites. I would recommend, very cost effective."
"This app really helps to solve gaps in Shopify, like bulk refunds. At first, I found the process a bit hard to navigate. However, 5 big stars for their support team. They offer email AND a slack channel to guide you personally. Leva was outstanding at quick, real-time support for me. She walked me step by step to success. I'm extremely grateful for her help and this interface."
"I love how this app tighly integrates with Shopify. It doesn't launch a whole new set of windows, like some kind of external program. It flows seamlessly with the Shopify interface. Because of Shopify's disconnect with Amazon, I have a mess on my hands with duplicate orders, so Matrixify comes to the rescue. I just use this app to dump all my orders, and then I can weed out the dups in Excel. Same thing when needing to adjust prices on Shopify....Much nicer to do it in Excel, and let Matrixify suck it all back in and perform the updates. Works like it should, runs fast, and support has been great."
"Very handy app, does what it says on the tin, and the interface is clean and tidy too. Thanks to Naren for support."
"I have tested 4 variant option apps, and this Relentless Variant Option app is by far the best for my store. This app allows me to offer customers the ability to customize products effortlessly before adding them to the shopping cart. The app integrates well with native Shopify options and allows the shop owner limitless customizations and virtual options. The interface is well thought out and adding products and options is seamless. The ultimate goal is to make shopping easier for prospective customers as a means to increase conversion rate. This app makes that a reality and I am thankful to be able to run it on my store. Additionally, service is crazy good. I mean it, best I have experienced from any Shopify app company large or small. Seriously good service!"
"great tracking app, i have implemented this app on all my stores. user friendly interface and customizable tracking page with blacklist routing. professional customer service. would recommend!"
"I think it is a great app. Simple, well designed, user interface and accomplishes what it claims. I will continue to use it if I can increase my sales enough to justify the expense."
The best SEO app I've used. Easy interface and works really well for my company. I love this application!
"I highly recommend this app. The installation could not be easier, and the interface with your site is flawless."
"Customer service is very fast and kind. lovely interface, and wonderful support. Best tracking app out!
Would highly recommend it."
"Loved the experience.Superb mobility and interface,Thanks for creating an app.Really helps startups like us to convert our small businesses to revenue models"
"Super easy to use and beauty interface like no other app!
100 % I will recommend this app since I've been searching for an app like this for a long time."
customer support is awesome. I havent used this app long enough to get user experience but i believe it will be very good.
"Absolutely brilliant app with a very reasonable monthly subscription. Some competitors charge double the price for a much more complicated interface. I have set mine up for my online sweet shop, that also offers Pick N Mix which requires customers to be able to click multiple sweet options. This app has made it look professional and very easy for my customers to use. On the very odd occasion I have needed to contact support, for changing a colour scheme etc, and my request was answered within a few hours. I was sent a code that needed to be added to my liquid.theme and within minutes I had sorted the issue. Extremely friendly customer services."
"lovely interface, and wonderful support. Best tracking app out there!!! We will be using them for plenty of time to come :)"
Excellent app. I was able to set options for my variants in no time. The user experience of our website became so much better now. I really recommend this app to anyone who has complex products that require several variants.
Really like this app. A multitude of options to tweak the user experience. Great integration with my online shop.
Exactly what I was looking for. This software has an extremely simple interface that you can get up and running in mere minutes. And it also has enough complexity to allow me to run impactful questionnaires that are making an immediate difference for my business. I love that you can do a trial and get real results during the trial period. And if you want to continue afterwards the pricing is completely fair and reasonable. Support is phenomenal (one of the best I've ever used) and they are open to feedback and suggestions. 10/10 would recommend.
"A lot of options available, and a really professional interface. A must-have app, highly recommended if you want to keep your customers happy! App saved me so much time and money!"
"Solid app, easy interface, very quick and friendly support from Varun. Easy to use and works flawlessly, default settings look good."
Top app! Great features. Super easy interface and nice to work with. I have great results from it. I highly recommend.
"After extensive research and testing various apps, I can confidently say this is the best and most versatile app for Product Labels and Badges (hence the name). The functionality and customization options are well put together and simply work; great for any store. Due to the customization on our theme, we needed additional support. I reached out to their support team and they were incredibly quick and professional. Both Gigi (support) and Tien Loc (technician) assisted with additional customization that would be outside the general scope of work for most apps. They were quick, detail oriented, and asked questions I didn't even consider. I am truly thankful for their help and to have found this app. We have seen great results by providing key information to our customers, making both the shopping and user experience better."
We have been working with Gigi Nguyen (Customer Support) and Ngoc Hue (Designer) to develop new banners. Their response time and enthusiasm to assist us has been nothing short of excellent! This app offers very good features based on its pricing structure (we are using the advance plan) in comparison with other similar apps. The interface is intuitive and its easy to use. You can use it to develop your own banners and badges quite simply. Highly recommended!!
Great and easy interface. The developers reached out to me regarding an issue with the store that I didn't know of and fixed it for free!
"This app is awesome. It is the perfect way for us to transfer products back and forth between Etsy and Shopify, and it keeps our inventory synced by creating orders in Shopify where we can print shipping labels and fulfill orders. Easy to use and nice interface."
"This is the best app I’ve tried (and am still using!) for syncing my products from Shopify to any channel. I’ve tried many other apps that sync to other channels (or only to Etsy). Other sync apps are either too simple, waaayyyy too expensive and/or don’t do anything that I can’t do myself with a csv import. Of course, you can’t do a csv import to Etsy (shame on Etsy!), which is why I was looking for a product sync solution. The Shuttle interface is excellent. It’s easy to understand, easy to set up and easy to use for syncing. Don’t let that fool you - Shuttle has a lot of flexibility in how you can set up your product syncs. You can set flexible rules to manage how your Shopify product details are sent to Etsy. Shuttle does more than simply copy your Shopify data, which I greatly appreciate! For example, I was able to append different product description text specific to Etsy, automatically strip HTML tags from my Shopify description, auto strip description text I didn’t want on Etsy, auto-change my HTML bullet lists into plain text, set up Etsy tags instead of using my Shopify tags, set the standard Etsy fields based on my own rules and more. I also like that I was able to change the Etsy price automatically with Shuttle. If the Etsy API has the property available, Shuttle will let you configure it to your needs. Honestly, there are too many features I appreciate to describe in a review! So far, I have used Shuttle to set up and sync 115 products from my Shopify store to Etsy. Since I am setting up my products on my new Etsy Shop (EarthSongJewelryShop), Shuttle has been a huge help. The only things I need to do manually on Etsy for my products are: add the category-specific fields that Etsy does not allow apps to access (this is Etsy’s bad policy) and set my image alt-text fields for SEO. I wish that could be done via an app, but Etsy does not expose those fields via their API - so no one can access them except by manually editing on Etsy. Oh - I also want to mention that support is excellent thus far. I was initially testing Shuttle out (not paid yet) and found that I couldn’t auto-strip some common text from my Shopify descriptions before syncing them to Etsy. I was amazed that Shuttle immediately ADDED this functionality to their app based on my support ticket! That is great! Now I am able to strip out those lines of text I don’t want on Etsy. Personally, I found the information about what was included with each plan very clear. I have signed up for the $9/month “Standard” plan. After testing out other solutions, this is truly a great price for a great app!
Thanks much!

"This App is really great. It has Multiple features like advanced filters, sorting, search behavior, and screen layouts for product pages. The service and support were excellent. Giang from the advanced search filter app has been very helpful and made sure that our website theme works with this app.
I would definitely recommend this app if you need advanced features on your website to make your user experience better."
"Very very good and free function!! The staff are very patient to answer our questions and help us to solve them, the user experience is very good, highly recommended!"
"This app used to work fabulously managing inventory across my Etsy and Shopify store when it was simpler and called Syncr. Since becoming Shuttle, this app has caused so many issues which have not been easily resolved. The new interface is extremely confusing - too many options. I have updated this review from a 1 star to 3 stars because the developer responded to me and it appears to be working currently (after several failed inventory moments which resulted in items being oversold)"
"I have used (what was formerly Etsify and now Shuttle) since the end of 2018 and it is hands down an ESSENTIAL app if you manage an Etsy shop in addition to a Shopify Storefront! In fact if I only could choose one, this would be it. Don’t waste your time trying to find another app to manage transferring your reviews/products from Etsy to Shopify. This is the one you want to invest in. The interface is extremely simple and easy to use and the new features are PERFECT. I’d like to point out that the nearly 100% of any negative reviews Shuttle has gotten thus far have to do with “support” — which I can personally say has not been my experience at all. Nimo has been extremely helpful and responsive any time I’ve needed any assistance and I can tell that he truly cares about his work! As someone that manages all aspects of my own business (as I’m sure a lot of Shopify stores do) I think it’s insane that people are so quick to leave 1 star reviews undeservingly. Not sure if Nimo has help or not, but I think he’s doing a wonderful job to provide us with an absolutely innovative, essential tool at a fair price AND manage his support. I think Shuttle deserves more than 5 stars! Thank you so much for your hard work, Nimo! I truly cannot wait to see how Shuttle continues to evolve! PS - I was NOT coaxed in to leaving this review with any kind of incentive and my opinion is 100% my own. My Shopify store is theurbanflair.com and my Etsy shop is theurbanflair.etsy.com — I am PROUD to be a paying customer"
This one wins the 'Best Shopify App that I have used so far' Award. Excellent intuitive interface and top notch support.
"I like the simplicity of this app - very easy interface, extra points for being able to upload your own gift wrap image and choose colors for the buttons. Def recommend!"
I'm using this app. It looks like a great app for Indian Users. Doesn't bound you to pay monthly charges and you pay as you use is best for my kind of business approach. Just work on interface a lil bit and you should have a great product for ppl like me.
The backend user interface of the app is friendly and the options are easy to set up. We were also really impressed with the speed and responsiveness to our questions - we wrote in on a couple of issues and they were all solved quickly by the team!
Emma was very helpful in resolving our issue. She created a step by step video guide! The interface is clean & easy to use.
"Quite possibly the worst app we've ever used. Here are the list of reasons:
Basic Plan - No view of all features that require upgrade
No sound user experience AT ALL
No visual hierarchy, proper grouping, primary vs secondary vs tertiary buttons, lacks contrast or signifiers for understanding the UI
Extremely lacks explanations of null states for all kinds of features or pages
No distinction between working with sales reps vs affiliates
What the heck are sales team templates?
Feature toggle switches are unreadable
Can't use our own Shopify tags for assigning existing customers to reps
Reports are small and don't make sense in null state
Email us page should have a contact form. Doesn't even have a ""mailto"" deeplink to open email client
Calendly page title shows ""CSS advanced support"" as if any beginner would understand that
FAQ accordions just look like plain text and have no UX signifiers like dropdown arrows
YouTube instructional videos have no proper grouping headings such as ""Getting Started.""
Accept/Deny Sales Rep page makes absolutely no sense. Is this for affiliates?
So many more bad UX issues to list!
Just the worst app, period. Unusable, in and out. NOTE TO THE DEVELOPER: I'll be glad to consider using your app when these issues are fixed. Make it USABLE!"
"EPROLO POD is amazing. The products are superb and branding them is extremely easy. The shipping is second to none. Everything about EPROLO POD makes me smile. Easy and fast interface 24/7 customer service, 100 % recomendable."
"This platform is the best! I use this to easily connect cool products to my store. I have had no issues with the function, and highly recommend. Easy and fast interface, service 24/7 all the year! Very beginner friendly."
"I am in the process of setting up the App but the administrators at Sales Team- Specifically Vik have been a tremendous help. While I can't yet speak to the entire user experience, I can certainly attest to the fact that these guys are very accessible and ready to assist in whatever way needed. Thanks Vik and team!"
"Amazing integration. I can't imagine anything easier. EPROLO POD's design interface is super easy and comparable to others. I can find so many items like t-shirts, bags, mockups, even bedding on their system! Can’t wait to use it, it has so many features!!!"
"I really wanted to like it... the interface is well designed and intuitive. But there were way too many bugs for me to rely on it. Customer data didn't sync properly with Shopify, and it isn't obvious if there's a way to sync data between the email and CRM apps. Many crashes/freezes as well. It seems the technical side is holding back what could be a really high value proposition here."
"This initially looked like a good Mailchimp alternative - I like the pricing model and wish more newsletter providers used it. 
Pros: Clean interface, nice reports and the helpdesk exists, is responsive and really works to understand the issue
Cons: all of the embedded forms are buggy within Shopify - some won't even submit while others kinda work but the error checking (like duplicate registration) goes to a blank screen. This was issue #1 with the help desk which was finally identified after a few weeks but put on the backlog with no fix date.
The final straw was the previously undisclosed minimum number of subscribers to be allowed to send a campaign.  So despite the pricing model being tiny/new business friendly, their rules aren't and weren't made clear up front. I don't know what other surprises might be lurking.
Switching back to Mailchimp..."
So easy to use. Intuitive interface filled with everything you need and nothing you don't. Allowed me to fill out my online store with a handful of additional items that I don't want to hold in inventory. Keep it up!
"I was choosing between this App (Socialhead) and another one, installed them both but chose to go with Socialhead because of the fantastic support offered whilst I was building my Widget. I was also impressed with the user friendly interface, and the end result was so gorgeous and 100% on point with my brand aesthetic. Vicky went above and beyond and was amazing, so friendly and helpful! I was simply blown away and love this product so much and how it compliments my website. Thanks again team!"
"I've been using EPROLO POD dropshipping for 2 months and it's literally the easiest POD site out there. I just started using this app but the customer service has been absolutely fantastic, they are so quick to respond, help and resolve. The interface is good."
This app is really helpful for creating complex variants and differents options + it's for free. The interface is easy to use. Thank you very much to Eric and his team for a very quick response. The developers provide their customers such a great service.
"1. Super quick responses from the developer
2. Easy to use interface
3. FREE
This is one of the best apps that I've come across."
"If you're looking for an app with a FREE plan to replace Shopify's built-in Instagram feed (that Shopify refuses to fix), this is a great option!
You can use the free version to replicate the old feed's functionality pretty closely. Unlike some of the other free options, this one actually includes REAL responsive functionality for the feed, so your images are still visible at a reasonable size on mobile devices, even if you have 6 columns configured for desktop. Some of the other free options I vetted simply scaled those 6 columns down on mobile, resulting in tiny thumbnails. In order to get actual responsiveness with those options, you needed to upgrade. On the contrary, this app's free version includes automatic changes to the row/column layout on smaller screens and is truly a responsive option.
On another note: I had to take off 1 star because the interface where I can configure my feed kept logging me out while I was trying to set it up. So I lost an in-progress configuration 2 or 3 times and had to click the App link from my Shopify admin page to get back to it. Once it's all set up, it seems to work fine though."
customer support is very fast. it also has a very good interface. I would definitely recommend. thank you very much.
I used this app to boost sales and traffic to my store! it was really easy to setup and the interface was really helpful.
"Excellent, quick response from the support team when I had an initial problem with installation - v easy to use interface."
"Very promising app with all in one AMP + PWA . it is easy to use , has clear interface and great customer support."
"I have been using the app for a while now, it is a great app with all in one AMP + PWA . it is  easy to use , has clear interface and great customer support."
Je viens d'installer l'appli donc à voir dans le temps si améliore vraiment la rapidité et le rebond. Interface facile et intuitif. Merci
This is a top quality app I have used plenty of pwa apps and amp apps in the past but this is one of the best I have cone across.. Easy to use interface with very good customer service response time.. Keep the good work up guys !
"Showcase is solid. Support is great (James), interface is clean and the application is user friendly. I've tried multiple competitors and haven't seen better. I can't wait to see what they come up with next!"
"App is very helpful for dropshipping model, it's simple to use and has a clean interface. Also realized that I could customize the review box and made one that compliments my site properly"
"Amazing app. Tried at least 5 similar before settling on this, very easy and enjoyable to use, very clean interface, works like a charm, we use it daily now and no problems at all. Maybe more importantly it is amazingly useful, easily one of the top 3 apps we have ever used in terms of effectiveness. What can be more effective than displaying happy customers using your products to your potentials? Click on an instagram pic and it is instantly transfered to your product page, that simple. And the nice thing is you can also embed people who did not buy from you but using the same product you sell, thanks to the ability to search instagram by hashtags. So your product page is full of user generated content at once. Amazing. And all for this for a fraction of the price of companies offering less functionality like being not able to have more than one gallery on some alternatives. Last but not the least James is amazingly helpful, he has responded to our every special customization request within minutes, did not see a better and more responsive service ever. Thanks guys, it is a real pleasure to use your app and to know you. Keep up the good work and soon than you may think, you will be one of the bigger ones in this ecosystem"
"We use Swatch King, Variant Image Automator, and Variant Title King to easily show different images and titles for our products based upon variants selected. The products are straightforward to customize and integrate seamlessly with the Flex 3.0.0 theme. While that would warrant 5 stars in and of itself, the best part about using the products is the ability of the support team to quickly and effectively address issues and even help to configure functionality that may not be available from the main interface. Easily the best chat support experience I have had when there is something technical to accomplish or resolve."
"Literally the best app makers on Shopify, and the best customer support team I have ever encountered. I am someone that never writes reviews, but StarApps went above and beyond my expectations. After giving them feedback about a feature request, they literally coded it over the weekend and I awoke to see the changes implemented. I could not be happier both with the App performing as I hoped, and the Customer Service being top-notch. If I could rate them higher than 5 stars, I would! Do not hesitate if you need a Variant Options or Color Swatches app. They are the best of the best. Great design, and great user experience. What more can you ask for?"
"Excellent customer service, very thorough and knowledgable. The app interface is excellent and simple to use."
"Jedyna aplikacja tutaj, która niezawodnie rozwiązuje problem z integracją Paczkomatów InPost ze sklepem Shopify. Od samego początku działa idealnie. Co ważne dla mnie, nie trzeba umieć kodować, by funkcjonowała bez zarzutu. Wystarczy zainstalować apkę jednym kliknięciem i już :) Proces jest płynny, niezwykle łatwy do zrozumienia i wdrożenia, interfejs bardzo przyjazny dla użytkownika i przejrzysty. Kontakt z deweloperem jest super przyjazny i szybki. Zdecydowanie polecam!
***
The only app that reliably solves the issue with integrating InPost lockers into a Shopify store. It worked perfectly from the start and you don't have to know any coding to get it to work. Just install it with a click and you're done. The process is smooth, extremely easy to understand and implement, the interface very user-friendly and clean. The contact with the developer is super friendly and prompt. Definitely recommended!"
"Très bonne application, je l'utilise depuis ce matin. L'interface est simple et optimisé, je recommande fortement pour one click upsell."
"I enjoy using this app, the employees are quick to help if you need anything and are willing to do small customizations to optimize the user interface."
"WOW! Absolutely incredible app. If you want banner sliders that will blow your customers mind then this is the app for you, and all without any programming. 
I had a few small issues and they fixed them all within a couple of hours, so great support guys. Good support is so important and I cannot rate these guys highly enough.
They have done an incredible job to make the interface so simple to use and understand. I have just built my first animated banner and I cant believe how easy it was. Check it out here https://www.wcsas.com.au"
If I could give 7 stars I would. SUPER friendly and helpful support. Great software interface. very glad I found this product. The best. Thank you!
"Supercart is hands down one of the best cart systems I have ever seen on Shopify. Instantly after turning on I started making money with shipping insurance and donations. Over 70% of my orders are getting upsells. I am currently two weeks in, and supercart has generated me over $7200 extra. Starting off the user interface can be very daunting, but the developers worked around the clock with me because I knew I wanted to implement the features. It is 50000% worth it."
"the integration support is flawless, now it's trying to configure it for our needs but the interface is clean and the integration is dummy-proof."
"The best app to use for automated emails hands down! Their pop up feature is amazing! Their user interface was so easy and very beginner-friendly. The help is amazing and so quick! I have used a couple of other apps, and this is by far my FAVORITE!"
I love this app. It is so user friendly. I use it for my video page: https://monolisadesigns.com/pages/monolisa-product-videos-1 and it creates the perfect video thumbs to match the user interface of my website. A big thanks to the developers who created this.
"Downloaded this app for a while now, but never got around setting it up. Started to toy with it last night, and got into some trouble. However, Nicolas from SmartrMail came to the rescue. Here's what i'm using the app for Automated pop up for discount codes - When visitors visit the site, they are presented with a pop up, the pop up is assigned to a specific list, which triggers an automated workflow. Automated follow up e-mail for clients who have not made a purchase in 90 days. - An automated newsletter is fired when the above rules meets the requirement. Love the level of support, even for a free account. The user interface isn't without it's flaw, it's not perfect, but as a free app, it's pretty good and can get quite a bit done. Would recommend."
I am using the free tier & the app works straight out the box with a easy to use interface. Tieflyclothing.com appreciated & approved.
"This app makes it easy to show customers' add to cart & purchase activity in an engaging way. It has a simple plug & play interface & gives you the ability to choose design, placement & entrance of widget. tieflyclothing.com appreciated & approved!!!"
"About a week into SmartrMail use now and so far, so good! Very easy interface and after coming from a Wordpress site with an external email service, I am loving the integration and overall simplicity. To top it off....GREAT SUPPORT!"
"Good try, but app does not manage desk fees, and always puts ""Free delivery"" option ON on Yalidine interface. So we have to double check every request on Yalidine."
It's very easy to use and the interface is excellent and I'm very happy. It is even better if it supports Japanese.
"Great app that helps me add more important information right at the product page for customers. Fantastic support, helped with a different location within an hour of downloading the app. How support should be. Great user interface too. Recommended!"
"Very cool and easy to use App! Products with longer descriptions can be categorised  and gives a clean overview and nice User Experience to your customers. Our customers are appreciating the new look and feel. We had some questions (about handling with other apps, no bugs :-)) and Robert was very professional, fast answering and solved it. Try it :-) Thanks, Stefan"
"This app is great! It makes the product descriptions so much sleeker and best of all, since we're just starting out, we're taking advantage of the free plan. Originally, our product descriptions were long and scrolling, but now with the accordion, they improve the user experience, creating a more manageable product page. Additionally, customer service is 5-star. I had trouble getting the app installed because of an issue with our theme, and Robert was a great help. He had it fixed within a day, and we started to see our conversion rates climb. Thank you to the team that made this app possible and for great customer service!!"
"Not only the app interface is greatly user friendly, well designed and straight forward, but we had to ask for support from the developer for a better integration, and it was resolved and done within the hour. Great app, great service. Warmly recommends it to anyone looking for the perfect app for tabs."
This app met all of our requirements! Marcello and Steve gave us fantastic support and were able to help us with our customisations. The user-friendly interface makes this app very easy to use and navigate which is a bonus!
"Awesome App period!
I have have tried most other upsell/cross-sell apps. But This app is the best in terms of user experience, performance and pricing.
I am already seeing results, and most importantly support from Marcelo has been great and very prompt as we worked through some of the setup issues. 
You should go ahead and try it out!"
"After trying several (many, actually) Upsell apps, I've chosen this one. Here's why. There are numerous configuration options (settings)--some I would have never thought of. The interface for adding a new Upsell offer is efficient and time-saving. And the best part is...the customer interface is beautiful! It shows an image, an (optional) quantity box, (optional) choices to Continue Shopping, go to the Cart, or even Checkout Now.
Everything seems to have been thought of when this app was being designed. And the online support is superb: friendly, thorough, and (something I've never seen before) they will even send the URL when you need to find some option to work with, so there's no hunting around for it."
Perfect support and app do what it's supposed to. Very easy to use and interface is very user friendly really I loving it.
"This app makes it super simple to add quizzes into your marketing arsenal. There are templates of all types that make it easy to implement and creative examples that serve as inspiration for our own funnel. The best support we've experienced from any Shopify app. Everyone from the Jebbit team was happy to help us get up and running quickly, especially Joe. The interface is user-friendly and takes the guesswork out of most things. As a company, we will be using this tool for everything from lead gen to product development. Worth the install just to try them out."
"Very good app for reviews. A lot of functions. The interface is very friendly. They added a lot of new functions, and it's free. :D"
Fantastic product recommendation - best part is the user friendly design interface so we can can customize what the quiz looks like and integrate it seamlessly into our site. The product integration works like Klaviyo or any other plugin where you can easily pull recommendations in and drive straight to PDP landing pages. Highly recommend.
"Got this App for the simplistic Design, wich pairs with an User-Friendly Interface. 5 Stars for functionality and 5 Stars for one of the fastest and nicest Costumer-Services on this Platform. Very Nice!"
"I signed up for Lead Dyno yesterday and it's my favorite affiliate program I have been able to find so far. The interface is easy to use. Through their super fast responding chat, customer service rep Diedre Stark helped me configure my settings. I wanted affiliates to request approval to be a part of my program. Thanks for the quick response!"
"Great app. It does exactly what we need it to do with an ""easy to use"" interface and easy installation."
"This app allowed us to easily add customisable content to elevate our store, EDMs, SMS and user experience . The support is also top level!
Such a great brand to work with as well, their vision and willingness to listen and action is what sets them apart!"
The Tolstoy widget was so quick to set up with a very friendly user interface. The customer support team is top notch and responds to all my questions within 24 hours and have helped me troubleshoot a variety of situations.
"This application is convenient for users, the interface is easy to use and nice, the support team is enthusiastic. Highly recommend!"
"This is the best app for AOP & DTG printing that exists, & here's why. The quality of the product is exceptional & surpasses competitors. The items are quality, the images represent them with crystalline precision. Second, the design tool offers unparalleled ease & gorgeous aesthetic user interface. Again, it's intuitive + operates seamlessly. This is A+ app development. The synchrony & harmony between the code & the visual + functional design. A breakthrough app that delivers platinum service + product."
"Amazing app! good prices, easy to use. great design interface and the best part they do not charge to design on different parts of the same product like other apps does! some item has the shipping cost a bit high but the quality of the print and the material make it worth! great support team 24h on whatsapp, instagram... I only have good thing to say about this app!"
The design interface is easy to use and they have a great collection of products that are high quality! Their customer service have been very helpful with my questions. I highly recommend adding them to your store!
Easy setup and free ad credits. Great experience so far. User interface is among the best across any sales channel I use. Very excited to see what Pinterest can do for my business.
"I am SO stoked to have discovered and added the Vitals app to my Shopify store for many reasons: its functionality, the depths of its offerings, and the solid & responsive interface to name just a few. Where I'm REALLY blown away is by the customer service. Super fast response times & super fast and effective resolutions. Not to mention that more often than not, they've offered up solutions to problems I didn't even know I had until I had the answer sitting right in front of me. I can't recall the last time I felt such a deep and serious commitment to customer service. So grateful to know they've got my back 100%."
"This app has been an awesome addition to our shop especially during COVID-19 lockdown. Easy to use and customise, and great user experience for our customers. Even better the app develop are super responsive to requests and have answer our emails extremely fast, they have even jumped on and helped us with setup. Super helpful, would totally recommend this app."
We have just set up for a very specific exclusion of a group of products from one country. Interface and process are easy and intuitive. Some nice additional features such as redirects to a custom page. I have tested via a VPN and products are blocked both on the site and even the site search from our chosen country. Support was also top-notch. Great product and thoroughly recommended.
"Terrific feedback, and endless possibilities. I got amazing customer service from Zeus and the whole user experience got much much easier."
"We're using it to run a hidden wholesale program on our regular retail site. Its like having 2 websites on the same domain. You can totally control what your visitor sees, based on whether they are logged in with a tag, or logged in without a tag, or not logged in at all! 
Amazing lockdown app... easy interface... block or unblock anything you want. Top-notch service. Don't think about it, just DO IT! You won't be sorry. :)"
"great application , quick support for our all enquirers ,Highly Recommended,very simple user interface"
"Pros: Well integrated User friendly interface, Logistic intergation is good and smooth processing, the functionality of schedule pickup is very nice
Cons: Pricing is little bit high for new commerce."
"Super impressed with Active Campaign. The tools are so powerful there is very little we can't do. The account management support is really useful as well to help us achieve our goals. We migrated from Mailchimp and were looking for something with a much better interface and behaviour-led automations. Having looked into loads of suppliers, we comfortably chose Active Campaign, and have since recommended it to other businesses. On a basic level it is very powerful, but once you hook into the API it is even better. One negative... no site pop-ups. Bit weird for such a big system, but I have been assured they are coming!"
"I am using shopify to schedule my shopify orders and I can tell you that this is one of the best shipping app available in India.
It has a very simple user interface yet a very powerful system. If you don't want to waste your time........ Install this app.... and start using services."
Fantastic app with client support to match! The app was easy to set up but we needed customisation to match the look of our website @ www.spiffyspools.com. Customer support was responsive over email and went above and beyond over a few rounds of back and forth to give us exactly what we needed. The app works like a charm. Easy intuitive interface and we have already closed a couple of sales since installation.
"From last one year we are using the EZYSLIPS, and this is the best portal to manage your courier services. It has friendly interface which allows you to book the order so easily.
Good, easy and convenient to use. Good service!! very well supportive team."
Awesome support team and great user experience. Helped with all queries almost immediately. App is easy to use.
Thank you Appikon. Easy to use interface and responsive customer support at a reasonable price. I'm a happily satisfied customer!
Junip has been really great for us so far. It is very easy to get setup and running and the interface is very intuitive for us and for our customers to leave reviews.
"Great app for reviews. Clean, customizable interface, and awesome customer support. We've seen huge increase in reviews since installing. Highly recommend"
"Kustomer makes it super easy to see orders from someone who emails or calls us, and even edit/refund/change the orders within the interface so we don't need interrupt our workflow and leave the tool to accomplish something. They're consistently improving it as well."
"Team was super helpful getting us setup, the interface is beautiful and very easy to use. Looking forward to seeing how Junip works for our store!"
"I tried both JudgeMe and YotPo before switching to Junip... Definitely not going back! Junip offers all the features you'd want in a reviews app, with an easy to navigate interface, easy user experience for customers, and much needed integrations (hello Klaviyo). They have very sensible, transparent pricing, and perhaps most importantly A+ support. Whenever I've reached out looking for a feature that didn't yet exist, but they agreed would be valuable, they added it - in a matter of days! Both Stuart and Marcus have been a delight to deal with and I just hope they decide to create more apps next."
I have been using Junip for about a month and love it so far. Being able to request reviews from previous customers was super helpful. The interface is super clean and easy to use. Highly recommend!
"This is an awesome app!  It has a very easy interface so that I was able to quickly set-up a nice little black friday giveaway on my site, glamupgear.com.  I'm getting some nice engagement with it and am hopeful that it will help bring more traffic to my site.  Support is also great!  Got a quick response with a question I had.  Thanks for a great app"
"Absolutely love this app and the customer support is outstanding.  I will say that it takes a bit of time navigating around the interface to figure out where and how to set everything up, but once I did get it all figured out and set up, I was thrilled with result.  
One thing to note is that there is a setting in the initial set up of the sign up form that is worded as ""Offer users to subscribe for more campaigns"" which I misunderstood.  The idea is that if you do check the box for that setting it will make it so that an entrant needs to check a box to explicitly subscribe to your newsletter. Depending on how you view the legal requirements around subscribing you may or may not want that setting.
I also had an additional request which customer support at first told me was unavailable, but once I explained my rationale and the importance for our own customer relationships, the dev team jumped on it and had a solution in place within only a couple days.  Truly outstanding service!  Thanks Akash and team."
I was a bit disappointed about this app - it's not very user friendly considering it's a social app and the overall user interface needs some work.
"Great experience, great tool, great people. Easy onboarding process with knowledgeable reps and easy to use interface.  Will require an HTML skills to update automatic emails, but if you're engaging customers through email already you'll be fine. 5/5, would use again."
"Great app, does what it is supposed to, and although the interface could provide some more helpful ways to manage the data, what's there is simple enough. What's really fantastic is the service and support."
Superb app. Easy to understand interface and allows for in depth manipulation of the data through filters. Creation of a custom report was no trouble for the support chat and their help and input was quick and efficient. Definitely an app to watch as they roll out new features!
"i have tested Better Reports and Report Pudit and neither of them compares with Report Toaster. Hands down much better, the GUI interface is very nice, and the PIE charts are the best, you can not go wrong with it. The support helped me set up my custom reports which are far more superior to Shopify's reports systems. i would give 100 stars if I could, they give me the data/reports that i need to run a biz. thank you!"
"www.taideux.com - Women's Fuller Bust Clothing Store 
This app has taken my website's user experience to the next level! I was able to install a pop up size chart on each product page for FREE. Glad I found it and thanks to the team for providing support in installing the app."
"Really user friendly and makes all the difference in terms of customisation. Great customer service. Super fast, helpful and proffesional. They are there to support and help implement rsther than just sign posting. Well worth the purchase. And actually very easy to use as the instructions afe well laid out and communicated. You can see each step has been considered from the perspective of how a user experiences it, which is not always the case ."
Jeff at Bold Options is very helpful. The support team is skilled at making edits to the Shopify product pages and understands the user experience during checkout. I appreciate their help and love using the app to customize options during checkout.
"Everything is great, with nice templates and an easy-to-use interface. Customer support is fantastic, very helpful."
This is just the gallery app I needed without bait and switching me into a much higher price point. All other gallery apps I have tried gave me a low price only to find out that I am extremely limited on features and or how many photos or galleries I can have. This app does exactly what it says and the price It states gives you access to all features and no limits on how many photos I can have. The interface is simple to use and gives me plenty options to customize my gallery to my liking. It is easy to add my gallery to any page or product I want. I did have a couple questions and the developer responded to me almost immediately. Thank you for the great app and support. We look forward to more apps from you.
It is a good app with plenty of features. The cost quite high but it is the only one that let you rate all the products. There is room for improvements in the user experience
The best in cart upsell app never seen so far. You can reaaly customize everything and the user experience is just perfect. I highly recommand.
"Wow! This is my second purchase from this developer. You can not ask for more than an app with a one-time fee that is completely reasonable. I bought this app because I actually received a ""standard"" order notification from someone I bought from and was surprised at how it made me feel - like the shop wasn't very professional. That got me looking for something like this. The notifications that you can create with this app are really simple and elegant. The interface is super-easy to use to create these beautiful notifications. I probably set the whole thing up in about an hour, and that was only because I was taking my time writing content for each one. If I had a single criticism it's that you have to manually cut and paste in the new notifications into your settings. It couldn't be easier (and the developer has made this process as easy as it can possibly be), but it's tedious). https://thecatisinthebox.com"
"Very impressed. This app helps create professional email notifications, using a similar looking interface as your shopify site. Pros: create professional looking email notifications in no time. Very easy to use interface. Can easily align with look and feel of website. Cons: probably a little bit overpriced. Copying and pasting code for each email is a little bit cumbersome (though I feel they have sought to make this easier with the 'copy' and 'open' buttons)."
"Phew! Perfect! Exactly what I needed! Nice drag-and-drop interface, no mucking with HTML until I want to. Thank you, team! <3"
"The app is perfectly made with a good user interface however there are issues with the outlook app on IOS it cuts the email so the content is not visible entirely. 
10 stars for the support and service this crew gives."
Clean interface that's simple and really easy to use. Price is reasonable unlike a number of others that have capitalised on a captive market. I think you have a customer for life. Please don't change it!
Good App. Does what is says. Its interface is slow sometimes as I am trying to open the notifications and it won't open properly.
"We have been using Bold Product Option App for five years now. Started with Version 1 and have progressed to Version 2. The user interface with version 2 was slightly different but did not take long to get used to it. This version 2 gives us the ability to use swatches and pricing with our Lens Products and the conditional logic is essential. The only draw back has been the cross over with Time Zones causing some reply delays, but many thanks to Nirav and the team for their assistance with quick code installation and responses to questions and formatting.
Great App, Great Team."
"Discount Ninja is pretty much amazing with what it can do with discounts. Pretty much any combination of coupons, automatic discounts, etc. It is doing everything we want it to do anymore. We decided to launch this app one day before BFCM. The support was super slow, but it was the holidays. I get it. Their support is about a 12 hour time difference in the US. So it's back and forth for days sometimes. I was able to book a video meeting with them and address the issues I was having with the app. They made the necessary fixes within a couple of days. They are trying to make the support and user experience great. I'm pleased overall for sure! If you want to use their default settings for all promos, then this software setup is easy. If you're going to start customizing the specifics of each design, it will take some doing. Once you have a ""template"" created for your promos, duplicating them and change a bit of text is relatively easy. They also told me they were working on a templating type of system to make it less work to set up new promos. Overall I give this app five stars. There is nothing else even close for Shopify that does everything this app can do."
I just love it. A wonderful extension to our store which really upgrades user experience. It is a must have for a great store.
We found the app to be very useful in keeping up with our inventory levels well before running out of stock. The interface is very easy to use.
Great FAQ App. Easy to set up and user friendly interface. Very helpful customer service support team.
"This is a great app for FAQs. I like its easy and good-looking operation interface, customized fuctions and the fancy result it gives. It allows you to solve customer doubts in a simple way."
"So far so good - better than Refersion IMO - quick and easy, easier interface. I'd recommend this for your shopify store over the others"
This app is worth its weight in gold! It was exactly what I needed to organize commonly asked questions so that the info did not read like a 30 chapter book. I was able to have FAQ pages for each service I provide. The editor allows me to customize the text and format colors so that the embeded page blends with other pages on my site. Alex quickly responded to my inquiry and resolved my issue in a matter of minutes. FAQify is affordable one of the best apps that give my customers a great user experience.
"Fantastic experience, easy installation, cool interface. I have only tried it for a week now but I couldn't recommend it higher!"
Excellent app! It has all the features that we want for our affiliate program. Interface is very nice and easy to use. Support is also amazing!
"What a fantastic piece of software! I love the interface and the fact that it's so intuitive. Will have to test it a bit more but for starters, I think it's great!"
"Great yser interface, very easy to use and a very extensive free plan to get started. Would reccomend"
"Hello there, While exuding with the power placed at my finger tips, since reviews can really help or compromise a businesses image, I am happy to provide the following review for the Contrado team. So lets start with this, Contrado markets their products as some of the finest to the finest quality, which ever the interpreter wants to interpret, my opinions from the products I have ordered are that they are crafted with the attention to details, reflecting the skills and care placed by their crafters, to provide a beautifully polished finished piece, so well done on quality Contrado. We really like the fact that after an order is placed, Contrado maps out in visual aids, every step the product goes through before getting delivered. Be it the pressing, to the sewing, and even the cutting process, customers simply click on the invoices tab under their orders section, and a window pops up, with what step of the crafting process that specific order is in. Once again, Well done Contrado, this time on orders information fluidity. Now moving forward to their customer service, re-stated this is my opinion, from my experiences, as a store business owner, I like to compare shopping around for a print on demand a lot like, looking for love on a dating app. what I mean by this is, a drop ship will usually promote their best features, it's natural to want to highlight the best qualities, a company offers, however sometimes the rest becomes a discovery after the meet. The Contrado customer service is meh, pretty awesome in my opinion(re-stated). The staff I've had the privilege to converse with, were courteous, if they cannot get to an individual in a timely manner, they offer the e-mailing option from the chat window, and in our case they've had a optimal timely response rate. Well done again Contrado, seems like you're on a roll. As I have mentioned the positives, keeping true to balance and highlighting all aspects within a review, I will leave you with this, the Contrado design interface may take a little getting used to, for us after a little practice we were able to place our designs on the products with ease, there is a server glitch that happens sometimes, where if an individual’s cache isn't cleared some of the products on the Contrado website look a little distorted, but this is only on the their website view, once it has hit our Shopify the images look wonderful. Is it a Contrado mishap, or an individuals personal web mishap, I'd rather not place blame on either and just mention it as an occurrence, so overall Well done, and good luck... Ventignua INC"
"I can honestly say that’s experience with Contrado has been positive since the beginning. I’m a self employed artist/mum and has been a customer with them for a while now . I sampled their products and my customers loved them so when I saw that they offer drop shipping via Shopify, I did not hesitate. At the start it was a bit of a struggle for me finding the time to create designs and trying to work our how to integrate my contrado products into my Shopify account - I almost gave up but the I received an email from Deepa, a member of Contrado’s customer service offering to help. This gave me confidence to give it another try, knowing that there’s someone I can email to answer my questions. I felt really supported by their customer service - they would answer any questions I had and although there wasn’t a perfect solution to my queries - we found a way to make it work. AND I get prompt replies every time. Now my shop is open and I can honestly say I chose the best company to create my products (they are all high quality ) and their website interface is very easy to work with. I just wish I could use my 100 product limit on my Shopify (it’s Shopify’s limitation btw). I’ve placed and initial order just to be sure that the order process would go on smoothly and I am very pleased that it did. I love the products -so reasonably priced for the quality and they have the best customer service I’ve experienced so far."
easy to use and with a lot of functions in one app. our customers are come from all over the world. it would be better if the app with multilanguege interface.
"I really enjoyed this app since early 2019 with no issues until about one month ago when I was unable to check my site speed due to a javascript debugging error. I thought it was another app installed about the same time as when the issue started, but their tech team checked said it was caused by an app called Vault and then sent a copy of the code. I deleted Vault, but the issue still remained. Being concerned about any code left in my back end, I contacted Vault and Anthony assured me that it wasn't their app, but another app. He removed the remaining bits of the Vault code (and I also allowed him to remove the bit of code left over from the 'other app', as I had deleted it weeks previously), and that instantly solved the error so I was very happy all was working fine again. I wanted to give Vault another try so the next day I reinstalled the app and instantly the debugging and javascript error came back, affecting my site speed. I contacted 2 tech experts and after inspecting, asked if I had any app that provided site protection to which I said ""yes"". Both told me that it was an app called Vault, and provided me a copy of the line of code and said this was the cause of the javascript debugging error and that I needed to delete it. I immediately deleted the app and everything is working fine again. Fortunately the code Anthony removed had to be manually added again after reinstallation and I hadn't done that yet. This app worked perfectly for a year without any issues so I assume there must have been changes made recently to cause this issue. I sent an email to Anthony yesterday to update him on what happened, but over 24hrs later I've received no response at all. This app could have caused Google to penalize my site as it causes poor user experience. Many thanks to Shopify for their support in helping me get to the bottom of this issue in helping to reach out to Anthony and hopefully Vault will amend their code to fix this issue."
"If you want to scale, resize etc your images this app is perfect, and it's free for 6000 images per month! Also, the user interface is very clear and easy to use, great job!"
"Really inconsistent. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't - causing me to cancel customer orders. User interface isn't so great. Customer service was responsive but couldn't give an exact cause. I really need the minimum quantity feature so I'm still looking for an app that will actually work."
"Testing it during the free phase I found that the interface was awkward to target a single item and it did not prevent me from adding more than my limit to the basket.
It was not intuitive to use, so I removed it from my apps."
This app is very easy to use. Interface is simple. Functionality is straightforward. Gets the job done as advertised. Support is responsive. Implemented a few changes to my theme to get the app working. Smooth operation.
"This app has an awesome interface you can easily find everything to make new upsells, some of the cleanest upsell setups I've seen around. Not to mention the conversion rate of the upsells themselves easily have 20x ROI from the upsells from the cost of the app. This has become my new favorite app when it comes to using Upsells, I have installed it across several of my stores now. 
Also I cannot forget to mention the chat support is very quick to respond and very helpful, they will quickly answer any question I have and are knowledgable about the app unlike many others I have encountered."
Simply the best app available on this topic. Very cozy and friendly user interface for someone who do not have a knowledge in coding at all
"Very easy interface and great tools to optimize your store with.
Also the customer support is kind and really trying to help!"
Great Interface. Does what it says and easy to use. Customer support is awesome if you ever run into issues!
"In theory this app would be great.  Setup was reasonably easy and the user interface is nice.  However, there are some fundamental flaws that are out of Secomapp's control and are Shopify checkout limitations.  The app uses Javascript in the Google Analytics extra script to try to hide the shipping options during checkout that are not applicable to the customer based on whether they chose Shipping or Pickup in the cart.  But this does not always work and we had many customers somehow choose the local pickup ""free"" shipping option during checkout when they did need it shipped.  We ended up spending so much time fixing these orders and sending additional invoices to collect shipping that it just became not worth it.  We uninstalled the app and now just ask customers to write a note on the cart page saying ""pickup in store"" and we then manually refund the shipping in these cases.  The Secomapp folks are super responsive to technical issues and are very helpful.  We continue to use their store locator app and are very happy with it."
A very useful app that works great. Good for cross and up selling complimentary products without the customer leaving the product they are interested in. Thus enhancing the UX (user experience).
So far I like the interface and easy use of the app. Will see how it effects my sales going forward.
"Don't be fooled by the outdated interface, this app did exactly what I needed it to, and had options I didn't even realise I needed until I saw them. Very easy to use, and a great result."
"This app is an absolute treasure.
I used it in my own store https://printeddream.de to provide my customers a gigantic image gallery as an inspiration pool. 
Cozy Image Gallery's interface looks absolutely clean, the support team is quick with the responses.
If you're looking to encorporate any type of image gallery in your store, look no further!"
"This app saves a ton of time on all things pricing, markdowns, inventory and receiving and has a lot of features that I haven't seen on any other similar apps. I do think the app needs a bit of work on the interface design and language to improve the user experience."
"This company is one of the rare gems who are dedicated. They are so responsive and committed to finding solutions for the most unique queries. I would give them  10 stars if I could, not just for the app, but their entire customer service approach. This app is really great and has made such a difference to our user user experience."
Very expensive for lack of customization options such as having no photo carousel. Ugly and not very intuitive user interface. There are better free options
"It has the best quickview interface and the support is top notch, very customizable which can be further refined with support"
"Great app for what I need. Setup was fast and easy, and interface is very easy to use with a great layout. Works just great for my store."
"First, the app itself is good. It does the job, however be ready to wait, wait, wait :) You have to wait to save, then you have to wait to activate. As user interface is not super friendly, ...hummm...you are going to make mistakes at the beginning. So you have to wait to deactivate, then you can adjust the settings, then you wait to save, then you wait to activate. Very unusual for a shopify app (I am using more then 80 apps and it is a first).They need to fix that or at leats excplain why. If you compare to PRE-ORDER NOW, this app is below in term of features and speed for a similar price. Price. Real price is $29.90 if you want full support and not $19,90 as mention on the app page. On top of that support is reactive but limited. I know app dev do not have to perform extra such as customising buttons but, guys, when you upload a new app on the store you must build your reputation and do some extra to gain trust and loyalty of your clients. On top of that, they implement their own button so it should be part of the package to make sure their 'vison' match their clients' 'vision'. In my case, I am an early adopter of the app so have it 'free for life'. Yeah, free but even I helped to debug the app months ago, they make me feel that I am no paying = 'check the FAQ and sorry we cannot help you to adjust the design of your button to match your theme'. I assume it is because I am not paying, at least I hope, because PREORDER NOW adjusted the button on my other websites. Fair enough but let's be clear : I NEVER ASKED to have the app for free for life and they should have warned that support will be limited. A shame because we have 5 shopify stores, all offering pre orders but the value of this app and support, at this stage, does not motivate me to replace PRE ORDER NOW. I do not want to take the risk and then face multiple 'sorry we cannot help you'. I am still putting 4 stars as the app is good and I do not want to undermine their work (it is more a 3 stars), but the support is limited so I cannot really recommended it as I do not know if they will help you if you pay $29.90/month (a shame in that case). I think it is mostly a lack of commercial strategy but...at this stage it is at 200 miles in term of support of apps such as Judge.me and Vital who understood the importance of managing the implementation from scratch to lock the clients to make sure everything is working fine from day one. Conclusion for the dev : 5 min of extra work, and an offer aligned with your direct competitors, can help you to gain more clients very quickly. An immediate NO...leads to stagnation."
"One year in, and I STILL HATE this POS. Clunky and hard to navigate through those stupid tiles, and no updates to the design at all. UPDATE: This is still a horribly designed POS system. The user experience clearly was not tested in the real world. And now they have changed the inventory management to be even worse. Of course you can always pay them more money to get some of those old very basic features back. SCAM This app used to be great. The new update is TERRIBLE!!! The ""lite"" version is missing basic every day functions- cant do exchanges anymore, employees cant log in, and they lay out is just bad and confusing. All this is here for now is to squeeze and extra $80 out of you. Real shame. Looking into alternatives to shopify now. Update: Months later and ZERO improvements have been made. Still horrible. Shopify is still ignoring all the negative feedback they are getting. More 1 star reviews than 5 and 4 star reviews combined, haha. Wake up!"
Codisto's customer service is incredible. Using the chat box is extremely quick and easy. They really want to get your problem solved and will take as long as they need to to help complete whatever it is you're trying to get done. The app itself has an easy-to-use interface and the developers are continuously working to improve the program even further.
The user experience is simple and straight forward. Amazing customer service team will recommend!!!!
"My sales are already going up since I started using this app. It's very light, easy to use and it has a very clean/modern user interface that I was looking for. It also has great support from the devs. I hope to see even more updates in the future. Love this app!"
"This app is amazing. It has a very good user interface and all the required additional pages like FAQs, Contact Us, Track Your Order pages. Highly Recommended!"
"Great app, easy installation and intuitive interface! Can set many custom service operators with Whatsapp or Facebook Messengers for free!
Absolutely recommended!"
App is perfect! Works well. No issues. Easy interface. We tested the codes on our products and everything was fine. Exporting codes worked and was easy to do. Modifying the discount is easy as well. 5/5
"Support only available business hours (California time) M-F. As a small business I am often updating inventory after hours and on weekends. So, not ideal. Generally a good product, easy to use and understand. Our biggest issue is the lack of error checking on imports. If Sellbrite doesn't find a matching sku, it skips that row and doesn't import it. But it doesn't TELL you that it skipped more or one rows, only gives a generic 'your import completed successfully' (even if it didn't import everything). So we would have to manually verify each item after import to make sure it actually changed the inventory numbers. Not very scaleable or trustworthy. Tool requires separate imports to create a product and to add or change inventory (can't do it in one step like Shopify does). It also requires separate imports and exports for each warehouse/location. Not a dealbreaker, but annoying, and may result in mistakes by the user. I like the audit trail to show the history of changes made to each product. I liked the easy product creation from the Shopify store into Sellbrite for the first time. The interface is fairly easy to navigate, but they don't have a mobile-friendly website (and no app), so can't really use the tool on a phone or tablet, you have to be using a PC all the time. The reporting is EXTREMELY limited and doesn't allow for a simple comparison of inventory between/across warehouses - you have to export each one yourself and do the comparison. Sellbrite might be a good tool if you have limited products and simply want the ability to sell in multiple channels. But we won't continue with the service until/unless they provide error messaging in imports, and would like to see more reporting options."
"Excellent service and cloud-based program.  Since I switched to Sellbrite last year, my inventory has been much more organized with fewer errors.  The interface of Sellbrite is simple, the help from their customer service second to none.  I sell through Amazon, Walmart, and Shopify and this has kept my inventory perfect across the board and allowed me to keep one stock for all 3 channels.  Can't recommend more highly!  
Also the transition and learning curve were very easy,I was up and running in an hour at most."
Awesome app. Helped to create 500 codes in less than a minute. The interface is simple and easy to use. Recommended!
Recently moved to SellBrite and so far have been very pleased. Nice user interface and very responsive customer service.
"I have been using this app for about 2 months. The developers are very helpful and answer all questions in depth and quickly! The interface with Ebay could not be easier, I am very pleased with the speed and ease of listing new products to Ebay! Now, I am just waiting for the ability to list unique products to Amazon, which I have been told they are working on! This is a great product, do try it for yourself!"
"I've been with Sellbrite since December 2012 and I echo other reviewers' sentiments.
1. The software - GUI is clean, layout is intuitive, interface is snappy and it ""works"" as expected. These aspects allow me to be more efficient and focus on growing my business. Sellbrite's slogan of ""simplified multi-channel selling"" is spot on.
2. The support - If something doesn't work, contact the Sellbrite team and they will investigate. You'll receive a helpful response typically within 24 hours. I've submitted several feature requests and they've been integrated into the software. These factors make me feel like a valued Sellbrite customer.
3. The price - The old adage ""You get what you pay for"" doesn't apply here. I was never fond of the other guys' revenue sharing price models. With Sellbrite, I know exactly how much I'm paying each month. I don't have another party siphoning off cash linearly with revenue while I'm growing my business. This allows me to continually reinvest more cash in my business than if I used the revenue sharing companies. In fact, my sales are up 70% from last year thanks to Sellbrite."
"This is an all around great app from an all around great company. 
The user interface is the friendliest in the market, and the time saved is invaluable. 
To top it off, I have never dealt with such a responsive and friendly support team with any software I have ever used. 
Thank you Sellbrite"
I like this app - it generates unique discount codes very efficiently. Interface is super easy to use. Excellent
"Shopify- what can I not say about it! There are many features that I have just loved since its launch.  I love the clean, bright, user-friendly interface; the happy-to-help, knowledgeable staff; the ease of importing and exporting products to multi-channel selling platforms, such as Amazon, ebay, and Etsy and the affordability. But above all what I love most about Sellbrite, is that my business is growing right along with them. I totally recommend Sellbrite. If you are wanting to expand your exsiting ecommerce business to the next level, give them a call. When you do give them a call, you may even encounter one of the founders answering a customer service call. Don't be shy, be amazed! Signed~ Truly Blessed!"
"Awesome app, so simple and fast to use. Creates codes quickly and a really easy to use interface. Already one of our favourites."
it basically earns you free money. very clean user experience and their team has the best support of any shopify app i've ever used.
FIRST THING....I researched several of the other apps on youtube. I was annoyed and frustrated at the way things were laid out in terms of pricing and workflow and user experience. The thing that made this app the right app for my business is the NATIVE post purchase shopping cart. This means that AFTER a person makes their purchase you can offer them something else to buy (since they are already in a buying mood) and they DO NOT have to re-enter payment info. Plus I use shopify payments; other apps required that I add an outside payment system. Zipify uses the payment info that is already in shopify. SECOND THING I really like about this app. It's super easy to do. Super easy to set up and use. I was all prepared for a long and hard learning curve getting this thing set up on my site. I was totally wrong. I got it up and running right (making what they call funnels) in about an hour or so on 4 different products. They have a few small minor bugs but overall this thing ROCKS. Great little piece of software for a non programmer. LAST THING This app does not cost that much. The other apps are outrageous! This company only wants a little of your money for A LOT of help that they provide. They make money when you make money. I was sold once I saw the pricing model. The other apps were just terrible in this area. Some of them wanted to charge you for just showing the up sale option to the customer. These guys have a base monthly of 25 bucks or something no matter how many people see the up sell. You pay them based on what you brought in. I'm happy.
"We’ve been using this app with great success. Have tried other pre and post purchase applications, but OCU is hands down the best one we’ve come across in terms of flexibility, ease of use and how intuitive the interface is. Love how it is now seamlessly integrated with the Shopify checkout. This app just keeps getting better! Thanks Zipify team!"
"TradeGecko is by far the most effective way of operating multiple online stores in different regions and/or on different platforms while accurately and efficiently maintaining product inventory across all channels. The B2B eCommerce portal adds the incredible capability of offering your business / wholesale customers an online ordering platform that can operate alongside your retail online store.  This solution is a little more pricey than some of its competitors, but it is well worth the additional cost.  They have amazing customer service and the interface is highly intuitive and efficient for any store administrator to use."
"I strongly recommend ShippingEasy. The app interface is super user-friendly and very straightforward. What even better is the support teams, they get back to any question I have really fast. A solid 5 star app."
"Great program to manage our inventory and orders. Specifically designed for wholesale business. Supports multiple currencies which is feature we need as we we supply bikes in Canada and USA. Intuitive interface and easy to integrate multiple Shopify stores. Support team quickly responds to support inquiries. Fair pricing for what you get. 
Pros: Integrates with e-commerce and accounting add ons. Manage inventory, Purchase orders, and customer orders. Purpose-built for wholesale businesses. Supports multiple currencies and warehouse locations. Includes B2B portal
Cons: Had a few issues with certain data not syncing properly. (Support team was quick to solve) Reporting functions could be improved to allow more customized reports."
"I have been using this app for 1.5 years and have only had a few small issues.  Customer service support chat is helpful, efficient, and  responds quickly. A good interface with Shopify. Overall, a great choice for our medium sized business shipping needs."
"This application has helped me a lot, the interface is also easy to use and manage. Especially, I can link to other sites very conveniently and quickly"
"Developers of Tradegecko run their own business out of which Tradegecko was born. This means Tradegecko solves real world needs and delivers!
It integrates beautifully with Shopify and the Xero accounting package + other apps - but these two I am familiar with - and actually recommend.
So for instance as soon as a sale is marked as shipped (ie fulfilled) - inventory state is automatically reflected on the Shopify website as well - giving a true picture of the inventory state at any given moment.
Tradegecko is built on the outstanding Ruby-on-Rails web framework - same as Shopify. There are undelying technical reasons explaing this framework's great capabilities... For example, the Ryby language being a TRULY Object Oriented stand alone language on its own - something that the competing php 'lang' web frameworks CANNOT match. The php 'lang' Object Orientation was bolted on later in the php 'lang' development as something of an afterthought.
In short the external app integrations with Shopify and Xero are done properly and work really well. Couple this with a very very good User Interface inside Tradegecko - a pleasure to use...
If you are a large multinational - you already have a custom inhouse solution.
If you manufacture involved products (ie use complex bills of materials), Tradegecko might not be your best match (not yet).
BUT for most other start-ups/small/medium businesses out there - the majority - Tradegecko should be a beautiful fit. Very highly recommended.
Thus,
Tradegecko functions very, very well for its intended target audience of small/medium size businesses.
Have been using it for over a year and have nothing but praise.
The integration with Shopify and Xero - what I primarily use are outstanding.
The only reservation, already mentioned is this:
If you are serious manufacturer with a complex composite bill of materials (BOM)
making up each product - perhaps in its current state Tradegecko is not the best match.
But for the rest ie. a large number of typical small/medium size businesses it is a GREAT match.
Looking to the future:
-----------------------------
We have seen an increase in use of a database paradigm known as NoSQL -
you have heard the names: eg Memcached, Redis, MongoDB, Cassandra, Berkley, couchDB etc etc.
While they are great as caching technology, many software as a service (SAAS) providers make a mistake of treating NoSQL as their ONLY database solution.
Thankfully, I have been informed by Bradley Cameron (Tradegecko's CTO) that Tradegecko continues to use a traditional relational database - PostgreSQL in this case - full marks there for not running away with the NoSQL hype.
As for the future, the fast speed NoSQL caching technology may have its place - used for caching (combined with the relational database in the background).
If you are a growing medium size business consider the following...
The rise of noSQL - picking through the hype
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Many NoSQL databases are designed to run well on large clusters - so it has a lot to do with large corporation's conveniences - hence the hype.
For example Google is running distributed server-clusters presenting a front of a 'single box'...
But it is NOT an actual single server and running traditional relational SQL databases in a massively distributed fashion started to present problems for the big corps - not us.
Still, this is what makes the noSQL more attractive for large data volumes of the big corps.
Hence the hype and push for noSQL.
Horses for courses:
---------------------------
A long standing and well respected computer scientist - Martin Fowler,
(his latest book: 'Introduction to NoSQL') emphasizes that NoSQL databases are NOT going to
replace relational databases - your PostgreSQL or MySQL etc - no need to be taken in by the hype.
A business example:
------------------------------
Consider an actual real world example (the 'Diaspora' social network, below) where the choice of database type almost derailed a business:
http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/
Here is a short extract...
""What is cache invalidation, and why is it so hard?
Cache invalidation is just knowing when a piece of your cached data is out of date, and needs to be updated or replaced.
Here’s a typical example that I see every day in web applications. We have a backing store, typically PostgreSQL or MySQL,
and then in front of that we have a caching layer, typically Memcached or Redis
(or other noSQL type solutions - MongoDB, Cassandra, Berkley and couchDB etc).
Requests to read a user’s activity stream go to the cache rather than the database directly, which makes them very fast...
BUT
What happens if a background job fails partway through? Machines get rebooted, network cables get unplugged, applications restart. Instability is the only constant in our line of work. When that happens, you’ll end up with invalid data in your cache. Some copies of the post will have the old title, and some copies will have the new title. That’s a hard problem, but with a cache, there’s always the nuclear option.
You can always delete the entire activity stream record out of your cache and regenerate it from your consistent backing store. It may be slow, but at least it’s possible.
What if there is no backing store? What if you skip step 1? What if the cache (the noSQL solution) is ALL you have?
When MongoDB is all you have, it’s a cache with no backing store behind it. It will become inconsistent. Not eventually consistent — just plain, flat-out inconsistent, for all time. At that point, you have no options. Not even a nuclear one. You have no way to regenerate the data in a consistent state.
When Diaspora decided to store social data in MongoDB, we were conflating a database with a cache. Databases and caches are very different things. They have very different ideas about permanence, transience, duplication, references, data integrity, and speed.
The Conversion
Once we figured out that we had accidentally chosen a cache for our database, what did we do about it?
Well, that’s the million dollar question. But I’ve already answered the billion-dollar question. In this post I’ve talked about how we used MongoDB vs. how it was designed to be used. I’ve talked about it as though all that information were obvious, and the Diaspora team just failed to research adequately before choosing.
But this stuff wasn’t obvious at all. The MongoDB docs tell you what it’s good at, without emphasizing what it’s not good at. That’s natural. All projects do that. But as a result, it took us about six months, a lot of user complaints, and a lot of investigation to figure out that we were using MongoDB the wrong way.
There was nothing to do but take the data out of MongoDB and move it to a relational store, dealing as best we could with the inconsistent data we uncovered along the way. The data conversion itself — export from MongoDB, import to MySQL — was straightforward..."""
"Our store has been using CustomCat for almost 4 years and we are big fans! Their team is constantly looking for ways to improve the interface and usability of the app. Their products are good balance of price/quality and they stand behind them with a fair replacement policy for defective items. Their production times are very reasonable as well. Of course no POD is 100% perfect, but I think CustomCat does a stellar job with customer service, even during peak holiday times. Their seller Facebook page is an invaluable resource for sellers to navigate stock availability, learn design best practices and communicate with other sellers/CustomCat staff."
Tradegecko is absolutely amazing. I've been looking for a long time for an app that would work with our online store and also our wholesale business. Something that we can use to easily track wholesale orders but integrate with out Shopify store and will give us up to date information on sales and stock levels. Tradegecko works perfectly with both and is so easy to use but still has all the functionalities needed for a more complex business. The other great thing is the support we get from the team. Whenever in doubt or have any issues there are always here to help and provide a solution to suit our business. The user interface is very easy to use and to understand. I would really recommend giving it a try!!
This platform has been able to support our growing business wonderfully. Whenever I need anything their customer service has been so helpful. I would recommend. I enjoy the easy interface and the ability to make labels so quickly when we need them.
"If you want to have an app for your Shopify store, then I highly recommend this app, it has a user-friendly interface, is very easy to use, and the most important thing is the Mowico team, they are very customer-centric, supportive, and smart."
"Perfect for what it does, highly recommend it. Easy to use interface of the app with a good variety of placement options."
It works really well. I like how you can adjust the colour and how it changes when you click it. Brings it right back up to the top of the page where you can click on the cart which can be helpful for shoppers. I think it’ll help with user experience and convenience.
A great tool to build a mobile app without IT people. The interface is very easy. We plan to add custom features for my store with the support of their Customer Support team.
"I had to go through 4 apps before I found Quantity Price Breaks, which made volume discounts easy and robust. You can change all the language in the app interface around the Discounts and apply discounts for 2 or more which is very useful- other apps i tried wanted me to input pricing for 3,4,5 etc, which did not work for our scenario. 
So the app works great, and the support was excellent, I had some questions and needed help because all those other apps I had installed had changed the code. Omega was quick and very helpful, I even contacted them again when I thought I had a problem and it turned out I didn't, but they were super friendly and helpful even then. Highly recommend the app."
"Hi
Very good quality in the description of a product that I requested and the interface of the application has a very good design and is friendly. I recommend it 100%"
"Very smooth app, with a nice interface, was in need of some help got help within 5 minutes. Does its job 100%"
Shivalikadev from CED commerce is providing and outstanding customer service. Literally I have never experienced such a prompt and helpful customer service. Helped me all the way with category mapping and even did that for me so I can invest my time elsewhere. Greatly recommended not just for customer service but for user interface and all the app is just very helpful and great.
"I must say, CedCommerce customer support is absolutely amazing (specially James, Hello James, ""waving emoji""!!). I have been using the app since its beta version and you can see that they are improving and adding more features. At first the interface can be a bit daunting but after a few minutes you can get the grip of it. The best part is that it is all automated and no need to use Fruugos back office. The second best part is that unlike most other channels around Shopify, you do not need to have your store in USD and can be based around the world. I do recommend the app. Regards, S"
"Taking into consideration that e-commerce is an ever expanding niche, apps like Trust help my site stand out form the crowd with a clear, colorful set of badges that let the customer know they can shop here with confidence. Easy to use interface with many options."
DO NOT LISTEN to the people that are upset about them creating a 100% discount code - they do that ONLY to push through a single ONE TIME test order.  It's a one time code and just used to test tracking.  If you don't want them to HELP YOU verify that the app is working you can always push through your own test order.  This is a great app that I have used across 3 different brands.  Great support and it has a simple and easy to use user interface.  On our oldest brand I've used Refersion for 2 years and processed hundreds of thousands of dollars through them and always been very happy with the service that they provide.
"Easy to set up, user-friendly interface, and Ty was very responsive and helpful. Super cool, both Ty and the app! :)"
"Andre was top notch! Some apps drag their feet to install their code to your site but this went swiftly! 
Hope to add additional positive customer service & user experience reviews in the future."
"Great user interface, customer service. They take feedback on really well and the app has improved over the months!! Nice work team."
"Great app! Easy to use. I really like the user interface!
Most impressive part has been the customer service! Emma was always on top of it, responded quickly and helped on small and large initiatives.
The only thing that they could do better is allow stores to actively recruit on the platform. Hope there are plans for that!"
The interface is easy to use which makes pricing a cinch. Inventory Source has a great selection of product suppliers.
This app has some really great features and user experience is awesome. The upsell features and free shipping nudges are such a great add on for our customer experience and rewards making it so easy for them to make decisions. Customer service is on top of it in case you have questions as well.
"Very helpful customer service - pretty much an instant response. Haven't deployed the app fully yet, but the interface is nice and easy to use."
"We had some issues but support is very responsive and the app itself is quite flexible and performs really well. The interface is also easy to work with. Tested several apps, so far it is the best one."
"The interface is well made. Easy to set and to customize. The developpers have tought a lot about the UI and UX. What I appreciate best is their support, top notch. The app still need to improve many aspects on the upsell parts to fit most case scenarios but for our use, it is beyond expected. The dev team said they are working on their roadmap to add more features and the team seem open to more customization."
"I originally reserved my review until I was able to understand all of their features, use the ones I needed, and experience their customer support so I could offer a well-informed review. Well, I must say that Inventory Source has exceeded my expectations!
You see I'm all about efficiency and the more time I save doing tedious tasks, the more I can devote towards other aspects of establishing my brand. They offer a host of robust features and customization options that I didn't fully appreciate until I found I could use them to save me hours of ""manual labor"" keeping my survival kit website updated. I swear by their automation services to keep my inventory up-to-date, especially with multiple vendors, which is a huge time-saver since I don't have to rely on vendor emails/update lists and frequent checks to the vendor websites to see if any products are out of stock, new ones added, or prices have changed. I've also grown to appreciate their price control tool and all of its options, which kept me from having to go into every single product and manually adjust base vendor prices (flat amount or percentage markups/discounts, MAP based pricing, minimum/maximum prices...just to name a few). Can you imagine how long that would take if your site had hundreds, or a few thousand SKUs? 
By choice, my own customer support questions have always been via email, and the answers to my questions were always courteous and prompt (usually withing a few hours unless I submitted it in the middle of the night). So no problems there. I've also noticed that they've introduced a brand new interface for the back-end of their site which is MUCH more user-friendly than what they had before.
Overall, very deserving of a 5-Star rating."
"MonsterUpsells has been a game changer for our store! We saw increased AOV within days of installing the app, so it literally paid for itself in the first couple of orders. We had tried a few post-purchase upsell apps in the past and just weren't 100% happy with the user experience. With Monster, I was immediately drawn to the fact that the upsells are displayed inside the cart drawer (thereby skipping Shopify's boring cart page & getting our customers to the checkout faster). The app is also really easy to set up, with great design features & thoughtful touches like emojis, progress bars & even animated confetti! Absolutely love it."
"Simple and easy! I do reccomend it, very organized and beautiful interface. It definitely worked well for my small business."
I'm starting to use the app and everything looks good at the moment. The interface is very user friendly and the costumer service is A+. Lance was very helpful.
"So far so good. Have not had enough time to really have a play with, but easy to navigate and understand. Interface is also very pleasing compared to other apps on the market."
Great app made for beginners as well as experts makes online ecommerce easy. Started out lost after the tutorial videos had the process down packed. very simple interface as well as sync options and process.
"Great app! Just what we needed. The interface / dashboard is simple and easy to use for both the back end and for the customers. The app allows simple and more complex customizations to suit your products/services. Installation was a breeze. Technical support was top-notch and fast. Overall, we recommend this app."
"Does what it says on the tin and calculates shipping based on cart's content and customer's geo-location. Significantly reduced the amount of enquires we received about how much shipping would be on International orders (a lot of people just don't want to go as far as checkout to find out), so saves us time and reduces clicks for customers which is always a good thing. Not easy to say with certainty whether it has increased conversion, but it certainly improves user experience."
User friendly interface & excellent customer service. Totally have a great customer experience. Really love this app!
This app works great and easy to learn user interface. It's also great to be able to manage multiple widgets from a single dashboard. Keep up the great work guys.
"The very first thing that came to my mind when I heard the word ""sidemonkey"" was ""monkey see, monkey do."" It was something out of a 1930s New York gansta movie in which the old boss teaches a lesson to his subordinates. Cool name, by the way. Font integration is smooth. HTML Fonts and special Apple emojis are supported. Multiple colors give artists space to select the desired theme. Great user experience in general. Excellent for generating attention oriented sales and page retention rates. Please keep it up. Warm regards from Cambodia."
"More and more shoppers are using mobile devices to shop. And having this app installed should make a HUGE difference in our stats and user experience. It not only is a FUN way to shop, but a FAST way to shop! And since customer can leave your site quickly, it's important to engage them quickly! This app does just that...engages the customer into exploring your products and swiping left or right or down to add to cart! WOW...I was having so much fun testing it on our site that I didn't want to stop swiping! LoL
I can't wait to see the stats that they provide. I will certainly share them here with an update. Also, their customer services is absolutely THE BEST! My agent even offered to make a custom product image with our item and the swipe left, swipe right icons so I could include it in an email to our customers! The onboarding process is smooth, quick and easy. Had it installed, customized and running in minutes. You cannot go wrong with this app. Get it now, orr lose sales...your choice."
"We downloaded the app and were using it in our shop - nanoclear - the set up looks nice, and very easy to configure. our customers user experience is much better in mobile now! plus - they add more products to cart, since we started using the app! thanks guys!"
It is great app and very helpful. the interface is very simple and user friendly. Thank you so much.
"Fast customer service, smooth layout and interface with many customisable options, highly recommendable."
"This is a great app. It quickly creates a mobile friendly interface, syncing all your products.  The customer service is great and they respond quickly too.  I would only wish that their first phase of membership was a little cheaper per month."
"Review update: The support replied to my initial review, and hopefully they will implement the suggested points.
__________________________________
Initial review: I tested the app so this is what I think:
1. I can't add a photo gallery or choose any consecutive images e.g. 2nd, 5th as I have multiple in the listing that I want to publish.
2. Limited to two social accounts only FB and Twitter. There are plenty of others that should be on the list, at least 5 to 10 most popular.
3. There is no URL shortener available e.g. bitly.com, so I can't link to my shortener account to either uses generic Bitly or custom domain shortener links, because original link display looks impractical as it is too lengthy. If you do happen to hook-up Bitly, then make sure you have the feature to customise shortened URL within the same App interface, not to jump between windows for a custom URL and then get back and re-paste manually again.
4. I guess, no engagement metric, nothing. No CTR, efficiency measures, reach views.
Hope you to improve it, thank you."
"This app is filling so many gaps in the gift card space for us – sending to recipient, scheduling the send to recipient (i.e. TRUE gifting), minimizing winback strategy for sold out items with the option to buy a gift card instead. The interface is clean and user-friendly so it's ideal for shops with any level of dev support to implement and use effectively."
"We've been using Recommendify for our webstore for several years on Shopify, and have found it to be helpful for promoting product recommendations and simple to use with their interface. Their support has always been quick to reply to any questions we've had and in resolving any issues that have come up for our shop over the years. Would definitely recommend(ify) trying this app if you're looking for something consistent and reliable for cross-selling/up-selling to boost visibility and sales on Shopify."
"Easy to install, very slick interface - and most importantly: excellent customer support."
Very easy to install and to use with a nice mobile interface. No complaints
"The old shoppad app was not very good, barely any description of product, poor barely-there homepage etc.... this new one looks much flashier and more app-like and all that. BUT BEWARE.
We installed this app and over a period of a few days it was clearly obvious it was a fail. Our bounce rate for mobile and tablets doubled. Our pages per visit slashed from ~9 to ~3. This had a serious effect on our actual sales placed on mobile/tablet, as well as affecting traffic ending up on desktop. We had some of our worst performing days while the app was active, with seriously lower sales and conversion rate, so we have removed it.
Our website uses instead a responsive theme with some changes made to mobile, but mostly a desktop website for tablets. Our mobile experience is sort of okay but not that good, it needs a lot of work, and yet it performed twice as good (or more) than this app.
So I say beware of the claims and the marketing. It may be better than NO mobile website, but it may also perform worse than a well optimized responsive site. The user interface is a bit sluggish and not really intuitive... the whole thing of turning pages is I think far too removed from normal shopping experience that I didn't even realize that I could do that, or how to get to the products... the usability is poor with too much learning curve. Also the app lacks really useful marketing, sales, various other ecommerce features like cross-sells, up-sells etc... all the cool stuff you can do with OTHER apps and plugins, that have absolutely no effect when using this app. I recommend getting your responsive website put in place well so that you can benefit from all the other things an ecommerce store really needs, which this app does not provide.
I'm giving it 3 stars for `looking nice` and `being original` but nothing more, due to the proof that it performs badly and is unintuitive."
"I cannot stress my five star rating enough: 
- Excellent job understanding and automating product relationships
- Easy to use back-end interface (from installing to day-to-day management)
- Top notch customer service and tech. support
- Great styling across all devices
This is a very well thought out and effective application all the way around!"
"After a lot of comparison with other Mobile-App building apps, I finally chose Shopney for its beautiful designs and smooth interface. The support team is friendly and always available. Got the apps listed on Apple and Google in less than a week. Kudos."
"Wide range of products, excellent prices and great user experience. I really recommend either for starting e-commerce brand or established brand that want to expand product portfolio."
"This is my go-to supplier for my stores. Product selection grows daily, integration and product upload are seamless, and the prices allow me to be competitive while offering quality products delivered quickly. Customer service is great with immediate responses to any questions or support I’ve needed. The interface is very intuitive and the help videos and FAQ are clear and concise. Highly recommend you partner with them and they will be my source on any future stores."
"Firstly I would like to say thank you to Lara and Yasmin for their amazing assistance and customer service, from the simplest questions to more complex areas. Secondly, we find Shopney very easy to use, the user interface is great! Lastly, Shopney fits in perfectly with our business theme and look. Thanks Shopney, keep up the good work!"
"It's amazing.
A brilliant interface,
knowledgable articles,
especially quick & friendly customer service!:)"
"Great App, does not slow down site, and a nice interface, it does work really well to save stories and friendly support!!!"
"The interface was very easy to use, the popups works perfectly, and the customer service was wonderful!"
"With all due respect to other leading mobile app makers on shopify, Shopney feels extremely premium, very easy to use, very professional and run by extremely kind people. The interface, customisation, support and the overall feel of the app created on Shopney have that high end, premium feel. Definitely recommended."
"I studied so many app in the shopify AppStore, and even tried some paid app to compare, and I found the shopney. App is the greatest app and they have so good customer service. After use about 10months, I found they had trying to to upgrading the app functional and integration frequently! As the 6years+ shopify user experience, I can recommend this app to whom may concern!

"Co-op is awesome. Their app is an incredibly helpful tool for cross-sell and up-sell. It fits right into our overall user experience without being intrusive at all. On top of all that, their customer service is top notch."
"Finally, a Shopify app that values best-in-class UI and design. I’ve been waiting for something that adequately speaks to our brand positioning and aesthetic. The user interface is beautiful and seamless, it just feels so good to use. It really shows co-op’s attention to detail and acts as a reflection of the amazing brands that are on the platform. In addition to the beautiful user experience, we’ve been able to tap into an entirely new channel to acquire customers and reach our desired segments. On top of that, we have access to upsell, survey tools to drive real measurable incremental revenue. Great app!"
"So I installed the app just over a week ago and have been able to set everything up and see how analytics rolls in. I can say that I absolutely love the user interface/admin. It's clean and so well designed. I had a few hiccups getting everything properly installed on my site (possibly due to another app that has a popup @ checkout for friend referrals) and the co-op team was super helpful and quick to get it resolved. I also had a hiccup on how pricing was imported into the app and they fixed that quickly for me, too. (customer service/support has been top notch) I love how you are able to define the partners/brands you want to work with so no direct competitors show up on your ""thank you"" page and I REALLY love how you are able to customize/over-ride the product images imported from shopify to show lifestyle images and/or gifs. I have started to see data roll into the analytics and while I have not had any conversions yet, I love how I am able to see the click-through rate for each specific product. (WOW, one of my products is a clear winner there) I went ahead and opted to buy some impressions to get the ball rolling so I am excited to see how that turns out (still too soon to say cause the added impressions didn't start firing off until yesterday) All in all, I LOVE the idea of this app and am super stoked to see how the next few months go. I am currently only utilizing the cross-sell and up-sell features and may test the offers and survey later. My one and only hesitation atm is that the app *may* be negatively affecting my site speed score. My speed score dropped a bit around the same time I installed the app and I have my developer looking into it. (ALL apps will affect site speed, tho, this is not unique to co-op) ... I just wanted to be as thorough and honest with the review as possible. From the naked eye, just surfing the site, it doesn't feel any slower - it's just the speed score rating that caught my attention. Thanks so much for creating such a dope app to help smaller brands cross-promote with one another! With all the iOS privacy updates, I feel like your timing was perfect."
The app have very good user interface and work well. There is nice support and help you setting up the app as what you need. I strongly recommend the app.
We are very satisfied with this service. It contributes to the success of our Customized Golf Balls Online store. The interface is really simple and the team always helps us out ! Thank you very much.
"This app has potential with its nice user experience but is still in need of some significant feature upgrades for the price point it is in. SVG file export, SVG colorization, control of the available fonts without having to email support to name a few. I look forward to what they release in the future and will re-evaluate my review."
"App is working like a champ.  Very simple interface and very powerful reporting.  Support is first rate with very fast response time for any questions to date.  Highly recommend this for your profit/loss reporting.

"This is must have app for Shopify. We spent time looking at various solutions for this from quickbooks to other accounting solutions. They all required a ton of time to upkeep and the reports didn't wind up being what we needed. This is a simple interface, easy to up keep and gives you the valuable data you need to make most business decisions. Want to know what your most profitable vendors or items are? Look no further. Combine this with a easy one click set up and EXCEPTIONAL and RESPONSIVE support, I struggle to understand how anyone wouldn't find the money for this app. If you want good margin/ profit data to help you make informed business decisions; set it up today.....unless you are a Mid Century Modern & custom Furniture store. Then you don't need it. Go back to what you were doing. Nothing to see here."
"App is incredibly easy to use. Managed to drop in my costs in under 10 minutes (manually). Interface is intuitive. No need for reading help docs just click and discover really. 
Price is perfect. Please don't increase!"
Used the app to schedule sales meetings with clients. They have been very adaptive to our needs and continue to develop the app further for more customization and a better user experience.
"This is a great app for the price. It offers most of the features you will need and the interface is friendly and intuitive. And there are NO profit-eating fees for every subscription you sell. I'm having a bit of an issue with the lack of admin notification setting in my Platinum plan, but my service rep Gigi, and tech expert, Xu Tho, are working to resolve it quickly."
"All we can say in one line ""It's a life-saving app"". We search many apps, but all over they are hiding out-of-stock items from Shopify which is a simple uncheck from an online store. But we are surprised to see that none of them actually didn't study that what the merchant actually needs. If your store has fewer than 100 items you can actually hide them manually. Then why would someone need that kind of hiding app? On the other hand when some store has more than a thousand items, then it's very simple 10-20 items can go out of stock daily and also can become re-stock daily. We do not find any single store that did not use Facebook, Google for Ad. But how can all other apps forget this simple fact? If you hide your item from the store and get 404 pages you will constantly lose your SEO, product approval from Facebook, Google, Which can result in your account suspension also. After searching a lot we found Nada App!! It's just Awesome !!! exactly does what a real merchant need. Brilliant app interface. Single-click activation. Just active and forget. Like we have 50 thousands+ items but we never need to worry about it. This app doing everything automatically well. The best part is we even can deactivate for some specific collection that we need to keep the newest item first. A complete package in such a small amount. A++++"
"So happy we made the switch from Bold to Bundle Subscriptions. The onboarding team has been amazing, helpful, and worked with our product. We love the ease of use for both our customers as well as from the back end of Shopify. The Build-a-box feature has created a more unique user experience, as well very clean ui-ux design. Highly recommend"
"Here is the truth~ I have been looking for an app for my website for literally a year that does BOTH subscription and CHOOSE your own bundle. It just didn't exist, I had to have someone code two apps together and it was a horrible user experience. I was so glad to hear about Emily and her team at Bundle Subscriptions, I jumped at the chance to get on board as soon as it was available. I was able to delete my two other apps, improve my site speed, get an amazing customer subscription and choose your own bundle app all in 1. I couldn't be happier. I know its only been a few weeks, but we have had no issues and customers are so jazzed about the customer interface. I can't say enough about it~ if you are looking for a subscription or bundle app this is the one you need!"
Just started playing with it. Two great companies partnering in a super smart way. Love it when the user interface is so easy it takes no time to be up and running.
"A revolutionary creation by ShopPad. ""Does exactly what it says on the tin!"" Incredibly easy to use. User interface is clean, crispy and very easy to navigate. The addition of 'emojis' to our products at EuropaBay has already made for better conversion rates, We are getting more clicks, more user engagement all within 24 hours. I would highly recommend this app to ALL. 5 Star must have App, provided by excellent people. Cheers. EuropaBay Limited"
Great interface that allows a large scale of integrations! Their team is very responsive and always happy to help. Highly recommend
"I am selling electronic items where product specification matters a lot. So I wanted to provide my customers with the ability to compare technical specs of several items in one place, which could help them to choose a better product by themselves. I checked in total 7 apps about product comparison. But 6 of them were making comparisons only by basic Shopify product options - price, weight, description and tags - and no comparisons by custom product specifications. I was frustrated and started to think about abandoning the whole idea of product comparison, but then I found THIS awesome app, and it was doing the exact thing I was looking for - comparison of CUSTOM fields! The only thing you should be aware of in the first place - to compare a custom table, you have first to create such a table (using this app) for each product you want to be comparable in your store. That could be a challenge if you have hundreds of different SKUs, but once you input a value, it will be saved for future and can be re-used again in the next table, which makes the process of creating new tables much faster and easier.
Besides easy-to-follow, user-friendly interface, I want to highlight excellent customer support as well. Michael and his colleagues were super-fast in solving my problem with selection of products where names were in Korean letters - thanks a lot, guys!
Also I found the price of the app to be very reasonable, especially in situation where virtually NO other app with the same functionality presented in the app store.
So I definitely want to give 5 stars to ""Comparable"" app and wish the ZubrCommerce team to keep on further with their great work!"
"La Estoy usando en un proyecto grande y hasta ahora chico La Mejor Sin Dudas ! Atención al cliente Super excelente .The best ones I simply recommend 100%
It has easy handling and an incredible interface, the guys have great attention to it and it took some time and I had not left a review!"
"This app was instrumental in getting some of our products moving. We like the interface and implementation within our Shopify account. Of course, it does lend itself to some lowball offers that come in, but it gives some interesting data on what people are willing to pay for certain items."
"Definitely a very well-developed app with rapid and great CS support!!! No worries even if you are weak at coding, since the support team is very helpful and quick in response (usually within 1 day) that they will help you to deal with theme coding & interface coding. My company has ~300 offline vendors and we are gradually adding them online. And this app is very user-friendly that almost most of your inquiries can find an answer, and the app even provides user manuals and tutorial videos for both the admin and the vendors!!! I am just so satisfied. The only withdraw is that the app itself don't not include Chinese language interface (and most of my vendors are Chinese users), you need to install some translation plug-in (which I tried but does not work well) or to translate all the wordings of interface by yourself."
"I'm using this app to build a marketplace. There are a lot of functionalities that I found much more flexible than other platforms, especially when you add plugins. The interface isn't the most beautiful/user friendly, so there's a lot of details you need to check and test to make sure it works well. What I must say though, is the support team is really great and has gone above and beyond to make things work for us - e.g. editing the coding in the themes to make it compatible with the backend, how to ensure the Webkul backend is connected to domains and is viewed as a secure site."
"EU TENHO GOSTADO MUITO, QUERO PODER USAR MAIS E MAIS. É FACIL DE USAR, INTERFACE BONITA E BOM ATENDIMENTO"
"We are so happy to have found Gorgias! The user interface is easy to use and we have saved so much time responding to customer service inquiries using this app rather than just the GMail we had been using. The support is friendly and quick to respond, and we have experienced no issues with the software since we started using it. There are a couple things we would love to see as this platform grows- supported mass email/bcc functionality, ability to create discount codes instead of logging into Shopify, and a more robust search function so we can easily filter our customers. Great overall and would recommend to anyone who is looking for a robust Shopify integration!"
"We've been using Gorgias for several months. Pluses: tight integration with Shopify; easy to combine several points of customer contact; easy to navigate interface. Minuses: mobile app is absolutely terrible - this is really designed for desk bound agents; chat is very limited - you can't really see the customer journey while chatting - we're switching back to our previous chat program. One other issue, it would be nice if it auto sent replies to connected customer email accounts so they also be tracked outside of the app. So far, it's a keeper as their support is pretty responsive and they're constantly upgrading it."
"Gorgias has been our go-to best CRM service so far. We've tried several before, but their customer service and convenient integrations with a very user-friendly interface is what we need to run our business. Very satisfied with Gorgias!"
"Really powerful add-on for your popups. Has everything you need out of the box - designing interface, AB testing, exit intent only (to ensure little to no user promo cannabalisation). Also has the ability for you to add custom display criteria and track all the way through the purchase if you have to a developer to help set up. Highly recommend."
Wisepops is by far the best pop up app in the Shopify ecosystem. A really clean and simple interface for creating elegant on-site experiences + complex segmentation and rules based system. We love this product!
"We have started to use this app at STABLE of Ireland where as a premium luxury brand we are very precious about the UX (user experience) being clouded or distracted with clutter and messaging eg pop ups. Our 1# impression that WisePops is not only a great app to use but that its design, structure and functionality will easily allow us to accurately control and narrowly target relevant on-site promotional type content to improve engagement, consideration and conversion."
Experience with the app has been great. The interface is really good and easy to understand. The team is excellent to help out or resolve issues.
We use this app to help my customers understand how much more they need to spend in order receive free shipping while browsing on our website. It is amazing that you can customize the pop-up per geographical location (for example: our international customers are required to spend more to receive free shipping then our domestic customers). Their support team is excellent if you need guidance on how to set up the app or customize settings for an optimal user experience. Highly recommend!
looks awsome and works great! nice clear user interface and clear steps to follow for setting up the app
"This is my first app review here at Shopify, The app opt-ins are pretty good they cover the most required options to be in good contact with your customers and to recover lost sales opportunities, I like the easy-to-use and simple interface, and with regard to the Support & Service attitude, they're ""EXCELLENT"" you are covered. I recommend ""BiteSpeed Messenger & Whatsapp App"" with confidence thank you."
"This is the very first app I made a review about, it's great, I like the interface with just the right font size and layout. Support is great too..."
"I just installed the app and after some tests it works well. The free plan allows to make a first direct contact with customers and to be closer to them, it's essential to build customer loyalty. Possibility to customize the popup and the different tools, simple and intuitive configuration. The support is reactive and helpful, Vinayak personalized a message for me (impossible to do it from the app interface). I would probably opt for the paid plan with retargeting of abandoned shopping carts in a while. Thanks and good luck to the team ;)"
"absolutely fantastic app. The interface is super user friendly, the features are unbelievable and the customer service is very responsive. Well recommended app"
"very friendly, fast, and easy interface -
all I did was install click a few buttons test to see if the site is faster and done."
"Amazing layout, very nice interface that made setup easy. The pop ups flowed onto my store very nicely.. I did have a little set back of my own and the customer support was RIGHT on it. Would recommend."
A painless way to add some extra zip to make the user experience better for our customers. Thanks for a solid - and free app.
"Support was great, user interface is very easy. Only one that has worked for me thus far. Would recommend."
SUPERGOODAPP! Excellent and FAST Support installed the extra sale icons in a few hours. The Admin interface is self-explanatory and very easy to schedule start and stop times. The ability to prevent discount-code discounts from adding to the on-site sale discount is wonderful! Now I can give my subscribers a discount without having to disable my Daily Deals first.
"Highly recommend, very easy to use interface and works seamlessly on the site. Sergey and team at ASoft go out of their way to support."
"This app has a simple interface,. Itfeels comfortable and simplifies some routine process. It makes starting up a breeze. Seems to me it just needs to show some features are experimental at all mentions of said kinds of features."
"This app has some amazing potential but falls short. The first issue I had was that it was discounting the ""Compare At"" pricing instead of the actual price. That was an easy fix. I just removed the compare price on the items and that seemed to fix the problem. The challenge now is that the app is simply not working. In the app, it will show the items and the discount/sale price, but on the site, it shows the item(s) at the regular price. The interface of this app is stellar and very easy to use. It just doesn't do what it is supposed to. *Update* This app is pretty screwy. It sometimes pulls pricing from the compare at pricing, and other times at the actual pricing. Plus if you have 1 one item at one price and others at another it will sell it at the lowest price on all items. In your reply, you mention that most customers want the discount off the original price. That is not what is happening. Why would I want to take a loss on a product? There have been 2 sales where for some reason the ""Compare At"" pricing had the cost inputted. Not sure how that happened, but it was not done by SDM. However, because SDM discounted the compare at price we took a loss.
*UPDATE2* Please don't misunderstand what I said. I was stating that This app did not put the cost in a cost field. That was not meant to say that it was the fault of someone else. I just wanted to clarify that the app in addition to completely messing up literally all of my inventory, it also did not put in the wrong cost. I have spent the last 6 hours trying to fix what this app did. If I could give this app a negative star rating, I would. In all the reviews I have ever written on shopify for app, this is easily the most negative. If you accidentally make a mistake, or if the app makes a mistake, there is nothing that will revert your store back to what it was before. There are products that this app was never supposed to adjust that are messed up."
"I am writing this review as I have never been 100% satisfied with a software product or an application especially with the  amazing customer support Vinayak  and team is giving us.  The whole interface of the  app is smooth and very user friendly.
We at Worldspace™ strongly recommend using this app if you are just starting out or already making killer sales!! 
With Kind Regards,
Worldspace™ Team"
"Super easy setup with excellent customer-service and easy to use web interface. Also integrates well with my various shipping providers (DHL eCommerce, DHL Express + Sendle)!"
"Great little app that does exactly what it says. Intuitive interface makes it very easy to create, edit and stop promotions. Recommended!"
This my favorite pop-up app I've tried! Very clean and user friendly interface and templates. Their customer support was also very quick to respond to any questions I had.
"I tried a few different currency converter apps before settling on this one. The interface is clean and well integrated and they provide excellent technical support.
There are a lot of features included which are missing on many competing apps and the store looks native in whichever currency is selected."
I haven't started using it yet but would like to compliment you on the interface. Hope it helps me collect emails to create a good mailing list!
Just started using it so can't promise results but the interface is dope
"Nice user interface, helpful guidance and automations, and support that's punctual, professional, and personable. It feels like we have a pleasant team on our side, with the Seguno folks. I'm looking forward to more advanced functionality to be added to the app, too."
"Program with really good potential. But you need to work a little bit more in the interface and dashboard. Sometimes is kind of slow too. 
Maybe I gonna a try it later again. 
Thanks"
***Update review - thank you for working things out. Highly recommended app for protection plan - good user-friendly interface.
"We love the Clyde Warranty Platform. The product and interface is great, but what really has helped us out and saved us a lot of time and effort is the customer service that clyde provides. Any issues or questions that might arise are taken care of quickly and they go the extra mile to help make sure everything is running smoothly. Would definitely recommend. Thankyou!"
"The app and the idea is perfect, it is a great help for building up a store. However the user interface could be more user friendly. Time to time saving items doesn't work perfectly, also could use more supplier sources. The helpdesk is always available and helpful."
"Very powerful app. 1) The Filters App sdds tremendous value to the online browsing experience. The important step is to conceptualise the filters that are relevant to the store category and then setting up the product tags appropriately. But once that is done, the user experience is enhanced. Highly Recommended. 2) The Bulk Edit app is also very very useful. Adding, replacing, deleting tags for a collection is otherwise quite tedious - but with this app it is just a few clicks. 
Money well spent!  Highly Recommended App."
"Veronica from Power tools was an excellent help when I need some guidance tweaking the look of the filter Menu. She responded and had me fixed up within a couple of hours!
I have been using Power tools suite for about 6 months now and it has assisted in user experience and seo beautifully!
Thanks team and Veronica"
"The app installs easily and works well.  The developer put some good thought into the interface.  Setting the cut off time for each date and creating exceptions for holiday are both each tasks.  I think that customers like knowing when a product will ship.  Amazon offers somewhat similar information and I believe customers have come to expect if.  
The app works great, installs easy, the interface is easy to use and the developer is responsive to emails.  If you are looking to keep customers informed of your shipping deadline, this app is an easy one to recommend!"
"Definitely the most Essential app for any store with over 500+ products to infinity.  Everything about the app makes sense with great user experience & the app just runs smooth & clean.  It is also priced very fair to the consumer...bottom line ' am I getting what I paid for' , yes I am.
There's great, good, bad, & just plain terrible apps on Shopify.
This one is Great, try it out and see for yourself."
"Good product and an Awesome Support Team! I have a huge list of products, variants and suppliers.
After ShopMaster closed down I turned to AutoDS. Angelica (Customer Support) suggested some awesome solutions to satisfy my concerns. Einav (Director Global Customer Support) created a custom plan to meet my needs and followed up to ensure a smooth process. Jiselle (Customer Support) provided all the necessary documentation to get setup quickly. Great experience so far using the App. In 1 month I will provide a more detailed update regarding my overall user experience."
Amazing app to look after listings on both my Etsy and Shopify store. So good to have it all in one place with a smooth interface and really great customer service too!
"Tudo fica melhor usando o frete facil do pagseguro. Menos passos, mais rápido, interface de usuário muito simples, tudo que estava ainda faltando no Pagseguro (que metade do tempo não carregava ou trabalhava).
Tivemos a sorte de estar na versão beta, o que nos deu a opção de dar um feedback. O proprietário foi realmente aberto à sugestões e melhorias e juntos, realmente melhoraram o fluxo de trabalho. E eu sei de algumas melhorias mais estão por vir, estou super entusiasmado para vê-las.
Eu realmente recomendo este aplicativo."
"This app is the way you wish Shopify worked right out the box to help you manage your products. Ability to bulk edit anything, manipulate images, manage tags .. I haven't explored all of the functionality yet but it saves SO much time that the cost savings are incredible. Plus a lovely user interface to boot. Customer service has also been very responsive and helpful. Honestly, for $10 a month, this app is a no-brainer decision for your store."
"friendly interface, easy to use, and most importantly - an incredible time saver and efficiency maximizer! so grateful to have discovered it!"
Quite easy to use and install. Not too much of a hassle. Interface is clean and easy and looks pleasant
"We have been using this app for the last 1 year for our Etsy shops and now we have also started using it for our newly developed Shopify site and it is working well with Shopify as well :). The interface is very clean and it is very easy to operate and one can get the job done within a moment.
The one who understands the process of this app will always appreciate the Vela.
Technical support is fantastic, they get the issue resolved very quickly.
Justin is the right person to deal with."
Nice start up guide. So far so good easy to use and user experience looks good. I will recommended to anyone trying to find frequently bought together products.
"✔ Easy to use interface
✔ Drastically reduces human error
✔ Simple Bulk Orders Process
✔ Bulk Fulfillment with Shopify
✔ Integration with eParcel
We have been only using ReadyToShip for less than a week, but the results have been immediate! 
It has really simplified  the entire shipping and fulfillment process for our store and integrates perfectly with eParcel.
It has made a the process of fulfilling bulk orders a breeze, and simple enough that it could be taught to anyone - reducing bottlenecks in the fulfillment process.
I highly recommend this app for any Shopify store that works closely with eParcel and other carriers."
"Super easy set up and intuitive interface for customizing colors and text. Excited to see how it helps drive incremental sales. UPDATE: Sadly, I have dropped down to four stars as the app continually populates an item that is out of stock (out of an assortment of 270 other items it could select). There have never been any sales on this item for which system logic could draw upon, so this appears to be a flaw. It would be great if there was a way to mitigate populating suggested items that are not in stock. In my case, it is the number one item that gets selected by the app for some reason."
This App is a convenient tool. It's easy to set up and quick to use. The slideshows work fine on mobile and desktop. The only issue is that takes a few seconds to load the slideshows which affect a bit the user experience. I'm not sure if that can be resolved. I recommend this App.
"I have been testing out DelightChat for the past 3 weeks and so far loving it! Customer support is Top Notch, going over and beyond to assist with any issues. As soon as I downloaded the app and got in touch with them, the support team created a WhatsApp group where I could message the team and they would immediately respond to any queries I had. The interface is very clean and pleasant, nicely designed and organised and for the wide array of features included I feel the price is well worth it. I would highly reccomend this app for anyone looking to centralise facebook, instagram, whatsapp and other social media into 1 place for easy communication with customers."
"Very easy to use interface, many great features, on top of that the customer support was amazing and helpful.
Love it."
I used the app for my customers to track their orders. It seems very nice interface and working good. Also I had an instant good support for my questions. Highly suggest!. Good luck..
Super easy to use. Clean and classy interface. Lots of customization options too. The best thing about it is that it's free.
"We decided to switch our Customer Service platform due to a complicated pricing system (which resulted expensively) and somewhat lack of integration possibilities between our Shopify store and Whatsapp Business. I came across the website of DelightChat and the creators sounded familiar to me. Turns out I'm already using a similar Whatsapp application of theirs in all my stores. As I'm writing this review, we finally finished integrating all support Channels (E-mail, FB/IG, Whatsapp, Shopify stores) which took us a couple of days to do carefully. A summary of what I like about DelightChat so far: - E-commerce orientated, it shows up customers/order details and can send templates using the dynamic variables of the Shopify Data (Name, OrderID, tracking URL, etc.)
- With the integration of our Support Emails, we finally have a one-stop Customer Support platform. For me as a store owner, this simplifies the overview of all tickets and enables us to better guide our support staff.
- Fair and foremost SIMPLE pricing, also really important from my perspective :) - After the initial onboarding call, we directly created a Whatsapp Group and since then I had 24/7 support with the DC Team for integrations and all other questions. - They are open to feedback and looking for active cooperation in the platform development. When I addressed some improvements on User Experience (from my perspective), we directly organized a call and I will receive an update on this matter after their next team meeting. This gives me confidence that if our company needs some additional features, DC is there to support and fulfill this need. All the best and success for the team DelightChat"
"The app works perfect, support respond quikly. Friendly good looking interface that fits to any theme"
This is app has a good interface. I've faced difficulties with other apps and have found this to be the best out of them.
App fully functional and bug free. It helped alot with user experience. I gave it five star as it is worth it
Recommended for every new seller out there. This app has a good interface and tracking is awesome. Loving it
"Nope. Horrible user interface and ridiculous billing system. They make you upgrade PER gallery, so if you want to want only two galleries with more than 6 pics each, you end up paying upwards of $24/ month which is ridiculous for an image slider. Looking to switch to something else, but bummed Shopify doesn't offer more slider apps considering how robust the site is supposed to be. Monopoly of an app is right. NAGL."
"The app is okay if it is compatible with your needs, but has some issues.  I was using it on Brooklyn Theme, works only with product image display set to THUMBNAILS.  Doesn't work with Brooklyn Theme if you want to show your images as STACKED (large images).  Doesn't  work on Mobile (only shows 1st selected variant image, doesn't swipe to other set images for the selected variant).  Easy to use interface, but quite clunky and time-consuming to set up the images by variant (eg. Product with 4 colors and 4 sizes, you need to set up 16 variants individually... cannot apply a set of images to apply to all sizes of same color), or not possible to copy a set of images to another variant. Overall decent for a FREE app, but could be fixed up..."
"Sellvia and its team are amazing! I've used other apps for the means of drop shipping and none of them compare to Sellvia. The easy to use interface that Sellvia provides along with their ready-made marketing materials are BIG time savers. Moreover, the product descriptions/pages and ads are very clean cut which help bring a unique type of aesthetic to any store. Despite limited product variety, all in all, one of the best dropshipping apps out there!"
Really cool analytics app. I like the forecasting tool and how clean the interface is.
"Look no further this is THE best app for delivery date selection ! We are in the fast food business and this app is a god sent ! Worth every penny and more for the super duper fast technical support, beautiful interface and 100% working app! We faced a slight hitch on our site and the helpful zestard team fixed it almost immediately! 
No more lost revenue or muddled deliveries! 
Special thanks to Anuj ! For adding us on skype to provide faster support even late into the night! 
Best ever experience with an app developer and technical support team. 
We have tried so many different apps and programmers. The guys at zestard really know what they are doing.
We love it so much we have it on all our sites."
Excellent app and amazing customer service!!! The user interface is simply and easy to use. Perfect for creating invoices.
Brilliant and thoughtful app. The developers of this app have included all the possible use cases of the return-refund-exchange process. User and seller friendly interface. Prompt support team. The team was extremely helpful while onboarding process and resolving our concerns. Definitely recommend for channelizing the Returns Process
customer service was very helpful to answer my smaller questions about user interface! the program is easy to navigate.
The setup interface is excellent. Not use yet but so far so good. Hopefully everything goes well. The paid plans are reasonable.
"2 star for easy installation and OK interface]. On May 30th, signed up for the basic package [$120 that claims 250-500 visitors] to test this out and then determine what package we would increase to; as needed. It said to give it up to 90 days to run and gain traction, which we were prepared to do, but after running for about 18 days, it literally paused on its own with the below message requesting more money to continue. 
Results: No sales [except one visitor asking for free samples] and today we got the below message after it claims that it drove 160 Visitors driven (last 30 days) and 1.7 Ad avg. position (last 30 days) : 
""Your Campaigns Were Paused.
Due to the nature of your target audience (demographic and geographic) required in order to convert a visitor into a paying customer, we had to drive traffic to your website which was more expensive and exhausted your marketing budget. Your campaigns will be reactivated upon your next recurring charge which is set for 30-Jun-2019 or if you'd push forward your next round of payment please contact us.""
====
So basically it stopped itself from running and will only run again if we upgrade the plan now to $250 or above. Or until the next billing cycle comes around on June 30th, though it has only delivered 160 targeted traffic [much less than the 250-550 estimation for this plan]. 
Conclusion: Willing to try this again in the future and upgrade the rating...once we can figure out how this really works. But for now we will remove it; since the app took $120 for 30 days and then decided to pause itself after 18 days, is defeating the purpose of it adjusting/learning and building/ramping up traction and traffic [So it just ate $120 and looking to be fed more at our loss]. Thanks."
"The product works very well. I reached out to support with an observation/suggestion about user experience, and they had implemented what I asked for within a single hour. The only feature I would suggest would be the ability to customize how the floating cart looks on your site (by uploading your own icon, perhaps, or choosing from some different icon options)."
"After 20 years as a developer and 5 years working with Shopify I can genuinely say Stock&Buy has one of the best teams focused on their App that I have ever interfaced with.  
I put in a feature request that our accounting team needed in order to move our Inventory Management over to Stock&Buy — received a commitment from Stock&Buy to complete the feature and here I am less than one month later with the feature complete.
Developing Shopify apps is not easy and these guys make it seem like a piece of cake.  If I could put them to work full time on my projects I 100% would — since that's not possible, I'll just move all my clients / projects to Stock&Buy ASAP to take advantage.
Great work guys."
"This app is in my top ten must have list. Straight forward interface, great features for sales, bundles, upselling and gifting all in one app. You can schedule and create secret links or wholesale pricing. All at a Great Value!"
We have been loving Stock and Buy app - this has been a great system for managing inventories between our stores. And their support team is great to work with - they listen to your needs and work hard to improve the user experience!
"This app has already allowed me to discontinue use of a couple of other apps and save money each month, and i've only scratched the surface of what it can do. On top of that, the app is detail oriented, with a great user interface in addition to a simple back end. I had a question for the developers, and not only did they answer same day, but they logged into my shopify store and made the fix for me. I'm 100% happy with this app, and have bought it for my second Shopify store too!"
"I cannot recommend this app enough. It is the best app I have ever used. It is easy to setup, intuitive and effective. The app does exactly what you need it to. The customer-facing interface is smooth and professional. 
I am a new shop owner and I am cheap so I tried to stick to free apps. I ended up with 4-5 apps that overlap to get the full suite of features I needed. The shop UI got cluttered, and the different apps have slightly different styles, so the customer experience is a total mess. 
This app does it all and does it better than any of the other apps. I am only 3 days in and still have 12 free trial days left, but I am going to be very happy paying $15 a month for this incredible tool. 
My only suggestion to Treedify is to improve your customer service communications. While my support requests are always acted on quickly and effectively, the communication is short and abrupt. It can come off as unfriendly. When I read your response to customer feedback, I can tell that the person writing the responses is probably a developer and not trained in customer service skills. This is going to hurt you a lot when you want to grow the company."
"I tried this app but the vendor I was going to use it with decided to do their own thing so I didn't continue using it.    
However, the installation was very easy and the interface is quite straightforward.   Removing the app was also easy and no hassle, which is quite a treat over some experiences I've had with subscription software.
The developer, Rob, is responsive and friendly over email."
"Great value for money and I don't understand why isn't Selly receiving more reviews. Support is helpful, prompt and quick. Even with a simple interface, Selly is able to cover most of promo mechanisms we have in mind - which otherwise will require us installing multiple apps of different complexities. Thanks Selly!"
"Honest review.
In just 2 hours of having installed the app, I already had conversions.
Something that I like most about the application is that it has practically everything in one. 6 different strategies to increase the average value of purchases per customer.
The interfaces are very easy to use to create any offer.
You can customize the colors with those of your store.
VERY IMPORTANT
The support, extremely impressive, very fast and effective.
This app practically pays for itself.
I RECOMMEND IT TO ALL."
"The developers are really great to work with. You will get response to your queries in minutes. They even help you setup or find solutions if there is any issue while configuring the app with your template. Secondly, the app itself has a very user-friendly interface and easy to configure if you choose the right template. Every template out there is created differently by different designers and integration of this app with some templates might not be seamless. However, if you hit a roadblock just email the developers and they will help your out. On the down side, a recurring $6 per month seem slightly expensive. At least for someone like me from India. All in all a great and possibly the best app if you want video background in your Shopify store."
"Dja mucho de desear. No funciona bien. La interface entre Conekta y Shopify NO funciona. Si el cliente paga en Oxxo, la informacion nunca llega a Shopify. Servicio de ayuda me pidó hasta videos de la configuración y me dice que todo esta bien. Sigue sin funcionar. Busco otra alternativa"
"I've been using this app for a couple of days now, and so far have had no troubles at all. The support team is really kind and very fast. I would recommend it to everyone who is seeking for good interface and great experience!"
"Dash101 is amazing, I am using this app for almost 3 months now. I have had bad experience with other logistic apps and was a bit skeptical with Dash101 but they proved me wrong, they are extremely professional reliable have excellent customer services, If you are looking for free online store then this is application would be an awesome one. this is of the best app for online store as well as for your shipping needs. User friendly interface which will make our lives easier.
Good app, easy to install, good services
Customer support is good and hands-on. Wish there was an option to enter SKU, and auto-fill product dimensions."
"This app is just awesome! We've only been using it since yesterday, so we still have a lot of features to explore. However, the interface is so intuitive that it is a real pleasure to work in these conditions.
We haven't published on the active theme yet, but on an unpublished version. We hope that everything will work fine during the publication because the rendering is really more professional and more attractive from a marketing point of view.
A very available customer support who responds quickly and finds solutions. It's appreciated."
"It's a really good app. Helped me fix a couple of dire issues which prevented my viewers from finishing a purchase. Plus, it helps me understand the user experience of my key pages. My only issue, which is probably not a huge one to others but which I have yet to find a way around in the case of my site, is that the software slows the page load speed of my site. Otherwise, it's a really awesome app that I would recommend over and over.

"Client service is great ! Very helpful and effective. The app works very well and there is a lot of templates and options to customise your slider. The interface is a bit old and not always user friendly, but they are coming with an update soon!"
"I love the Wordpress version. This is not that.
I paid $18 for the ability to import a slider. Instead of importing my slider ZIP, it broke the entire slide editing interface, rending the whole plugin useless. 
I hope someone combines the JQuery version of Revolution Slider and the jQuery Revolution Slider editor correctly with a Shopify admin interface. Someone could make some serious money with a functioning Shopify Revolution Slider app."
muito fácil de usar e muito mais pratico do que imaginei gostei da interface do app muito bom para uso
I use dynamic currency converter to help me on currency exchange. Thank you it help in growing my business and smoothing user experience.
"Easy setup, features work as designed. Mainly however we use the standalone app of InkFrog. Clean interface, Robust"
I just began to use it so I cannot say that it works. However the user interface looks simple and easy to use.
"this app is a life changing tool, user interface is very cool and we looking to reduce the abandoned carts by 50%..thanks"
"Easy to use interface and product import feature, very happy with the app itself.
However, seem to be experiencing a bug that does not let me keep the adjusted logo size - it just sticks with the original template logo size no matter what I try. Support hasn't been helpful at all in following this up further, quite disappointed to be honest. Hoping this will get resolved and will adjust rating accordingly."
This app is really gooooooooooddddddddd... I would recommend this app. The interface of this app is really good.
So Ive just installed Care Cart and the user interface is great! Looking forward to seeing how much money i recuperate!
"I used this app to build customer engagement & also collect emails. It is a very simple interface to use, customizable to my store's brand, and liking. Support is readily available and always looking for ways to improve your experience. The app works like a charm, TFC&H Co. appreciated & approved!!!"
"Fantastic! The most responsive support team assisting me, which is extremely important when you try to set up some kind of customization on your store. Well thought out User Interface, and logic behind the customizer. Would definitely recommend!"
"I love this app. It totally runs our store. Without crowdfunding, my cogs include all kinds of incorrect guesses about sizes, popular colors, etc. Putting crowdfunding on my site allows me to reduce those cogs, and reduce the price to my customer.
Customer service from the app is incredibly responsive - although I think they live in a time zone other than mine, so it's usually the next day. They are willing to work with me to do just about any new / different thing. 
I appreciate that I can customize just about any part of the customer interface. 
In response to the person who said that they have to figure out how not to charge until fulfillment (or reaching of goal), I'm afraid that's a Shopify thing. The reason to have the crowdfunding app on your site is so that customers can also buy other items from your store at the same time. Therefore, the checkout gateway is Shopify's, not Crowdfunding Manager's.
Some of the language they use was not clear to begin with, for example, I did not understand what it meant to archive a campaign. But, once you tinker with it, it actually works perfectly."
"I love it, the user interface is really  easy to use. What I like the most is that it's free (contrary to a lot of Shopify apps)."
Finally! this is what I've been looking for. Great app as well as beautiful User Interface. Recommended :)
Great support thank you Abby for your help. Getting arround to discover the app I have just install. The interface seems user friendly.
"Clean & clear interface, user friendly. Very happy so far."
"This is Poor App, The App look very organized and giving good info as article to read, but the App is not doing anything once i save and it is doing nothing automatically * I updated the Alt text template and it never updates the images even after 2 days
* I updated the Meta details and it never updates the page/products even after 2 days
* As final trial to use the App i updated Single Product Tile and checked the product in Shopify, it was never updated in the Shopify Product Page I give two stars for the interface and Poor feedback for the App This is Poor App,"
Fantastic APP & Wonderful Customer Service. Easy To Install. Beautiful Interface And Relatively Easy To Use. Would Highly Recommend To Others. A++++ Intimately Yours Limited.
"Excellent app that delivers everything you'd want it, too. And all in one place. Simply interface, easy to install and a doddle to use."
"This is the first Shopify app I have used where I found it so useful that I had to write a review. I have been running my store for roughly three months now, and I was very skeptical of spending the $8.99/mo for this app (I know it isn't much, but it's a lot when you're starting out and struggling to hit profitable). It has been very well worth it so far.
Before installing the app I would, at best, get an organic session once every couple of weeks. Improving organic reach has been incredibly tedious since I have over 500 products in my store, so editing every image, SEO description, title, etc is too demanding. I installed the app and decided to give it a shot and see what happens.
The interface is intuitive and super easy to use. Everything is laid out really well. The dashboard page makes it easy to get started and understand what you need to do. Adding SEO fields to products is effortlessly simple once you get started. Overall, it took me an hour at the very most to get it all set up.
In the first two weeks after adding the app, I forgot about it and began to assume that the SEO changes had little to no effect. It wasn't long after that though that I started consistently seeing 3-7 organic sessions daily. Mind you, for a store in the first 4 months this feels incredible. For a larger or more established store, I imagine that one would see a much larger increase.
I highly recommend this app for getting your SEO up and running. Everything in the app can certainly be done manually or by editing the CSV file and uploading it to Shopify. If you can't spare the $8.99 a month, then definitely look into that route. Otherwise, give the app a shot and a couple of months for results to kick in. It'll be worth it."
Great installation support from BOLD. Easy to use interface and very flexible in setting up the points system. I see an increase in new sign ups. Customers love the shop n earn program. www.pontusfolio.com
"Order logic is one of the simplest applications I have used, with a clean interface I can easily define my minimum and maximum order requirements.
OL allows multiple congruent order quantities to be set and if the customer attempts to spam the checkout button or refresh the page and add an extra item, Order Logic picks up the change and serves a popup to disallow transaction.
The application covers multiple different edge cases and is a secure application for dealing with shopify order quantities. When promoting a free + shipping offer it can be difficult to catch increases in cost where the product is £0, this app allows you to define special cases that mean you will never spend more than you receive."
"Highly recommend this app if you need to implement minimum order rules.
1) The interface to manage your products on the back-end is straight forward and effective. It's customizable without being confusing. 
2) The developers that we worked with were extremely helpful and prompt. After a 30 minute phone call, they made several changes to customize the app for our needs all within 1 day.
Very good experience,
Justin @ Lead Apparel"
"LOVE, Love, love it! This is the 3rd app of this type that I have tried. I let the lack of reviews deter me but boy was I wrong! The others are unreliable and the user interface aren't as great. This was an instant install, it's easy to use and does the job. Highly recommended if your store requires minimum quantity purchases like mine does. Check it out in action at www.jubileefavors.com"
"Really solid app. Great interface, comprehensive and really helps you dial in on your SEO. Great for beginners to experts."
"A great app that does exactly what it says so, excellent user interface and fast support when needed. There is a small issue with the mobile integration when the app is on the top of the screen if this is fixed everything would be great."
"Intuitive interface that makes it super easy to build customizable Facebook catalogs. The support team was very responsive to inquiries and addressed all concerns quickly and effectively. The app met and exceeded every expectation, and we would definitely recommend for businesses of all sizes pursuing Facebook advertising."
Really excellent user interface. I just downloaded but I have high hopes.
Very easy interface made it east to set up.
"user friendly interface, but a bit too pricey for the job it does but still it doesn't matter if you are getting conversion after using this"
Excellent app. Used this app for Frequently Bought Together function. Beautiful interface and easy to use
"Clear interface, Easy to use, Just follow the instruction, Step by Step! Will upgrade to pro version."
This is the perfect tool to analyze customer behaviour on the webshop. I can see actual customers coming in on certain paiges and clicking through the website. Easy to use interface. I like that the have a free subscription for small starting webshops as well. Recommended
"I recently downloaded this app and already know the ins and outs, very simple interface. The customer service and tech support were responsive and very helpful - our store uses infinite options so we can't add to cart straight from the bundle widget, they were able to take that button off the widget which was great. The bundling process is great and they say they're continually expanding on the methods you can constrain your bundles."
Very easy to use bundler app. First time using it and got the job done. Easy interface to add products to bundle. Has enough features to customize how bundle should work and be put together.
Love it!! this app is simple to use. It shows what visitors are doing on my web so that I can improve the user experience.
love ability to view user experience. highly recommend this app for startups or those want to analyze customers interest etc.
I used the app to see how users were experiencing my site interface. What I learned is users shopping from a mobile device never saw some of the product offerings because of the site design. An improved Theme and design was in order and has been implemented. Thank you Replay Live!
"Coolence is AWESOME. I switched from AbandonApp and have never looked back. Cleaner, less cluttered interface and awesome support. Get it now!
Update 12/10/14: Still using it 2 years later, still loving it just as much!"
Very clean and easy to use interface. My questions were promptly answered via live chat. Great service!
"Fast and good communication as well as a very supportive team that worked on our special requests even after the sale. The team was very flexible, understood our requirements and made great suggestions for their implementation. The design now seamlessly fits into our pre-existing website and conveys the intended user experience. Can only recommend! We’re very happy with our customizations and the way the app works."
Great app if you are looking to improve your user experience and customer journey. Would highly recommend this app.
Very easy to set up.  Can style it to match your website.  Does not interrupt user experience.  Great for mobile!
"Great interface, and looking forward to the future updates and especially heat mapping. Would like to see real-time support."
A great app with clean templates and a very intuitive interface. The customer support is quick. I really recommend.
"love it so far it's very fast and the performance level of it is immaculate. Also, the interface is easy to navigate through I recommend this to anyone."
"Great  Very efficient app, quick assistance and amazing team, I love the user experience as well!!"
"We use this app to watch customer behavior and look for ways to improve the user experience. It is incredibly helpful and gives us insights that we simply cant get anywhere else. For example, we can see customers cart behavior to observe how they buy so we can consider ways to improve conversion rates."
"Brilliant App. Help me out a lot with the comprehension of the user experience in a easy way as I´m not a developer.
Thanks!"
Cette application permet efficacement de mettre en place un suivi et avec une bonne interface. Je recommande.
"I love this app! It was so easy to install, and the interface was clear and simple. Very pleased I chose this app above the others. I particulary like the choice of header or footer bars, and choice of animation. Thank you."
"Does what it is supposed to, easy interface and responsive support team. Happy with the app, recommend to any OPs/ecomm manager."
i used this app.İnterface very cool and easy to use.It gives you many information about visits.With it you can track and improve your store.
"Upon using the app the creating pages function doesn't work (Slim Server Error). Many times upon updating values or data, the display doesn't update... need to reload the faq admin page.
Clunky interface and unoptimised workflow."
"I connected Smart Popup a few days ago, a clear interface for setting up a pop-up window, and I am very pleased with this application, see what the results will be and give a more extensive review of Smart Popup."
Its my first time using this app and i found that it has an amazing interface and its pretty fun to use. ;)
"App developer provided outstanding support. From arranging a call back after initial email discussions, and providing a a walk through on app, answering some GMC config questions. I couldn't ask for more. Not to mention with complete clarity, patience, and total product knowledge with best practices with shopping ads and user experience as well. I highly recommend using this app without any 2nd thoughts."
It's a super customizable and editable app. I wasn't able to see my edits taking effects live so I contacted support through whatsapp (immediate reply) and they helped me right away. The interface is a little confusing but I hope it'll be improved in the future. Thanks guys!
Great customer service. Highly recommended for multi-currency feeds. Intuitive interface and easy to use.
"Very well built, a pleasure to use, integrated very easily with my current Theme style, flexible, robust. Pleasant interface that makes using it a breeze and cuts down learning curve. All around great product and well priced."
I tried so many google shopping app and this one finally solved my problem It's a very easy to use and simple interface without any complexity The best thing is that you can create a feed based on a collection (which was what I'm looking for) so you can test your shopping ads based on category if you target different customers. Upload the feed was smooth and customer support was great Thank you
Easy to install and use the app. Great user experience in the back end. Helps to increase conversion rate.
"Love the interface and the rules, but at the end of the day there are often times when it doesn't trigger when it's supposed to. I use this to push different orders to different 3pls and when it's not reliable there are many issues. Unless they can get reliability up I'm currently looking to find another tag app, but may all tag apps have this issue."
"Awesome app and even better support. It is easily customizable and the user interface is very intuitive.
Highly recommend"
Great app! Clean interface and easy to customize and set up! Easiest way to increase social validation of your product
The app is great. Very good interface and features. I like how easy it is to publish the app and preview it before publishing. 100% recommended.
"Easy to use, easy interface and good service. Overall one of the best translator apps for shopify i have been able to find. The customer service and response time are also very good, so if you are looking for an app for your site, this is it!"
Great experience with the team when we needed help with the app! Simple and easy to use interface. Great app
Great experience with the developer team when we needed help with the app! Clean and functional interface. Recommended to install!
"Dropified est une magnifique application. J'en est testé plusieurs pour mettre en place ma boutique. Elle est très performante et son interface est compréhensible et tres abordable pour les non informaticiens. Je la recommande egalement  pour la qualité de l'équipe, de l'accompagnement, des supports techniques accessibles en français aussi . Une base sérieuse pour faire du drop shipping."
"Amazing App & easy to use, interface is user-friendly.
Specifically on Walmart CA it helped me a lot to save my time. Thank you."
It's a very helpful app for dropshipping automation it's simple and easy to use interface with one-click import products.
"Great app,i'd love to see a better interface and a font changer for the timer"
"EDIT : thanks to the founder who have reacted very quickly, all issues are fixed. I was trying the app at the wrong moment, it lasted only for an hour or so, I was in this bad hour. 
Now this app deserve 5 stars. Get it now !
---------------------------
Good idea, good options... But HORRIBLE admin interface, making this app UNUSABLE:
- You have edit your texts, colors, etc... And save them up to 10 (!!) times to really save them.
- Product settings is randomly : awfully slow to load, popping message session is expired (after 2 mins ?!), displaying not styled message to go rate the app here.
I don't see how I can continue after the Trial... Or continue the Trial itself !"
"Awesome app, really easy interface. Took less than 5 minutes to get it set up, can't wait to see the results!"
"For the more technical blocking of customers, simple and easy interface for booking by country and IP. Was really useful to block countries I'm not interested in sending products to."
"I'm using this app to add reviews to our Shopify store from our Amazon sales channel. I'm happy with the interface of the app, very easy to use! very friendly customization options and make your site look professional. Overall the app works flawlessly. A few times we needed a few extra features and assistance from them. The support team sorted it for us in no time. Highly recommended."
Very good so far. Great support and a lot of features for a decent price! The interface is very clear and the setup for review requests/widgets extremely easy.
"Easy to install, simple interface, does what I need it to do! I was having one issue that I needed help with and Clark responded quickly and helped resolve that issue as well as helped create a landing page for me to link to from IG in addition to having the pop up scheduler on the site. Thanks!"
Extend is a fantastic service that has improved my bottom line while also providing a great asset to my customers. I highly recommend using this provider over others in the industry. The service you receive with Extend is amazing. My account manager Dan is always helping me make improvements to the user experience and I'm very grateful to have him as a member of our team.
"Just getting started using this app: the interface seems simple enough, so so far, so good! I had a few questions, so I used the chat button to talk to Clark, who was super helpful and got things sorted for me quickly. Definitely recommend trying out this app and seeing how it can work for you."
"The app is easy to use with a nice interface. Lots of good functionality. Our store locator went down the other day and I contacted support. They responded fairly quickly, within 4 or 5 business hours and got it back up. They are always very helpful. They told me it went down because of an upgrade. It would have been nice if we got a notice when upgrades are happening so we could check and make sure nothing happened. I got lucky and happened to be working on it when it went down. Otherwise I may not have known until a customer reported it. That's the only reason I gave a 4 instead of 5 stars."
I just installed this application and i'm very pleased with it. The interface is very easy to understand and i managed to get up and running in 10 minutes. I had some questions and the dev team was very quick to reply and help me. I'm still in the trial period but i'm confident i will continue using it (i already uninstalled the paid app i had before)
Quick setup of the application. Simple and intuitive interface. Operational work on setting up the store.
Very good support. I really like their app interface & very user friendly. Easy to install and widgets are really beautiful.I strongly recommend LAI AliExpress Review app
"We love this app for our business. Its got a highly intuitive interface that gives you everything you need to know at a glance. Great products and a fantastic sourcing agent. We highly recommend Eprolo to anyone out there!
Updated: I finally received my goods after over a month. Packing quality was sub par. For the time being Eprolo has lost my trust. The only thing good about Eprolo has been my agent. Her service has been above average. Eprolo will need to regain my trust and prove they can supply items in a timely manner at a good cost. Also, Eprolos product selection is very poor most of what I want to sell I have to import from Aliexpress. If Eprolo wants my review to get to 4 or 5 stars they must regain and earn my trust back FIRST."
Interface is way more user friendly than CJ or Oberlo. You can add logos and everything!!!!!!!! dope
Best dropshipping app. The ordering system is really smart and user interface is customer friendly. Thank you
"We have had a great experience integrating Veeqo with our Shopify store. The integration with our warehouse is seamless, and we are able to track multiple channels pretty simply. The customer service is very good, I never have any issues getting in touch with questions. It would be great to see some improvement in the reporting capabilities, more flexible data retrieval and more user friendly interfaces would definitely make our lives easier."
"I have been working with this application for almost a year, and I can say that it has become much better, more stable, and faster. The interface is improved. I'm surprised that I can control it through my smartphone because it adaptive. However, there are things that I would like to suggest for improvement: 1. resolve the common issue with Shopify 100 variants limit 2. I noticed the another issue - sometimes when BD changing the structure of the product in their website (for example adding or merge new variant) it don't sync with shopify and the product in Shopify still are in old version, so it needed to be deleted and re-imported again.
3. I would prefer to be able to pay for the app in advance (for me would be convenient to be able to pay annually or half annually) but now it offers only monthly payment."
I really want to thank the developers for making such an app. Clean interface and gets the work done beautifully.
"This is very powerful software with absolute first class support. The support is definitely needed for people like me, because while it's powerful it's also complicated (for example, there are multiple ways to accomplish the same thing). I am not personally crazy about the user interface for a number of reasons. My first time around with the app was not ideal - I had a hard time wrapping my brain around the structural concepts due to the UI/nav. Circled back to try again because we really really need it, and ever since I finally understood it better, with some patient hand-holding, I've been fine. Most importantly, the level of support and detailed guidance and assistance is simply unparalleled in my experience with Shopify apps across the board. Timely, detailed, thoughtful, you name it. And that's why I wouldn't even consider docking a star for the UI. Big shout out to Paul for excellent assistance throughout."
"Customer support has responded to me within an hour each time I've asked a question.  Their app documentation is also really good.
I was able to build the exact shipping scenarios for my carrier accounts through Intuitive's interface AND test all of it for free on my own schedule with their amazing test mode feature.
If you want to collect exact shipping charges for all of your shipping zones and create specific rules for users based on tags as well this app will get it done."
"The App is easy to use and products are reasonably priced.
The interface is user friendly and making changes to suit your needs is easy."
I can say it is the best app. User interface is clean and organized. Also customer support is really great.
"This app is great for managing anything beyond a very basic shipping setup. If your store uses multiple box sizes for shipping, this app will choose the best box size for each order. The interface is very intuitive, and if anything doesn't make sense, Joel provides timely and professional support. Overall, this app is a lifesaver."
Brilliant search functions and great user interface. A great alternative to the larger most well known website! From what I have seen so far I would highly recommend!
"Extremely simple. Did it in 5 min like the other user. Shopify interface as if you were creating one disc code on Shopify, but you are creating multiple."
"This app has changed my shipping life. As a Canadian e-commerce store, I was having difficulty finding an app that could work with Canada Post while also calculating how many of my unique, handmade items could fit into a shipping box. This app does it all in a very intuitive, easy to use interface. 
This app works with multiple shipping providers, custom delivery times, custom delivery descriptions, multiple packages, unique product dimensions, unique shipping scenarios and much more.
The developer also offered incredibly helpful and timely support when I encountered some configuration challenges. I am so glad to have found this app and the development team behind it."
"The app itself is brilliant, it has done everything I wanted and needed it to do and was so versatile in how it could be tweaked and changed and adapted to my specific business.
Joel went above and beyond in helping me out. Sending me links to information I needed, walking me through the different steps I needed to know, explaining why he didn't recommend the course of action I had selected with the app (using city names instead of postal code generated shipping zones) and then helping and showing me what I needed to do. Explaining why inputting individual item sizes and weights was not a good idea and encouraging me to go with 5 standard shipping box sizes that will address 99% of my shipping requirements and wont cause issues and higher shipping rates through the Canada Post interface. Being right there when I needed further clarification on something.
I walked away from this experience and purchase with so much respect for Joel and his Intuitive Shipping app. It not only looks after our needs today but can be easily adapted to grow and change with our company
A heartfelt ""Thank You"" Joel. You are amazing and how everyone that produces a product should stand behind their business and what they are offering!"
"Love this app! Clean interface, easy to navigate, low cost and works perfectly for setting up discounts based on customer level and product."
"Has a good Ali import feature, the user interface is clean and well-organised, plus they have a good customer service team for all your queries."
"We have been using Zen Desk for over 4 years but had to cancel it this month. They are way behind the times when it comes to automation/Ai support, have poor customer service, a clunky ap interface and the cost is high with many additional fees for additional agents, programs etc. Also their billing is a bit shady with auto-renewals and no refunds for cancellations. 2 stars because Zen Desk worked well for us for years, but there are much better options out there."
"It's interface is not that far off from Amazon.  That is Amazon from 2012.  It's very crude.  The inventory cannot be exported for bulk changes easily.  The inventory cannot be changed inside the interface without a bulk upload.  Seriously.  You can't change the inventory count of anything without an XLS upload or by bulk selecting multiple products and adjusting count of them all at the same time.  Amazon shows updates within 15 minutes.  Walmart doesn't show changes even a day later.  Walmart screwed up the linking of Shopify variants, so that requires them all to be fixed.  But I can't tell if they've been fixed because of the days long lag between fixes and seeing if the fixes have actually been applied.  I got an order from a customer, but it was so screwed up we had to cancel it.  You can't unpublish an item to fix it ""offline"", so instead I have my entire inventory set to 0 until the problems are resolved.  But then, I'll have to painstakingly restore inventory levels to the correct, different amounts for 900 SKUs.  Can't wait."
"I like this app a lot. I jumped from BOLD to W3 and am not looking back. Here are my key points
-Best product options app for Shopify
-Simplest Interface, very intuitive
-The ability to copy and paste long lists of options
-Simple conditional Logic
-Great support
Our products support a ton of variation.  The biggest challenge we have is the need to support a fairly large make/model structure, with 20 or so “make” options conditionally showing about 300 total models.  Building this out was so tedious in the BOLD offering and a pain to maintain/edit.  With this app, we simply maintain a spreadsheet of all of our options, and then copy/paste the entire list in. SO MUCH FASTER!    The interface is l much cleaner, the logical structure/relationships are much more intuitive, and has a much lower learning curve than others I have tested.
This was the last vestige of BOLD apps being on our store and I’m glad to have found a replacement.  It's great to finally ditch the bad UI I’ve found in every BOLD App.
UPDATE 2/19/19
You can't beat the customer support and responsiveness of W3Trends. They just did some custom work for me on this app, charged me a fair price, and had it finished in less than a day.  They will be my go-to team for any future shopify development."
This app has allowed us to create all the complex personalization features for our custom wine box products. The interface is easy to use and well designed. The support team always responds quickly to questions and are overall very helpful.
"This has proven the best program on shopify if you are a retailer with products that need many different kinds of options, some required, some optional, some text boxes needed for measurements, etc. The interface also makes it easy to attach more than 1 product to the set of options instead of having to edit each individual product. From a customer stand-point, the design and interface is easy to choose and see the added prices for different options, etc. Finally, their customer service has been a huge help! I had entered code incorrectly and they went in and made the fix for me for no charge. I highly recommend W3 as your options editor."
"We have been in business for 7 years and this is our first review. This is app is excellent. Period. We came to this app for email list building (entrance pop-up). Before that we tried and used most existing solutions on the Shopify App store. We are now also using Personizely for cross-sell pop-ups (after add to cart and before check-out) and abandoned carts (triggered on exit intent).
It just works. The user interface is clear; you can go from an out of the box template and then add very extensive and in-depth customizations.
Our preferred feature is A/B testing: test up to 5 variations and clearly see which one is preforming the best. We recently started to use the ""personalization"" feature, opening a whole new world by enabling us to customize shopper experience. Basically, you can show a totally different store, to different shoppers. The cross-sell and abandoned cart popups pay for the app and more. Now the best part is the support. These guys must sleep with the support chat window open... The app is super easy to set up but can also do very complex and powerful stuff: so we needed help several times. We always received knowledgeable, quick and clear answers. Talk about accountability? they send you the chat transcript right away...! You can also have a chance to chat with the founder..."
"Very user-friendly dashboard and interface, even better support and even BETTER results. Between 15-20% AOV boost. Very recommended!"
Find the app straightforward and very easy to use! The interface also looks great with a few nice looking templates.
"I think this app is very good and very convenient to use, but I am still trying to see how to make the interface more beautiful, especially this app is free, it is very good for our first use of shopify, of course, if you use it , Will spend money to use in the future"
"The application forces you to pay for almost everything related to customization, which is what makes the user interface very bad and it cannot work with different themes"
Cross-sell and upsell features help me to increase my sales. Good performance until now. Clean and simple interface.
Gopinath was very helpful and fast to reply with help! The app is very easy to use and customers seem to enjoy the interface.
"Personizely has an incredibly easy-to-use interface that allows you to create any type of widgets in just a few clicks. Also, it helped has to drastically increase our sales without less effort. Recommend!"
"Undeniably THE best social proof app on the market today. The customer support is impeccable, and the functionality gives you everything you need with an extremely easy and user-friendly interface! We've tried all of them, so we know what we're talking about."
This app is really good. loved the interface. the support team is really friendly. and this app is cheap compared to others.
"I just installed this app on my store, but am thrilled with the customer service that I have so far received from the Omega team. The tracking interface is just superb and I like it. Keep it up guys!"
"Great app, intuitive user interface, cool personnalisation options, excellent customer service and quick support !"
The cheapest and the cutest I've seen so far. I hope it gets better and better! The rest of the order tracking apps offer smaller quantity and not a good interface
Stella is very helpful and great! The app is easy to use and the interface is nicer than other apps I have used out there!!
The app is great. it helped me to solve the tracking order problem well. nice friendly interface. very nice. I recommend everyone to use it.
"I was comparing this app to Plugin SEO and I chose this app because of it's price, pretier interface and image compression capabilities...but then everything went wrong.
First off: I couldn't connect my google search console account -> my website url wasn't the same in my dashboard as in my google search account. To change that url, I had to click on a tiny ""show more""-like text wen I was in the settings menu. Not very straightforward but atleast I got it working right? No...
Second: This is the biggest issue of the app: It's NOT AT ALL optimized. It's SUPER SLOW. The interface loads quick, but the real useful buttons of the page take ages to load. Take for instance the image compression tab. Not only can't you not view more than 10 images per page. The actual ""compress"" button takes about 20-30 seconds to load after all the images of that page have loaded. After you've pressed that button, there's no feedback to let you know that it actually reduced the size of the image and not only changed the text from ""compress"" to ""uncompress"". The only thing I got it for, image compression, doesn't even work efficiently.
Adding to this point is the fact that app makes about 3-4 sitemaps for each sort of page: page, blog posts, product page, website pages. That's 2 sitemaps too many and it doesn't even submit them properly. About 40 links in my product sitemap are still missing in my search console...
Third: Yes it got worse...I wanted to check in on my app to see if it managed to completely submit my sitemap...It had crashed completely, giving me a 503 error. I tried accessing it via the icognito modus where no apps are installed...still a 503 error.
Conclusion: good app to edit your meta tags, but definitely not worth the $14.99/month price tag. Only 2 stars because their service is decent and had a lot of patience when I couldn't figure out how to change the website url in the settings, but still lacking the fluidity and ease of use of other apps."
This is the one Essential App you need if you are serious about boosting your organic rankings. It works and is easy to manage. The people behind SEO Doctor are constantly looking at ways to improve its functionality and user experience. Also they are very responsive to questions. Excellent online training for using the App. If I could give it 6 stars I would. www.dealsking.com.au
"Solid app and excellent user interface, what took hours to do now takes minutes. Worth every dollar."
"Amazing App with simple and easy to follow interface. I use it both for Google and Bing. Once you set up the feed correctly it is hands off. However, it requires an initial set up and the facebook part not ready, yet."
"I have tried soooo many inventory apps with no success. I was looking for something simple - like only inventory! - something that interfaces with my Shopify website, and it possible, could separate my locations, all at a reasonable price!! WOW and guess what - here it is. I was able to train my clerks in less than 15 minutes. We are still learning some of the finer points, but we are up and running. This is a GREAT app!!!!"
"App works well and the support was fantastic! Interface was straight forward and very user friendly too! All good, highly recommended!"
worst customer service I have encountered in a long time it takes days generally 3-4 to get a problem fixed. and that is not good enough when you need to ship a package. a 4 day lag in shipping is likely to start giving my great customer service reviews a bad rating. rates are good interface is easy but that customer service makes me so frustrated every time. I'm going back to sendle they are much better and have good customer support.
"As a software platform, Shippit has excelled all other shipping platforms we have used for our small business. The shipping rates have improved for our customers, we have less abandoned checkouts, and our online sales increased by more than 100% in one month - all thanks to switching to Shippit!
I have not found any interface more simple and time-saving than Shippit. Selecting from your saved ctn types or creating a new one, to printing out labels - it's an absolute breeze. Everything is very smooth and logical. The support we have received has been great too - a real person, with quick response time! All they need now is a courier to compete with their Couriers Please and Fastway services!"
We tried a couple of other solutions after launching but after getting really frustrated with them we decided to take a chance on Shippit. Setup was easy and a breeze compared to the others. The interface is clean and easy to understand and getting access to a variety of courier rates with corresponding timeframes is invaluable. The chat feature is also fantastic. We ran into a couple of issues initially in relation to courier timings and the customer service team were very helpful and patient with all our questions.
"We moved to Shippit from an in-house system that integrated with Australia Post via a CSV upload which was hard coded and inflexible. Shippit 's downgrader will save us a substational amount in shipping costs this year and we have so much more control and visibility over orders.
We like the simple interface with just a few tabs that are easy to understand and come to grips with quickly when there are hundreds of orders in the system all at different stages. Our customers also receive very high-quality information and in a timely manner.
We would highly recommend it!"
"Was excited at first...very salesy interactions and onboarding. Was very expensive for what you could accomplish on your own with your own e-mail service and retargeting app. I was expecting more interaction and hands-on work from your 'account manager'.  After a very simple 'onboarding' you are left to the races was a relatively clunky interface and a once-a-quarter call that isn't really useful. Towards the end, this call was forgotten about and my ""once-a-month"" free email had typos.  
Everyone I interacted with was nice though, so that was ok. A good group of people, but quite honestly not worth the high price-point. Especially for smaller businesses."
I can't say enough good things about Nick Hardy and his onboarding help.  Springbot is lucky to have him.  I found the interface intuitive.  I've used a lot of mail providers and Springbot was the easiest for me.  I did eventually move to an agency because I need to run my business and not worry about sending emails.
"I've been using Springbot for quite a while now (since the MailChimp debacle).  I was promised that they would be a ""partner"" in my marketing efforts.  This isn't the case.  It's just an app.  I get an email once in a blue moon with a suggestion here and there.  Not much of a ""partner"".
They changed the interface for their email creation.  It is very difficult to use.
I opted to let them manage my Facebook Ads as well.  MISTAKE.  My rep just up and left without notice.  Emails went unanswered, which was infuriating.  No communication.  I just out of the blue get an email from my new FB ads rep.  No explanation.
Speaking of FB ads.  I went through all of the ones that Springbot created, and found 1/2 of them not pointing to my Instagram page and were using the wrong pixel.  It was using an inactive one.  FOR 3 MONTHS.
I'm dropping them like a hot rock.  The service is NOT worth the monthly fee. 
I'm really tired of Shopify Partners screwing me out of my hard earned money."
"Overview: Best external link app out there (I tried ""Affiliatify ‑ External Links"" not as good)
Goods:
- best/fast costumer service
- can toggle external links on and off fairly easily
Bads:
- app interface/navigation needs improvements.
Improvements:
It is a bit weird to get  actually add your external link products.  You have to go to the ""Bulk Editor/Via Search."" You can edit product links in the home tab, but only  1 at a time.  
It's a bit confusing.  The ""home"" tab should be the same as the ""bulk editor.""  
Customer service experience:
1st ISSUE (resolved):
At first I set up my links and it did not work at all.   All my products had no button whatsoever,  their product pages were just blank. 
- BUT, I contacted customer service, they fixed my code for me, and they were fast (within the hour).  App works great now.
2nd ISSUE:
My dynamic checkout button is missing for my main product.  I am not sure if its due to the ""Outlink"" itself or but I have contacted the customer service and I will update my review when they respond."
Horrible interface. Our customers are so confused when they're making exchanges. We've given the team feedback (even a Stanford professor complained about their interface) and they have not made any changes. Their support team is even worse!
This app offers a lot of customization and has one of the best user interfaces of all page builder apps I've tried. They're customer service is above and beyond. They're all very helpful and quickly assist with coding and formatting. Special thanks to Caroline from their support team!
Very easy to use interface and most incredible customer support!! You can live chat with them and they are super helpful in answering any questions or resolving and issues you might have!!
Great customer support and easy to use! It takes no time to get used to the interface and functions.
"Amazing app, great assistance! suggested! it's very easy to create amazing pages, with a very good user experience quality!"
"This app offers a great variety of choice regarding how you would like to indicate your product's sold units and inventory units on the frontend. It has a simplistic, neat interface that's easy to interact with.
It allows us to customize the remaining stock information to be shown only when the inventory is lower than a certain number of units that's defined by us.
We can also ask the app to generate a fake number of remaining or sold units and we are allowed to set the lower and upper limits. In short, HeyMerch Sales & Stock Counter is a great app we would recommend any Shopify store whether fresh built or not, in order to build social proof and drive sense of urgency."
We've been using Recently 3 for just over a week and have already had good success. The app interface is intuitive to use and the real time analytics are great.  The best thing so far has been my interaction with the app developers. Their response time via email and in-app chat is amazing and they are receptive to feature requests. Highly recommended!
"Love the variety of products to choose from! Plus, The app is useful and the interface is easy to explore."
"I have a lot of mixed feelings about Teelaunch and I would love to see them improve their interface, as they seem to really care about their customers, but I must choose to go elsewhere after over 20 hours of tweaking my collection and having to start again from scratch. I just realized today, when I was ready to launch, that their interface has a glitch that will alter design sizes (please read below) when you are creating multiple garments using the same design/file.
The good:
- Customer support is amazing. A girl named Kristy answered my questions in 5 minutes or less during business hours. I had some questions about resolution and Dave was helpful and even recorded a video showing me how to fix my problem.
- When you upload one design, you can create many different types of t-shirts (unlike Printful, where you need to create each piece individually). This should be basic on every POD. I don't understand having to upload the same image on every. single. t-shirt.
What I'd love to see changed:
- Many times when you finish to place your design and you hit ""Create"", the interface bugs and you need to start from scratch.
- Many time while you're adjusting your design on a piece (let's say on a t-shirt), the interface changes the size on other pieces as well (that was the last drop for me).
- There are only three options of moving your design on a garment.  This means you need to create a single individual size for each product, except for t-shirts. 
- Automatically their interface will cut down your design where it has transparent areas. The problem about this is that, for example, if your design is too close to the neck, as you only have 3 pre-determined options of placement on the t-shirt (no dragging), you need to reopen your design on Illustrator, create an invisible pixel on it so it doesn't get trimmed by their interface, export and upload it again. It's annoying because sometimes it looks great on a Hoodie but it looks bad on a Baby's Bodysuit.
- The info of the products and titles DO NOT go automatically to the description, which I find to be really time-consuming. This means you need to copy it individually from their website (or uploading area) and paste them individually on each product. I ended up downloading a bulk editor.
- The measurement of clothing come only on a single PDF, so you have to navigate through it, find the garments you are working with and then type them down manually, as you cannot just copy and paste them on a chart.
I have tried all PODs that have reviews above 4 and I understand no POD will be perfect, but at this point, I was going to have to redo my entire collection as I just noticed the interfacing changing my design sizes continuously.
I loved their customer support and I do hope they improve these issues that make it really hard to work around despite my best efforts (such as creating invisible pixels, typing down all measurements manually, using an external bulk editor. If they do, I'd be happy to revisit my review and their interface."
"Tried out 3 different Shopify apps for my store (1) Notify, (2) This one - Recently, and (3) Recent Sales Notification Popup, and Recently came out tops! Using it permanently on my store now. I didn't want to spam my visitors with these popups, so any app I chose HAD to have a feature to limit the number of notifications it showed.
It had a good balance of price and features. Best of all, the customer service I received from Asa was simply amazing, turn around on replies were less than a day. He made customisations to shorten the state name, and optimised the mobile view all within a space of 3 days. *huge thumbs up*
Quick summary and ranking of the ones I've tried:
1) Recently - $10/month, lots of customisation options and has the ability to limit the number of notifications based on time of order.
2) Recent Sales Notification Popup - $5.95/month, lacked the feature to limit the number of notifications a user receives but it's the cheapest option.
3) Notify - way too expensive at $15/month, clean interface but lacks customisation options."
"I've been using Teelaunch exclusively for about a year with a 1000% satisfaction rate. I chose them initially for a number of reasons, the primary one being their easy-to-use interface. I've seen over time that their tech support and customer service are consistently fast, accurate and on target. 
In all the hundreds of products sold in all my stores, I have never had one complaint about quality or timeliness of delivery. In fact, people go out of their way to compliment the quality.
In all my 45 years of being in business, I rarely have seen such a well-run company so my hats off to Mr. Hamze and the rest of the staff. I didn't need much hand-holding because their interface is so easy to use, but it was there in case I wanted it. Their integration with Shopify is also exemplary. And I appreciate that they batch orders 6 times per day which makes my bookkeeping and accounting much easier!
As I go forward with more stores, I hope nothing changes with Teelaunch!

"Excellent app, quick interface would highly recommend."
"A Sra Yen sempre me ajuda no que preciso, instalei o app gratuitamente, recebo suporte imediato, o suporte faz alterações na minha página em tempo real, caso seus review não estejam aparecendo, ou tenham interferido na interface do seu produto, eles são capazes de fazer todos os ajustes, se você fornecer pra eles apênas a url do seu site"
Like it very much. Very easy to use. Clean interface.
Exceptional Onboarding Experience! I'm hesitant to onboard any new platforms given the overhead and this was smooth and simple - highly recommend. Clearly they take user experience and design very seriously and it's impressive.
Estimated Shipping is fantastic. Easy integration + easy to use interface!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Nice features and interface, but you need to pay for each unique set of tabs on your site.  Overall very nice if you need just one set of tabs."
"Hi,
to be honest, never experienced such a good support from these guys. I tried stamped.io beforehand and their support was so bad that I decided to stop working with stamped.io. Thex actually didnt respond within 48h! Only when I cancelled I recieved feedback. The guys from proview usually respond within cpuple of hours. The interface and the options are not as good as for e.g. from stamped.io but they are working on it to make the app better. The value money ratio you get is 1000x better than with stamped.io. Definielty a GO for Proview!"
"I've worked with Simprosys for a long time. Their customer service is knowledgeable and eager to help. This review app has a lot of cool features. I like the user interface, especially the layout of reviews and questions, on my website. The app is easy to use and has many features, such as displaying a review carousel, generating coupon codes, review drawer, and so on. Simprosys also develops websites, so they really understand the nuts and bolts of Shopify."
Easy to manage with good backend user experience as compare to other apps. Super Support with quick response to your queries. Highly recommended app.
"I don't normally feel compelled to write comments. But, and this is a big but, Pixel Union is second to none, I use their themes, their pop ups and others on my e-commerce store. World-class user experience is half of what they stand for, the other half is how stylish yet supportive their features are. Use it and see it for yourself. Again, these guys are really, really good at what they do. Good Luck!"
"Great app, easy to use, and nice interface. I have on all 3 of my shopify stores. Support is very good, Andrea is very quick to respond and sort any issues. Very happy with product, and I am capturing alot of emails."
A simple interface makes this easy to use. The customization is limited but also flexible enough to style with your brand. Engages customers and increases sales. Support is responsive and helpful. A great value.
This app has been great to work with! Their support is fantastic and extremely responsive to our requests and customizations. The interface is user friendly and has great analytics already built into the app.
top et facile vient de l'installer je dois encore faire les reglages et on verra ce que ca donne interface ok
Great user interface! Super easy to use & troubleshoot.
"great support and easy to use app, i like the fuctionality and user friendly interface !!! thanks for the great app :)"
This is a great app. Their customer support is awesome and they reply super fast. Paul is always very helpful. The user interface is very nice.
"Absolutely Fantastic app! I can say this is must have app for dropship. Great customer support and easy-to-use interface has helped me a lot. Very useful, anyone can use it for dealing with dropshipping. Thanks CC Fashion for this very responsive dropship app :) :)"
"Tried a few back in stock notify me apps. 1. Previous app slowed ut down, not this one!
2. Nice layout of the user interface, so easy to use and to customise.
3. Integrates with Klaviyo and many others is also a big plus
4. Placement of the button inline by customer support was done better and faster than the other app. So what can I say more? I am more than happy!"
"Fantastic app. I've been using another Digital Downloads app for a couple of years and after finally getting fed up with poor service, server outages over weekends, missing download emails and the inability to post a download link to the order confirmation page, I finally made the switch to SendOwl. 3 days later I can honestly say it's the best decision I've made with regard to my store. 
I initially had a few issues with installing to my custom template but the SendOwl team were incredibly helpful and got me up and running quickly with tailored instructions.
The easy to use interface makes the app a dream to use and almost guarantees you'll never receive a ""where's my download link"" email from a customer ever again. 
Highly recommended."
"I tried Dinosell because it was the cheapest (well, free) app for reconverting customers after they checkout. It was pretty good but I didn't like the branding, so I went to a different app. Oh boy, the other app was terrible user experience and support. So I came back to Dinosell and asked if branding could be removed. Anand from Dinosell removed it in seconds after I asked, and now the checkout experience looks absolutely amazing. My favourite part is the little confetti! Thanks team. Definitely sticking with you guys now."
"So happy I found this app. Had tried about 5 or 6 and was starting to lose hope. Works great and the support is the best I have come across. I now use it across multiple stores. Initially, maybe not the easiest to use interface but once you get used to it and learn the functionality it's fine."
"First off, we LOVE this app. 
we have 3,000+ products and we needed highly customizable and conditional options for our web-store to take us to the next level. after trying a dozen other with tons of good reviews that were cheaper, they didn't come close to our needs and were clumbsy.
we were a bit hesitant with the higher price, BUT it has exceeded all expectations.
support is fantastic! they respond to every request within a day and have made several accommodations to make things easier to setup.
it is an intimidating interface with all the options and templates but it works beautifully!
another big plus is it does NOT leave permanent hidden products in your store (many other options apps do)
we have the ultimate plan which and use every bit of it
conditional logic, pricing formulas, mass actions. (most other apps don't have these features)
it seems 5 stars are given out too easily these days
but this one deserves MORE than 5 stars
LOVE it"
"This app is amazing! For me bots was a word that meant difficulty and complications and thanks to gobot I discovered how easy it could be To build one because of their intuitive interface and how they help you reach more sales and revenue! 
When you start your company the amount of work is overwhelming and you have to be an all in one worker, and believe me Gobot can relief you a lot of work! Definitely will continue working with them!"
"The app has a friendly interface, setting up was easy and BON customer support (Daisy) was extremely helpful with resolving the issues i had."
"Without the software of Itoris and their excellent support my store would not be functional and I would be forced to hire external developers. The cost/benefit factor is incredible. Since I'm not a developer, the interface looked a bit old-fashioned at first, but it's the only application that actually works as described and with their support even beyond that. I am a very happy customer and can highly recommend Itoris."
"Really good customization app. Has been able to achieve everything we need and support tickets are responded to usually the same day. 
It is a bit tricky to get used to the user interface but after a bit of playing around any computer adept store owner should be able to figure out the basics. This app supports custom HTML elements in the product options, making it possible to customize it any way you like. 
All of the custom pricing works perfectly and IT ACTUALLY WORKS unlike all of the other product options apps. It's very fast to load, even on mobile devices.
So far the app has had 100% uptime and only a few minor glitches when they are optimizing the app code, if you encounter any glitches the support team will help you right away.
A very good app for the money."
"Excellent app, and I literally tried every single product option app that allowed price changes!  This one is newer so doesn't have as many reviews, but I'm glad I didn't let that stop me.  In my opinion, this is by far the best app out there for options!
I had 2 questions and both were responded to very quickly.  The 2nd questions was a bit more ""custom"" and they made the changes required and let me know what was done.
The reasons I love this app compared to the others in the app store:
1. Dependent options work really well and are intuitive to use.  I have a lot of options that depend on the quantity ordered and the prices increase as larger sets are ordered.  This app handles the pricing perfectly.   Also nice that you can make options hidden at a very detailed level, so you can keep you product page looking ""clean"" and options reveal themselves as other options are chosen.  
2. The interface makes sense when setting up options, but I am fairly computer savvy.  I think someone relatively new might be overwhelmed a bit because of all the choices, but that's what makes this app so flexible.  The documentation was well written and, again, if you have a questions you could just ask through the app (it has a support tab right in the app where you can track your tickets).
3. This app adds variants to the product when a customer adds the product to their carts, which is amazing!  Another bonus to this app is that since the variants are added to the products automatically, all discounts or coupons work perfectly!  **OTHER APPS add cloned products to your store so your product admin becomes bogged down in clones.  With the OTHER APPS using cloned ""hidden"" products, the sale would only affect the original item and the options wouldn't show the discount.  There was a complicated workaround with those other apps to make it work, but definitely not ideal.**   SO, this app is amazing, all discounts worked perfectly right out of the gate and no extra products bogging down your admin.
4. This app seems to load a bit quicker than the other app I nearly kept too, and has a little animated icon to show when it's loading and when it's adding to the cart, so the customer can see what's going on and doesn't have to wait long on the product page.
5. Styling the options is one of the coolest features!  Another app I used let you upload image swatches, but even adding my own custom css, I couldn't get different option images to show up as different sizes.  THIS app has css areas built right into each option so you can adjust the image size per each type of option - genius!  This is an advanced feature and you will need to know css to do this - it's code and not something a beginner would know, but could be researched online or asked about in a ticket if all else fails.  So now for my address stamps, for example, I have my main image options in the largest size, my secondary options (that are hidden and depending on the 1st option chosen) in a medium size so they fit all on one row on the product page once revealed, and then my ink color swatches are in a much smaller size.  No other app had this functionality.
6. Options are editable in the cart and the popup looks just like your product page options, so it's a good interface for the customer.
7. The option templates are amazing! I can create a template and apply that to many products at once, so if I ever need to edit the options, I can just edit the template and all products will update.  I do wish this feature was included in the $19 plan instead of the $29 plan since I don't need any of the other $29 options and other apps include this at the lower level, BUT since I love the app function so much, I'm willing to pay the extra upgrade."
"In one word - this app is GENIUS! If you are looking for a smart chatbot with an excellent user experience and all-in features, look no further. The set-up was extremely easy, super fast and has great short tutorials to guide you through. When I needed help with something, Max was so amazing and answered very quickly with great support! :) This is probably my favorite app on shopify by far. I wish there were more than 5 stars to give! ;) THANK YOU SO MUCH for this tremendous app!"
"I am really really amazed.
GoBot has so much to offer and the user interface is so ridiciouls easy to use and designed with top notch up to date design, super user friendly.
The idea behind this fastinates me even more. This Shopify App is going to change the whole game of marketing.
With GoBot you are literally able to make your store more interactive, engaging and a lot more personal to your customer.
And we all know getting personal relationship with your customers is key for big long-term success.
There is looooots of possibilities you can do.
All your static headlines and everything that is static and serves to make the customer buy can be replaced now with GoBot to make it feel a lot more real and a lot more personal and engaging.
It is really amazing what you can do with it.
All stores are going to be a lot more cooler."
Awesome app. Customizable interface is really cool. Wish it was free 4ever.
"This quarter, we had fun participating in the beta test of Gobot.
[No. Not the transforming robot Tonka toys from the 80's. lol]
Gobot is a slick bot app you can add to your Shopify estore to automatically solicit email addresses, automate your customer service, schedule meetings, and present social shares/likes/follows, polls, conversational forms/surveys, gifs, videos, images, and lots more.
And here's the kicker ... NO CODE!
Yep. You read that right. You don't need to write a single line of code to make Gobot bots transform your Shopify estore into an interactive marketing machine your visitors will love.
We tested on our Shopify landing pages, collections pages, products pages, and even our terms of services page which is actually a special 'page' created by yet another awesome Shopify app -- (Help Center by Vertex LV).
We found the Shopify Gobot app easy to install and the Gobot interface intuitive to use. We literally had 2 custom bots up and running on our site within minutes. And when we needed help triggering one of our Gobot bots on that special page (mentioned above), the Gobot developer actually called us personally. [mind = blown]
Solid Shopify bot app with excellent support, a growing community of custom bot builders, tons of features and tons more to come. Great job guys ... 5 stars."
"I love chatbots, and Gobot makes it very easy to integrate on into  your store. The user interface is excellent - customizing your chatbot is simple. The templates they provide are great. I compared this to another Shopify chatbot app that I won't name, and Gobot is the clear winner."
"I have been using this app for a while and it is perfect. The interface and handling is easy. Not to mention the responsive and attentive customer support. Thanks again to the developers, Daisy and of course the whole team."
"Love the interface - a great choice if you have a vibrant page. Great tools and options, straightforward. Once you get your head round it, easy to set up. Special thanks to Dale who was lovely and helped me with a few minor queries!"
"Great app with all the free features, and the coolest thing on top of that is the translation feature which is not available on many other apps, you can customize your interface however you want. The rewards program is great and offers many features. I let you discover it on my website. emdoria.com. All my gratitude to the team. Emile answered me faster and as I expected. Very nice concept and I hope it will stay free for a long time."
"Super produits, service réactif pour répondre à vos questions, interface simple et intégration ultra simple. Je conseil Tpop les yeux fermé"
"Je débute sur Shopify et T-POP et je trouve l'interface très pratiques, et surtout le ton employé très original. J'ai hâte de finaliser mes produits !"
"Excellent print on demand products with very easy to use design interface and dashboard. Quality of the garments is excellent and I have had no issues with the quality of the printing. Products are produced within a reasonably quick timeframe and dispatched with registered post. Factory is based in Paris, France so would highly recommend for European Union based stores. Packaging is high quality and allows you to use your own store's branding which allows you to reinforce your brands awareness."
"Quick response from the support team to help me make some minor adjustments to the filter. User interface is also very easy to use, much better than other apps I tried."
"THE APP:
I’ve used the app for a little bit now, but I fell in love the first 5min of using it. Super easy to use dashboard, simple interface, no nonsense THE SUPPORT:
The support team is awesome, had a little problem with a filter in my theme, Asked for support via the app Dashboard. I got almost instant a response, super friendly & helpful the problem was resolved within 30min since my first email! That’s what I call support
I’ve been helped by Helen, definitely one of my best experiences with customer support ever. I’m a returning customer for sure,
Keep up the good work!"
"Une équipe à l'écoute, réactive, très sympathique et engagée ! Un catalogue produits de qualité, des délais respectés. L'interface est également très intuitive. Bref, un atelier français et partenaire qui mérite largement 5 étoiles !"
J'aime beaucoup T-pop pour les produits de qualité et les valeurs éthiques qu'ils respectent. L'interface est très intuitive vraiment facile d'utilisation. Et l'équipe est toujours disponible pour répondre aux questions!!! 5 étoiles méritées
A cart recovery tool is a must and this app is easy to install and the interface is very clean and user friendly.
"Excellente application. Beaucoup de nouveautés dernièrement. J'attends de voir avec impatience comment cela va évoluer une fois que la nouvelle interface sera stabilisée. Pour ce qui est des produits, ils sont de très bonnes qualités et les impressions sont parfaites. Les délais sont très raisonnables, pour le moment, rien à redire."
I like the interface and easy to print shirts. The support docs is helpful and very extensive and help pretty on time.
I found this app very uselful and its not hard to use at all. Im new to shopify and really like the interface and features.
Easy to use with a clean interface. It has helped me improve my store so much! I'm excited to make more sales :)
"The app is easy to use, and the interface is relatively simple and not complicated. The technicians are also very enthusiastic and the reply is very prompt."
"The app has a very clean easy to understand interface. Not confusing and not complicated at all. The support is amazing, fast efficient, and to the point! They setup all the widgets, answered all my questions and had a conversation with me on and off for 2 hours."
"I have installed this app and as far as i can see, every single feature is working smoothy without any bug. the interface also is amazing and easy to understand. we will keep using this app and try to see if it can increase the sales at our store."
"This app is the worst. We use the free version. If the free version is not good, why would I want to upgrade??? The 'triggered' emails to customers are impossible to edit. When you click 'save' changes, the page just loads for forever. It never works. Customers complain all the time about the interface. Customers complain about not knowing where the code is. Customers want to unsubscribe from emails. It's a mess. I've talked to Rogello at support and he is just plain and simple incompetent. I never receive a support ticket email. Nothing gets fixed. He says I should ""try a different browser and computer"". I did and experience the same problems. What they need is for Yotpo to actually get involved with their expertise and improve this product, support from top to bottom. WASTE OF MY TIME."
This is the best dropshipping app! prompt service and easy to use interface. really easy to migrate and fast fulfillment
"I used this app for creating auto discounts and managing different kinds of discounts on my store. Very easy to use, Neat Interface, functionality, design, etc. The support team also took my feedback. Although, I'm waiting for the feature requested to be added."
"The user experience is seamless, effortless, and enjoyable. It definitely gets the job done. Would recommend it."
"Topdser has a user interface that is far superior to all other tools that are currently out there. The user experience is seamless, effortless, and enjoyable. Highly recommend."
"I used this app to help me do product import on my Shopify store. I like how it does bulk product import, and it has a great user interface."
A fantastic app! Just recommend it! I have it in my shop and it runs just great. Good customer support and a great interface.
"This app has worked really great for me, and the whole interface is just clean. I would definitely recommend Topdser."
"I installed this app after trying several Dropshipping apps, and nothing to say this app really gives the best user experience, from targeting products in the US to importing products to the store with all the necessary rules, highly recommend the app as well as the professional service"
"Using silver version. Good loyalty program that we use extensively with our customer base. We reward points for account registration, purchases, social media likes/follows, and reviews (through integration with Judge.me). We also reward discount coupons for newsletter signups. Support (Rogelio and others) has been very good. Needs more flexibility in customer search (currently email only, not by name), better mobile/phone interface (horrible on android), and more flexible or intermediate cost plans (very expensive to get just a few more features we'd like such as Mailchimp direct integration). IMPORTANT - does not support double opt-in for new newsletter subscribers - we'll be looking for an alternative app for that. Overall satisfied."
"Absolutely awesome app, very glad to have found it. Great user interface and layout, easy to use and customize exactly how you want. Highly recommended!"
Great simple app. Easy to get a good looking pricing table up and running. Used a few other pricing table apps and found this one to have the nicest interface and features.
"It looks really good and the interface is slick. However, seems very buggy still - the widgets designed do not render as shown in the interface, also slow to render. Have contacted support and are waiting for a fix..."
"This app actually comes with a feature-rich user interface, making it much more useful than the others. I am yet to find any problem. There's just one feature I need that would require me to upgrade."
Globo Request a Quote is a very useful tool for our B2B marketing especially the design of quote cart. Thanks much for Emma and her team's  help for customizing the interface.
Globo customer service is amazing to work with. They are responsive and always available. We are currently using 2 of the apps and are very happy. This organizes the quotes for us and gets the job done very simply. Its visual interface is simple and easy to figure out for the customer.
"The best translation app I have found. Simple interface, exceptional assistance. They are always ready to answer any questions or doubt. They are always online in chat to assist us. Thanks from Dedè Couture staff. Thanks to Max who assisted us from start to finish. www.dedecouture.com"
"Himanshu
Was able to solve several issues with my setup and interface to QBO ....
Especially concerning collecting sales taxes and importing transactions that included the sales taxes ... was handled expertly ! ... thank you."
"This app is a saviour. Tagging is cumbersome, and performing large data consolidation and cleaning up the tags is momentous when your products are in the thousands.
This app  sets the standard on how to perform bulk operations in Shopify and how to work with the tagging system intelligently. 
Tag consolidation is easy. Tag clean up = easy. 
Tasks that could require hours upon hours of manual data correction within the native Shopify interface can be done simply and easily with this tool."
"I used this app to translate my English site to Chinese. Simple interface, very easy to use. A plus point to the excellent support team!"
This app is a great tool for international stores. Integrates really fast and the interface is smooth and clear. Much better than the standard import/export CSV Shopify procedure.
"This is by far the best language app for shopify users. Whether on the desktop browser or phone, it is crisp and clear. I would highly recommend doing one of the paid plans. As to the translation quality - because currently I invest in the AI translator I cannot be sure, but for me at this present time it fits perfectly because at least in the future if funds allow I can use this same app to manually input the translations as and when I get them. But here is the real kick for this app.....the support is top class. Quick, efficient, polite and 100% solid. Because the app requires a bit of work on the users part for set up and checking, it is great that you can contact support for the tricky parts and resolutions if something does not look right. I must also commend them and shopify on the theme interface . I am using a Shopify 2.0 theme and the ability to manipulate the positioning of the language dropdown list is incredibly valuable. Support were super sharp to customise for me upon request. One can sometimes mistakenly assume that because it looks right on the desktop it will automatically look right on the phone, but this may not be the case. The theme customising dashboard however allows you to play with it very quickly and see the results in screen until you are 100% happy with the position of the language dropdown list and flags (if selected) for desktop and phone. I am extremely happy with this app and for sure one of the best overall on Shopify."
"I switched over from a competitor review platform app and couldn't be more happy with the decision! Okendo is easy to use, customer service is FAST and tailored (unlike the competitor, who always had copy paste answers and solutions for us), and I love the interface and customization capabilities."
"Our new store is here! This is our first application review. Hope our comments can make the Shopify community better. PRO
1 The Social King app is a very good idea for our store. Our store is based on the cooperative sharing economy model, and the social functions of our store are urgently needed
2 This application completes the work of establishing a user-based community with a certain degree of flexibility and basic social functions for us.
3 Simple interface and easy to use
4 Easily set up by using some setting options
5 Excellent customer services, we always get answers to our questions from the application team. CON
1 In contrast, this app offers fewer editing options (without editing code) compared to most other apps we use in the Shopify App Store.
2 The interface is simple, but somehow it lacks some basic logic and functions of social media. For example, your own login user page provides limited functions, and the application program interface has consistency issues between various parts...
3 Some interface problems of PC version and mobile version. In particular, promotional products cannot be displayed correctly on mobile devices. This shouldn't happen. In addition, our store theme applies to all other applications we are using, but the same settings do not apply to this application, for example, text colors, hyperlinks colors...
4 Loading speed, because the community (application section) homepage loads it significantly slower than all other pages in our store. Not sure if this is an issue with the app, but the slow loading of the community homepage has been happening in our store. Why is it five-star? This will come from the customer service of the app, which is well-deserved. We hope our review is helpful to you, and hope to see more features and simple editing settings from Social King or other applications working in the same area."
The team is amazing. They helped us with seamless migration across from another review software. The interface is also really easy to use. Highly recommend!
"Metafields are a Shopify secret weapon. Don't tell anyone. I have been using Metafields Editor for quite some time now at mommymakeup.com, and the app keeps getting better. Super happy with the interface and reliability. I can count on this app to not mangle my data (unlike another app that I used prior). 5-stars."
The customer support from this app was instrumental to building our local delivery options. Sreeman was particularly helpful in providing guidance over Zoom and ensuring that the options and payment processes were set up properly with a seamless user experience. Would highly recommend this app for the instant chat support and fast customer service.
"This is the #1 time-saving app I use for my Shopify store, and is a must-have app for any serious store owner.  This app does one thing, and does it very well.  It's elegant simplicity and robust PDF purchase orders can save you hours each week manually creating POs to your fulfillment vendors - right from your orders.  This is the only Shopify app I've found that will allow you to create detailed, signed POs with customized Notes and line items, and provides an email interface to provide further directions to your vendors. 
Easy install and the support has been fantastic!
If I could rate it 10 stars, I definitely would!"
"Best customer service ive ever received on an app. On top of that, the app interface for frontend and backend is so good. Definitely highly recommended."
"Great app, easy to install and use. My developer recommended it and it's helped us personalise our user experience on our site www.thepowerofme.co.uk. If you're needing some bespoke meta fields this is the app you should use."
"I installed and played with seven or eight referral system apps before narrowing it down to Ekoma. Of the apps I investigated, Ekoma has both the most functionality and best (most intuitive) backend interface. It also has the best end-user interface. The app's pricing seems very reasonable to me and is more affordable than many of the referral system apps out there. The support has also been excellent. Keep up the great work, devs at Ekoma!"
"Out of all apps I have used (and I use many), this one is the most impressive! Criminally underappreciated, honestly.
At first I was hesitant because I thought ""why would I spend a monthly sum of $10 just for a simple app that changes the variant image selector and then sits there passively?""
Well, holy f***ing s***balls, when I downloaded it, I was absolutely blown away. Not only are the amount of options surprisingly large, but the whole image selector and zoom interface is so extensive and amazingly put together, the $10 quickly became nothing in my mind.
Apps with less than half the work put in are more expensive than this. No joke, the other day I found a product sale label app for $19 monthly and I still had to do half the coding work to integrate it! 
Thank you for your awesome work!"
"The app works great. We primarily wanted it for the variant image assignment, but the gallery also really cleaned up the look on the site. 
One of the other great things it did is sped up our load speed. Previously Shopify would load ALL of the images for ALL of the variants, but this app doesn't cause the images to be loaded until the variant is selected. We have products that have roughly 15 different options, and each product has 5 images so we were having to load 75 images everytime... so we had slow site load. Now our site load has improved.
The back end interface isn't the best, but I've been working with the team at Gravity and they've been very responsive already implementing some of my suggestions. Good developer, and worth the money IMO if you have variants."
"Easy interface, Fast and friendly costumer support, Work perfect. Used it for my halloween sale. Thanks"
"bad app, keeps loading multiple times even to users who have alrdy played! hurts website user experience and conversion rates drastically. maybe coz its a free app its neglecting basics?"
"The by Multiple Product Slider app by Enormapps has a very simple and user-friendly configuration interface.
The slider showcases my best selling products in an eye catching way so it's a great tool to bolster your store sales.
I was provided great and swift technical support when I requested for customized installation."
An amazing app for affiliate marketing! Have bounced over a couple of apps and decided to stick with Goaffpro for its ease of use and interface. Highly recommended!
"L'interface utilisateur de Teezily est simple mais manque encore d'un peu d'informations importantes, des défauts de jeunesse. Néanmoins, les tarifs sont compétitifs, les délais de livraison dans la moyenne.
En tout cas, le service client est plutôt réactif. Si il y a un petit défaut sur un t-shirt ou une commande en retard, ils n'hésitent pas à réexpédier un nouveau t-shirt.
Le service client m'a confié pas mal d'évolutions prochainement, c'est bon signe."
"We have a lot of repeat customers who want to make orders for several products at once, and this app makes that much process more streamlined for them. While there are aspects of the interface that could see improvement, the developer has been very responsive, and I expect this app to get even better. Reasonably priced, too."
"BEWARE. This app is poorly made. The interface is extremely outdated and several things do not work. They have a javascript error that conflicts with several themes and the order tracker will not show on your website. I experienced this and when I asked for a refund since I was on the paid plan, their customer service team ignored me. Any responses they give to this review is just for show. The app is horrible and the customer service is worse. I recommend the app AFTERSHIP instead of this. It's 100x better. You're welcome."
"Better than using Facebook Business to connect to your customers, much faster as the new FB interface is to slow to load, to much tracking code in facebook not only wanting to invade everyones privacy but also wanting to invade your business information. using this platform is very fast to load and gives me a barrier against FB privacy violations."
Messenger app does not work right for facebook other than that interface is okay. Could be improved but for a free app a really simple small business its fine
Finally! I have visibility of our web businesses feeding into Quickbooks without the ridiculous amount of work it took to splice and dice them all together manually and have to make adjustments on top of it all because of 3rd party apps that I no longer need. The set up is a bit lengthy but so worth every minute spent. The interface is extremely user friendly and just so happy with being able to see everything and have reporting to accounting be more seamless through quickbooks. This tool is a time saving magician and a life saver. Highly recommend!
Au top le Sav j'aime beaucoup l'interface de l'application qui me permet de beaucoup convertir et de proposer des offres très attrayantes
"Wide Bundle est un must have pour toute les boutiques souhaitant booster leur taux de conversion. L'interface est super simple à prendre en main, et en cas de questions sur le fonctionnement, où petits bugs, le support est à 100% à vos côtés."
"Pleasantly surprised. This is a really well thought out app that allows you to add some simple animations or advanced and complex animations with multiple layers. For something that is so powerful, the user interface is clean and polished."
The Interface for Settings and creation of attributes could be better. I would pay for it if it meant having a single point of creation and management for all the forms on my website than having to go to multiple apps for this.
"A great app that doubled my conversion rate! Very easy to get started, and a large choice of customization. Incredible customer support that strives to give you the best experience possible, listens to you and offers you the possibility to customize your interface to your liking. I really recommend it! :D"
"Poor user interface, not user intuitive. Application did not properly install. Placement of products flawed. Higher learning curve."
We are activaley using EPICA on our shopify store for a couple months now. We are very happy with the incredible on boarding and setup support from the EPICA team as they helped us to get the app up and running with great user experience. The widgets and search box is very easy to setup and will give your customer a great way to find the right product on your shop.
"Their communication is great! The application interface can be improved, but the current version does not create any obstacles."
"I primarily wanted this app for the mix and match features. The bundles are very customizable, and the visual design fits perfectly with my store theme. Just about every scenario you could think of is covered. The support team is also exceptional! Perhaps a few things with the customer-facing interface that could be improved, such as sticky widgets, but a minor thing given everything this app is capable of!"
"I had been searching for an app that would allow employees to create custom swag kits while managing inventory and preventing overuse of redemption codes. Bundle Builder helped me do this, while also presenting a clean and easy-to-use user experience. Great app!"
"Super useful app, adds a lot of value to the user experience! The support team is great and was able to help me as much as possible to make the app look seamless with the site. Highly recommend!"
"Cool app! I like the way it looks and feels on my website, very easy to use interface. I'd like to see how it works in the future :D"
"DO NOT USE THIS APP if you care about good user experience and good customer support! It is the biggest sales weekend of the year and this app keeps telling customers our items are sold out when we literally have hundreds in stock. Ads running, emails going and half the people are encountering errors. Have not heard back from their support and losing sales by the minute. Very upset. When it works its great but when it doesn't, you are outta luck. Very buggy. Take heed."
"Wholester has been a game changer for us! It was becoming very frustrating using shopifys basic store to manage our wholesale accounts. With wholester we are able to set up professional accounts for our stockists, add net 30 terms, ship to multiple locations in one order, and maintain any special notes we need for each unique client. The user experience from the front end is far superior to anything I've seen from Shopify's ordering system as well. Highly recommend!!"
"We are very pleased with Bundle Builder so far. We added the app a couple months ago to allow customers to build their own gift box by selecting different products in our store. When I had a question, Adam from customer service was very helpful!
I am hoping that they will add some more features soon that will enhance the user experience like being able to filter the products and maybe even a separate boxfor personalization notes (we offer a few products which can be personalized) similar to the ""gift note"" box. Other than that, great job guys! Happy to continue using this app."
"Update (Oct.2020): Unfortunately, I've been having a lot of issues with inventory inaccuracy, which I initially believed was human error, but then realized it's caused by this app. I wish I could try Multiple SKU to see if that solves the problem, but since coupons can't be used, that's not an option for us. Something to keep this in mind when installing this app, and possibly any other 3rd party app handling product inventory.
--- This app works great for allowing customers to build their custom bundles. The customer's interface is attractive and very user-friendly (it works in every browser, btw), it has a nice amount of features, and everything is well documented in their Support Documentation. Also, Adam O from their customer service is always helpful, friendly and responsive. Like with everything, some things could be improved. I'd love to see some options to filter products when building the bundle, like in BoxFox. And the way optional products are added and removed on the merchant side could be better, as it gets labor-intensive when you have many products. In general, I'm very happy with this app, and I hope they will continue making improvements. I can't wait for them to add subscriptions, hopefully keeping the zero commission policy. Thank you for the good work."
"So I played around with this app and even though it is very simple and nice interface to use, when making rules it will glitch a lot of times especially if you are trying to do FREE + Shipping Rules. Things like a shipping with a cost of $0.00 will appear beside the correct shipping option you intend your buyers to buy. If you decide to go with this app make sure to 4x check your work, your rules, go through the checkout and try different products, this will ensure you dig out different bugs and glitches. Now the staff can be helpful, but may be a little unresponsive at times but they are still good. I would recommend to use Master Shipping, as it is less faulty and little more simple (though at the beginning you can feel a little lost). Also it doesn't glitch out."
"The email options Privy offers are great! The text marketing product is a definite no!
We tried it for over a month. Our customer texts were sent after flash sales and offers were over, the text interface set up leaves a great deal to be desired....they offer no graphics or text options that pop for clients to take notice, like other marketing text services. Privy did refund our fee and was very nice to listen to the issues we experienced."
"Thanks for making this app. The interface is intuitive and the ability to completely customize bundles and layout is huge! We had an issue integrating an age-verification app with our product bundle pages, and the customer service team worked with us and the other app developers to resolve the issue. The Bundle Builder team was polite, responsive, and diligent in finding a solution that worked, and we're grateful for that. Thank you!"
We have been very happy with the interface with Quickbooks and Shopify. The customer service is fantastic. They help every time we have an issue. Highly recommend.
"I started using this app for daughter1's business around the start of December 2021 and within 10 minutes I was wishing I'd known about it earlier. It's a brilliant app: it seamlessly integrates Shopify with Australia Post Business so it uses the Shopify client address data to populate the address and other details on the label and once the labels are printed it fulfills the order, populates it with the tracking info and triggers the shipping confirmation email from Shopify. It runs from within Shopify, has a simple and intuitive interface and has lots of default settings that really simplify label printing. It allows you to edit the address and parcel size and weight and it even does some verification of the address e.g. suburb/postcode etc. I've been using it for four months and found it to be totally bug free. Support via online chat is excellent. Daughter2 has started using it for her business and she's of the same opinion, it's saving her shipping person heaps of time. If you use Shopify to ship stuff you should be using this app."
"The app is very effective and gets the job done, but the interface is very large, like you are zoomed in too far, which can make it difficult to use sometimes."
Great application. Easy to use and intuitive user interface. Fast customer support.
Till now everything ok. Maybe the interface could be improved to make the navigation easier and faster
"At this point in time this app is the best way for users of MyPost Business to quickly (and accurately) import label data into the service for label creation. The interface is really simple, easy to use but customisable to suit your store's needs. You'll have to jump back in to the MyPost Business on the web to pay for your labels but just about everything else can be handled in the app. We've tried a few and this is the best app for Australia Post MyPost Business. If you're creating less 5 labels a day, I'd stick to manually entering and save your cash. Anything more than that, this will save you a lot of time - highly recommended!"
It works fine and gets the job done but the pop ups looks pretty sloppy and the user interface isn't the easiest to use.
Thought it would be a daunting task to get my store geared up to ship internationally.This app has made things easy with a simple interface that is not complex.Excellent support from Vijay.
"Justuno is amazing! It integrates easily with Shopify Plus, and it's easy to build unique customer experiences with popups. Justuno is worth the time investment and has a positive ROI almost immediately. The targeting and analytics options, along with the A/B testing functionality, make it easy to determine what's working and where the opportunities are. The user interface definitely has a learning curve. I would recommend partnering with their Professional Services team to have an expert that can help move creative assets and testing opportunities through the system quickly. Justuno makes Lead Gen easy and has rapidly allowed us to build our Email and SMS lists by offering a personalized discount. It's one of the most important integrations to consider on Shopify Plus."
"Awful user interface - it takes way too much time to customize pop-ups relative to other design interfaces (Canva, Klaviyo, Shopify themes). It gets the job done but is too much of a hassle to set-up. We're switching to a native integration."
Great app to reduce image sizes and improve SEO. Easy to use interface. Perfect value for this free app.
"The app works okay. It probably could work better and have better interface, but it does what it supposed to do. Recently we experienced issue with the app and unfortunately realised how unprofessional developer's support is and slow to resolve a critical for business issues. Support was so unprofessional that we will be looking to replace the app."
This app works great and has an excellent and easy to learn user interface. Keep up the great work guys.
"The rates we pass onto our customers are amazing! We ship large packages that CP can't accommodate so we rely on couriers. The netparcel interface is easy to use and printing labels from their website is very easy. We have already recommended this app to other shopify businesses. Also, calls to tech support are answered quickly and with immediate solutions."
Nice. Looking good after installation. Will update on the user experience after a couple of weeks of use.
"I inherited the task of overseeing our shopify store with XPO shipping when an employee quit. It has been a learning curve. The XPO Logistics software interface works very well if all of the parameters are entered correctly. I think the software is sound and the customer support at Eniture is the best in the business. If all support people could be as prompt, knowledgeable, intuitive, helpful and kind as they are my life would be a lot easier. They are great!! The documentation on their product is also very helpful. It is obvious that they have addressed in great detail the problems that people encounter as they use the software. Cannot say enough about their good efforts."
I would highly recommend this app for those who do their own shipping and are sending packages to a variety of countries.  The postage rates are the best I've seen and have already saved us hundreds of dollars over the past month of using the service.  The interface is easy to use and set up.  It's very straight forward to import orders from Shopify.
"Very simple to use interface, great integration with Shopify.  It's also a great quotation engine for any of my other shipping needs, from parcels to LTL and more."
"Great app in terms of shipping protection, interface could use a boost and make it more user-friendly"
"Excellent service.  Fantastic rates, easy to use interface, seamless integration... what more do you need from a shipping app?"
Downloading and installing the app to my store was super easy. It has a clean interface and it's also nice for upsell. I like it
I like the user friendly UI interface of the app. Very easy to figure my way around with no stress.
"It's really easy to use this app, the interface is very user-friendly and very prompt customer support, always there to help you. Highly recommend this to anyone."
"Heads up, this is the best exporter bang for your buck on the marketplace.  Can do everything the other exporters can do, and if you're just looking for a simple export of your products this is probably the best deal you're going to find compared to others that set you up on a trial.
Super flexible, helped a lot with vendor payments for my multi-vendor marketplace, would definitely recommend it to anyone pursuing a similar model.  I like the visual interface, it was easy to pick up and adapt to what I need, an hour or so of work to set up."
"Very good app, super interface, even for inexperienced users. Support answered questions within minutes! I am thrilled :)"
"Good in theory but had a poor experience, on our end. The interface was a bit wonky making it hard to save our translations. Consistently had problems with translations showing up and for some reason our font would show up different with the translated version when it did render. Tried to cancel account but still got charged. Tried get a refund but company wouldn't allow it. All around bad experience."
"Long time I was looking for a good app where I can seperate different variant images for my different colors in the store. I've tested so many apps.. always we had some bugs or issues. No app could solve our needs. Finally I've found this app. THIS APP IS AMAZING! It can do anything we need AND the user experience inside the shopify product dashboard is just awesome and easy! We really love to work with this app. Definitly recommend this app. Additionally this app has the best support ever. We had some issue due to our theme. Jakob from this app fixed our issue although he was not responsible for it, it was a bug caused by our theme support. Thank you so much for this nice app and the good support! Adrian"
"I was introduced to Shopify by necessity. I'm really not a big fan TBH. You can't update themes like Wordpress without rebuilding (so said my theme builder). It's expensive with all the apps etc. and their customer support is friendly but ineffectual for my needs. I took over this site from a previous webmaster who made a mess of things. I had to find a bolt-on solution that made sense as the theme interface and capabilities were limited. In comes in Pagefly. It had the best reviews and was pretty intuitive. I built the first page with the free version to see how I'd like it. I was able to get a complex page done to my client's liking in a platform I was not familiar with. We purchased the plugin and continued on. I generally like the app and was able to dig in pretty quickly. It translates great on mobile. The customer service is quick and pleasant. My general criticisms are as follows (and honestly there could be workarounds that I'm a unfamiliar with, so take this with a grain of salt): 1. I wish I could organize the media library. It quickly becomes a confusing image dump after a bit. Maybe create an add a folder option 2. Saving sections does not mean they are global. You still have to edit one at a time if anything changes. 3. I've used up my allotted 30 Regular pages and need more. If I save as a collections or product page, I don't have the freedom to change the permalink, so it defaults to a Shopify page that I don't want. I'd like to be able to pick and choose between how many page types I want within the plan. To upgrade would be an unacceptable jump in expense for my client. 4. The interface gets buggy after extended use. It can get slow and glitchy or stuck when working down below the fold to where I can't properly edit the section. When this happens, I have to scroll up and click the top section to reset the editor. This is a real time suck. I'm a designer first and a web builder second, so I say this with that caveat in mind. Overall the app is helpful and certainly better than what Shopify offers. I hope they continue to improve and make the user experience something more like an Elementor, which performs almost like an Adobe product."
This app works great and does exactly what we need it to - makes the user experience very seamless. And it's super easy to use! The customer service is amazing - quick and super fast. Jake was able to help us resolve a product image scroll issue. Highly recommend!
"This app is levels a head of competition! Loving it! huge time savior, well refined, super easy interface with the software!"
"The support team is very helpful, and the user interface is so easy to navigate. I would recommend everyone to use this app!"
We have a LOT of different variations for our products and this is just what we needed. Simple interface and just works!
"I really recommend this app, but I also need to mention this: I'm not a fan of the switch from regular to paying version. The translations in the free version were almost all good, except for one which was too bad to keep, so I went on to the paid version, and the translations were all completely different, because it's ""neural translations"". The fact is, I had to go through the entire website to fix all of the translation mistakes made by this, so I spent a whole day on this. There is room for improvement. Service is really quick when there's a problem, so that's good, and the interface for text change is great, too bad it's tainted by the small starting issue. I would still definitely recommend the app as stated."
"This is exactly what I needed, I followed the tutorial and it seems to work fine. I had some inquiries about the app and the support team was pretty fast to reply. The interface could be improved more, make it easier to edit and view the inventory. Will update the review if something changes."
Scam App. Terrible Interface and Zero Instruction. I really doubt most of the reviews are real on this app. Will continue to charge after uninstall. Used it for 14 days and canceled it and noticed a few days later it was still on my shopify billing as an active subscription. They dont give you an instructions on removing or canceling your subscription so you have to email them. Then even if you cancel before the billing period they will still charge you the full amount and be smug about how its billed at the beginning. DO NOT RECOMMENED AT ALL.
"We use this app to essentially control all stock which shares the same base product, ie black t-shirts with multiple designs. The app has allowed us to have one master product, so we can keep a close eye on stock. So it works brilliantly for us - Although the interface could be a little easier to use and more fluid! 
On another plus, the support team are brilliant and very quick to act and help if you have any issues. 
Cheers to Billy for the help!"
"I needed an invoice generator and Sufio became useful to me. Very fast and responsive support team resolved the issue within a couple of hours. In particular, the convenient invoice editing system works great right in the program interface! I am satisfied and recommend this app!"
"Arshak is the best! He has been helping me with technical issues with my interface and translations. He is very kind and patience, and great at giving support step by step. Elen also very resolutive and understanding with my requests. So grateful for working with GTranslate team!"
"Hello guys, I want to leave here my review. When I launched this app I faced the problem in customizing the Language Selector in accordance to my Store design. I have communicated via chat asking team to help customise the widget. Susanna from GTranslate made a great work! I asked her several times to change this and that and she did it very quickly and very well. I appreciate that. Thank you very much! 5 stars. Concerning the App, I cannot tell something more at the moment, because I am still testing now. First what I noticed, that translation must be corrected manually, anyway! Automatic translation is not looks good. Even the same words can appear in different places with different translation. So, you should check every translated text by yourself. But interface for making corrections is very good! The second, what is very strange for me, the Shopify does not allow to create Language Folders, only Sub-Domains."
"Awesome App. Easy to use, great interface, wonderful customer service, and many great features. Keep it up"
"Great app, nice and easy to integrate products with the store and a much more friendly interface than other apps"
"Being under the trial period so far I really enjoy the interface this has to offer. The only thing I'd recommend changing is being more tailored to peoples searches as I got a lot of unrelated results to my inquiries. Otherwise I'd give it a full 5 stars. There are some things that need work overall I liked to product descriptions made, but also allowing easy modifying to make it more personal. Offering more available items for brand sponsorship would be beneficial."
Just installed this app to translate our e-shop. The interface is basic but very functional and works very good ! Many thanks to Elen who helped out in the setup !! I would recommend it
"Great customer service, whenever I had a problem they come quick with replies. It's an easy interface to learn, great app to get through with your customers."
"Best app for startup ,at very reasonable price. Happy with the service. Best part user friendly interface. special thank for my account manager for great support...(Deeksha and Neel)"
"I really like the interface and the capability to integrate different courier company. But to start a company with Shiprocket is not an easy. I raised so many questions but support person either never look at the issue or reply after so many days by then we would have resolved the issue ourselves. I would say, if their support is good, shiprocket would be better however, this is not the case currently. We face so many issues but sometimes either their number is not working or support tickets are not resolved."
"I used to use the Supply theme, and I had some basic coding knowledge and I was running 50+ templates with loads of different variations because I really didn't want to pay a subscription for variants. When I switched to the 2.0 theme, I lost all my personalization (Even though I copy and pasted the code in to the new templates). I was freaking out. I had a full website of personalized items and no way for customers to personalize without them. I read a review from another person suggesting to try this app... this free app. I was skeptical because free apps typically either don't work as you need them to OR there's always a catch. This app is amazing. I was able to quickly and simply add a wide range of different variations to my products. I learned the interface really quickly - it has so much versatility, and the conditional variation / input is great. I was able to get variations back up and running for 100+ items in just a few hours, and the functionality of those variations, and the appearance, worked a million times better than I had before. I haven't had to use their support team yet, but based on the other reviews, looks like they would be all over it if I did have a problem. This app has been a game changer for me - thank you for developing it!"
Good interface as compared to other apps. At start we faced many issues but our account manager Mr. Sanjeev Gulia guided us very well. Big thanks to Mr. Sanjeev.
"I tried to connect my dhl account but it is just not working....even though it says official dhl app, i was hoping the user experience was better."
"Excellent service and User-Interface, Called Directly to Configure the Settings. Will Update after few Weeks."
"Exactly what we were searching for!!! 
Design, user-friendly interface and very supportive developers. Customer support helped us to install the app properly and complete the customization properly on our shop.
You can check our lovely wishlist feature on www.luxuria.com.tr in 2 weeks!"
"though i am still figuring out, as far as what im experiencing now, i think its a user friendly app for new store so that they can collect as many detail as they can to build a good repo with their customer. And the interface is very straight forward."
"Simple and useful app. I was using another app earlier who was not responsive. 
You can customize templates.  
You can have your own sender id 
I liked that you can customize any sms template 
The interface is also clean and easy to use.
Overall nice experience."
Shipway is an amazing way to keep track of all our shipments. On top of that also has a clean and user-friendly interface. A must-have!
"Good app love the interface, would definetly recommend."
"Shipway is a one point solution for me. It begins with great customer service. The interface is intuitive and keeps getting better and really the team at Shipway has been absolutely fantastic to work with. I highly recommend Shipway to any kind of E-Commerce business. We have been using them for over 8 months and everything has been running smoothly. 
Great App, Great Company."
"Super easy to install, lovely User Interface ...and, overall, super easy to translate !!"
Easy to use interface and their customer support team is always ready to answer your query with full satisfaction. Overall a great experience with Shipway. Satisfied with the services.
"Such a clean, easy to use interface! I asked for help with the install and it was done in about 10 minutes. Couldn't be happier!"
"Great Apps, easy setup and interface looks good! It will be good if change have more options for the icon."
I use this app to capture emails and increase conversions. I like that it has a lot of options to customize it to fit with my store. It would be nice if the app had more options outside of just a spinwheel or lottery to further customize and enhance the user experience.
"I used it to help me. Great app! 5 of 5

Nice interface and works just fine. Its the exact thing i have been looking for! Thanks."
"Off the bat, the app is great and the guide to install and tweak easy to follow. A couple things I couldn't figure out were helped by the team, and they went a step above by helping with alignments of the cart and increasing the user experience :)
Definitely recommend if you have pickups and local delivery option for your business. *2nd time requesting help and they figured out an issue that was actually on shopifys side. Came up with a quick and easy solution, thanks!"
Works great. This functionality really should be built into the default shopify interface though.
"Our floral & gift store is using this app now to allow customers choose when they would like to receive their orders, by choosing if they want a delivery, or to pick up at the store. We customised the date range and time slot according to our business hours. The interface is user friendly, it's very easy to use as feedback by our friends who have tested out our newly launched website (we shifted from another e-commerce platform to Shopify recently) Installation is hassle free and the only thing we faced was the date picker window got truncated while on mobile mode. Once we wrote in, they replied within 6 minutes and got it fixed, that's just incredible."
It can help me better optimize the speed of my website and improve the user experience. Such a tool is very good. I hope there are more such programs.
"This app is exactly what I need and the support/development team is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! They have been extremely helpful, knowledgeable, and patient with my 238923471372392 questions. I love how responsive they are to questions - definitely top-notch customer service. The app's functionalities are great, the interface is easy to use, and its appearance in my store is beautiful. It definitely creates a great user experience and I know the team is making a bunch of improvements to make it even better. I tested TONS of other apps, and this beats the competition in terms of functionality, ease of use, price, support, and appearance. I would give it 10 stars if I could. Thank you!!!!"
"Great app have only had on for one sale, bu the interface seems easy to use and great at discounting lots of products"
Best customer service I have ever had. They kept working on solving my issues for an entire day and those stars under my products look great! They brought over my Etsy reviews. User interface is clunky/not intuitive and not mobile friendly.
The onboarding experience and implementation was very easy and the Okendo team was there every step of way always being very helpful and answering any questions I had. The interface if very user friendly and the support has been very responsive and helpful!
Super good on boarding experience and customer support. Very willing to help. Quick turn around times. They manage my whole transition from another reviews app. Easy to use interface.
"Fantastic App!
Shopify reports are not great for keeping workflow going, this app has a simple interface that lets you pull out those details (date of order, what ordered, address) and best of all includes Options data (if you use Bold Product Options App or Infinite Options).
They are quick to respond to any questions.
We use this app to get the orders on to a spreadsheet that links with Zapier to send people's work to Basecamp.... works very well.
The only improvements are if the Options could be organized (but not a big deal) or if they can integrate with Etsy as well so vendors can pull out all our orders from different platforms."
"I'm using the base version and this does exactly what I need since our business is exclusively pickup and delivery. Their online chat help is quick and helped resolve some initial setup issues I was experiencing. They also took the time to setup my timeslots, review all my settings and suggested some tips for better user experience. I spent alot of time with other Apps that didn't work the way I wanted and never heard back from their support. This App and service rocks! Thanks LogBase to getting my online store up and running!"
"I've used many Shopify discount creation apps, and honestly say this app is one of my favourites. Whether you sell a single product or a thousand, this application will get the job done. The app was installed successfully without any issues and requires no Coding. The interface is uncluttered, easy to understand and use. Whether selecting individual items or collections to place on sale, this app is flexible enough to meet your store's specific needs. The design team has given the end-user the ability to control and prioritize discounts that safeguard your stock from receiving multiple deals. Minor features such as Weekly or monthly repeating discounts, Smart discount rounding, and the ability to archive and restore your sales make this app stick out from the rest. Creating your own unique or selecting from the predesigned banners, make sure your customers know about your store's sales event. Placing banners can be a little tricky on some store templates. Not to worry, the support team is ready 24/7! https://www.kinkytoy.store"
"Easy Reports is a great app. It is a breeze to install and use. Just about any customized report you could want is just a few clicks away. After using it for a while, I contacted Juan about  a feature (for sales tax reporting) that I felt would make this great app even better.  Within 24 hours Juan had added my suggested feature to the Easy Reports interface for all to use. Easy Reports is one of the best,  time-savings Apps I use in my Shopify store. Keep up the great work!"
Amazing onboarding experience with Margaux! She and the Okendo dev team were able to make several changes to fit our unique business needs. Very user friendly interface as well.
"Completely failed me on Black Friday. No scheduled discount activated, and while live chat support was responsive, had to refer the issue to dev support, from whom I didn't receive a response until late the next day.
Spent the next four hours manually activating each discount within Shopify as I had customers waiting online for the sale to begin. If I had not been up (midnight sale launch) and not seen the issue until morning, it would have resulted in at least $1500 of lost sales.
I appreciate there was congestion due to the major sale weekend, and I was activating a few hundred products, but if after 30 minutes of the sale beginning nothing is on sale... the app has failed. 
Further, the interface for this app is clumsy. Should a product need to be moved from one discount level to another there is no display of which sale level it can be found in. A drag and drop across multiple sales, or at worst, allow a product to be de-activated from within any sale (not locked up as 'Used') would save a lot of time.
Waste of money, and nearly cost me a LOT!"
"Great app! we've tried several reviews apps and this one is the best by far. Great interface, easy to setup and use."
"LOVE the Okendo app and before coming to Okendo, I had another very popular review app. Okendo has a great interface and unbelievable customer support. It's a whole new world for me now that I have a great review provider! Margaux is FANTASTIC. So is Mor - both great people and very very helpful. Just do the trial and you'll be convinced it is the Reviews app for you!"
Amazing customer service - Amor has been extremely helpful in helping me set up the app for our shop. The interface is easy to use and I love all its unique features.
"We've used a lot of Shopify apps - Okendo is at the very top of our list. The integration with our website was clean, professional and on-brand. The interface is super intuitive to use. But what stands out the most is the onboarding with our Customer Success Manager. Allison went above and beyond to make sure we got the most out of Okendo. And she is there to support us as we continue to grow. Go with Okendo, you won't regret it."
"Great customer service. They were very helpful, and fixed my problem completely. The app interface also works great."
"This app truly is amazing! Currently, we're loving the interface and the aesthetics of the overall app support. So user-friendly and so much depth overall. We also received some very exceptional customer service courtesy of Margaux, who has been amazing might I add."
"Didn't like it at first because the interface is a bit confusing but once you get used to it, it's great and easy to use. Can do everything you need with the options available and fully-customizable. Support team are great!"
"We've recently move over from another back in stock app and I couldn't be more impressed with the customer care team here. Any question asked is responded to within minutes. The team is incredibly helpful. As for the app, we appreciate its clean interface, Klaviyo integration and sms option for our customers. Thank you, keep up the great work!"
"Excellent from the initial demo through publishing Okendo live on our site. While we were very happy with our past reviews platform, it didn't afford us the opportunity to add custom forms and attributes in such an attractive layout. Our site's overall professional feel was vastly improved and customers can now feel more confident purchasing after reading the measurements of other women with body types similar to their own. This app is a no-brainer and while we even worked with YotPo for years, Okendo far exceeds them in regards to the care they have for their clients, dedicated support staff, customizability, and user-friendly interface. https://www.midoribikinis.com/"
"Hands down the best review app on the market. If you're looking for an amazing interface with the proper integrations to build out a nice flow for customer reviews this is it. I looked at using a ""well known"" review app but found Okendo to be the perfect fit for what I truly needed; simple set up with Klaviyo (eventually Postscript), a clean customizable appearance on my site, and mobile-friendly UGC asks within the reviews. The biggest subtle but costly difference between Okendo and other review apps is pricing when your order volume picks up. Okendo is just what you need if you expect high order volume combined with true value. I signed up for the Power Plan and my account rep has been extremely helpful and she even set up my Klaviyo flows for me. I look forward to seeing the results this integration brings to our brand and the in-depth feedback from our customers."
"Fantastic team who helped build the app seamlessly into our website so the designs matched up. An easy, simple platform for reviews with a great user interface. Would highly recommend."
Hands down the best review app if not app overall for shopify. The customer service is outstanding and the team is always happy to help and do so in such a timely manner. Extremely easy user interface and constant updates to improve the efficiency of the app. Cannot recommend enough!
"The 5-star reviews speak for themselves with Okendo - it's got great functionality, an easy-to-use interface, and they're always an incredibly helpful team to deal with. Scott has been fantastic in implementing new design customisations and providing ongoing support so that reviews flow seamlessly across our 4 sites."
"Switched to Okendo from Yotpo. Interface is much cleaner, no bugs to date (constantly had issues on Yotpo), and support is super helpful."
"This is a great review app, the interface is intuitive and easy to use and their customer service is outstanding. Best of all it's very affordable and has all the functionality you need to grow your business."
"From excellent customer service, frequent updates and an easy to use interface, Okendo does it all. I am beyond happy with this platform and would highly recommend. As we used the app in a different way compared to the traditional implementation, the team jumped in to help customise the platform to best suit our needs. If you don't use Okendo, you're missing out!"
"By far the best review platform out there. I'm thrilled with the mobile-first design, easy-to-use back-end, and streamlined user experience. The team has been incredibly helpful and responsive, and made our migration an absolute breeze. Thanks for making such a great product, Okendo!"
very nice app and excellent support - pricing for fulfillment is competitive and they keep communication lines very open. I have had a few glitches with the interface and support worked diligently to resolve them.
"I cannot recommend Okendo highly enough!
Whatever Review Application you are currently using, I would recommend you to switch right now! You will not be disappointed! 
We were using Yotpo for 3 years and were recommended Okendo from a Shopify Plus Member. From the first moment of first contact I have been absolutely impressed by their service of excellence in customer service, knowledge and value-adding application. 
1. Amazing Customer Service!
2. Value Add Features!
3. Half Price of Competitors!
4. Excellent User Interface!
5. Absolute pleasure to work with!
Okendo handled the entire transition for Reviews across 7 Shopify stores along wth syndication. A process that took Yotpo 7 months with constant chasing up and lack of communication, took Okendo 24 hours. Okendo is half the price of Yotpo. And it is billed monthly. Thank you!
One of the most enjoyable, simplest and value-adding and capturing business experiences I have had on the Shopify platform. Thank you!"
"Okendo has been one of the best experiences working with Shopify App developers so far! The entire process from first contact to merging our reviews from the old review app to modifying details in our setup was top-notch and did not leave any room for complaints whatsoever. We were introduced to the product in an extended video session with discussing our personal setting and evaluation of how to best use Okendo in our specific given scenario. After that, the customer service team merged all of our old reviews into Okendo - more or less instantly. After configuring the basic options, we had tons of questions and modification requests, which were handled immediately and professionally, with extreme patience and friendliness.
Not only does the Okendo widget look great on our website - the back end interface does not leave any open questions either: it's intuitive, easy to use, almost self-explanatory by still maintaining all necessary options and details to configure all reviews in regards to your personal needs. All in all we highly recommend giving Okendo a try if you want to scale your review section to levels you might not even have thought about before; you will certainly not be disappointed! For our site, Okendo was an absolute game changer!"
Ship Hero interface is easy to use and their customer support has been super helpful with all the onboarding process and any questions I had. Recommended!
"Great, immediate support (even on weekends when they state on the site that they're away) and the interface works well. Am 100% satisfied with ShipHero."
"good app with easy interface so i can ease setup for my campaign, push notification is also good and easy for customer to understand and make a decision"
"This is [by far] the most impressive review software we've ever used, and we've evaluated quite a few different companies. Not only is the software and user experience -- both for us as business owners, and our customers superb -- but the customer service and detail to personalized attention we've received has been incredible. Okendo and the support team played a critical role in the rapid growth of our store and for that I'll be a customer for life."
Top 10 best apps for me! Does what it is supposed to do and it has a beautiful and effective interface.
"This program is excellent, it has best of two world, easy integration, intuitive in the interface. it made the integration with oberlo much easier in two clicks."
"Still learning the ropes but looks like a great app, hoping the easy to use interface makes this process run smoothly."
"This program stands out as having more functionality than others in the market. The user interface is much cleaner, migrating from oberlo was a snap, plus access to niche spy is such great value. definitely replaces apps I now will uninstall. Sourcing and fulfillment - undeniably excellent."
"Nice looking interface, gave my website a lift almost immediately! Easy to use as well. Customer support is amazing, they even helped me to make some changes my theme so that it would work better for the filter. Highly recommended."
This app is amazing! very nice interface and good function! It looks innovative and has good features.
"Cool app! Easy to use, good interface. Had the best conversation with Emile, their client support, she helped me to set up the store and even gave me some bonuses. We are still checking how our customers will like it, but from our side of view, it is really good. Thank you!"
"Although I am new to bon loyalty not long ago. But their interface is beautiful and functional. More importantly, its customer service is patient and humble, I think each of you is worth a try"
Thank you Emile! Very quick response and kindly helped me with my requests. Clear interface in the widget and all the functions I need! For FREE!
"Native Metafields help us everyday ! Editing our metafields had never been so easy. I wish I would have used this on ALL past projects.
Reached out to support for some help and we received a reply within the same day.
The interface is very intuitive and respect Shopify design! Last but not least : they add new features often! Highly recommend."
"The B2B Wholesale app from BSS Commerce is the only app which matches all our requirements, no other app allows creating rather complex custom pricing rules for certain customer groups. The support team is awesome! Our contact Emma answered very quickly and always on point. Their technician Minh Tri provided technical assistance in setting up the app and solving a couple of very specific problems in record-breaking time, extremely professionally! We use a custom theme in our shop and he even went the extra mile to adjust the app's styling to match the existing theme. All in all they provided the best support we ever experienced, the communication worked really well. The B2B Wholesale app has a very clean interface and offers a plethora of settings. The killer feature are the custom pricing rules which allow the exclusion of specific customer groups; we did not find any app which comes even close. This app is definitely >THE< one and only B2B app you need. If there are any problems, do not hesitate to contact them - you won't be disappointed!"
"I wanted to offer my customers a reward program and stumbled across this gem. It ticked all the boxes, is simple enough for both me and my customers, with an easy interface. Emile helped me and was awesome and patient, Thanks Emile, I appreciate your suggestions and assistance. Great customer service and easy program"
Nous souhaitions proposer à nos clients B2B de commander en ligne avec les tarifs wholesale. Le service client nous a aidé pas à pas à tout configurer et à tout customiser pour que l'interface soit en ligne avec notre charte graphique. Réactifs et efficaces.
"This app is amazing, interface is gorgeous - everything works perfectly and it's FREE! Dale has instantly served me in order to ensure that all is integrated well, I'm in love. Thank you"
I found this app to add a loyalty program to my shop. The interface was super easy to set up and the customer service was very responsive. Emile walked me through what I needed with ease. Highly recommend giving this a try.
"Great interface, fast and easy to set up, and Emile gave me excellent support with everything I needed. I recommend it!"
"I would rate more stars if I could. The invoices are easy to set up and completely customisable, the interface is user friendly, and the system is seamless. AND that was before I experienced their awesome customer service. It took less than a day for them to respond to my question plus they jumped online and made changes in our code. If you are looking for 3rd party invoice printing app for your Shopify store - this is the app for you"
"This app is a great, versatile start for my loyalty program. The interface is clean, and the widget is designed prominently without interfering with the shopping experience. I want to thank Dean and Sunny for their excellent customer service, helping me to use the app to its full potential."
"The interface for this rewards program is customizable and a perfect modern addition to my small shop and learning program. Thank you, Bon!"
Still new to this app.  Very nice interface and the customer service questions I have had have been answered EXTREMELY quickly by customer service.  Also love how it has a built in affiliate program.
"One of the best digital delivery companies out there.  I switched over to them right before a big campaign (I know, not the smartest thing) but I loved their interface and how they incorporated the download now link on the order confirmation page. As well as beautifying the download page itself. 
The promotion went off without a hitch and everything continues to work great. The download speeds seem faster than another option on here. I had a question and their customer service responded quickly.  Been more than happy with them."
"Very easy for a non-techie-type like me to use. Clean interface, good customer service backed by Pixel Union."
"I'm posting this as someone who absolutely loves the templates, but also as someone who has a strong and discerning eye for good user experience. 
If you're looking for something elegant, non-intrusive, and flexible, this is by far the best I've used. 
Hope they continue to expand their insights and offer A/B testing options, but for now, this made me leave Pixy and I look forward to paying for the service after my trial is over."
"Awesome app! Amazing support as well. Super quick and helpful, answered all my questions to get up and running. Highly recommend! Love the interface for send and replying to customers. Works well on Shopify Ping so you can get push notifications when new replies come in. 
A++"
"This app is great,it helped me to calculate shipping costs automatically with a nice and friendly interface."
"Easy to use simple interface, with great options for exporting and scheduling, including email, ftp, google drive etc."
"I've tried other popular app for a year but Ryviu is the most efficient, very easy to use, modern user interface (both internal and external) and also works better for customers. so giving it a 5* !"
So far the service has been great. Shipping time was reasonable and the print quality look good too. The interface is seamless and the upload process is simple.
easy and no coding is required. Instant configuration with best interface and design. One tap and you are done.
"Intuitive interface, easy to implement all product into FB store in few minutes. It's a must try app"
Order Lookup helps our customers find their order of lockpicks and bump keys faster that the traditional interface!
"Very good interface, very good service ! I highly recommend this builder.
The designs are modern and very easy to customize."
Cool app! Perfect for my website! Friendly interface. Easy to understand. Different settings. Thanks guys!
I really like this app. It's simple and straightforward to get your feeds into the Google Merchant Center with this app. One of the best things about SocialHead apps is that they have simple and easy screens/user interfaces and most importantly have an awesome support team which responds quickly in the best of their capacity to fix/help with issues and queries. This app has a lot of potential to evolve further with much enhanced functionalities like bulk edits on product groups/collections for google/facebook catalog fields. Happy to recommend this app for anyone looking to add social platform shopping to their stores. Good luck SocialHead!
Great app to have when dropshippers let you down. Sell products from Amazon with prime. Easy to use interface.
"So we've been using Springbot for about 3 months now. I'm super happy with them and the data they collect. Their service has so many features and benefits. I won't go into the details of what they offer, you can read up on that elsewhere. There are a few things that I think they can improve upon. They aren't deal breakers, and I've found work arounds for them:
• They don't have an app so you need to post from a desktop.
• Facebook Social hub only allows 1 image at a time per post.
• Doesn't autofill Hashtags like IG
• Will not simultaneously post on IG and Facebook.
• Image size must be 3mb or less which ads time on my end because I have to resize images.
• Some of the data can be funky at times such as abandoned cart info.
What you should know is that their customer service is on point. I completed the on-boarding process with Ben. He was patient and helped me learn the interface quickly. We had weekly calls where he answered all my questions, and helped me get everything set up. After my first month I was assigned to Andrew. He's been super helpful giving me marketing ideas and helping me maximize my ROI using their service.  I get responses to my emails in a timely fashion. I've been really happy with his suggestions, and he always makes himself available when I have a question or want to set up a meeting to discuss future actions. My Facebook acct. manager is Nichole. She's also been super helpful, answering my emails after hours, giving me suggestions and really helping me maximize my sponsored facebook posts. This was something that I was doing on my own before Springbot, and she's really helped bring it to the next lever. She sends me weekly reports allowing me to see what works and what doesn't. 
The best way I can describe Springbot is: It's like having my own mini-marketing team helping me reach my customer base and make the most of my time. As a small business owner, It can be hard to find the time to fine tune this part of the business, but as we all know its very important to do so. The team at Springbot helps me do just that!"
"Makes data-driven marketing easy. Great interface. Nice integration with Mailchimp, and remarketing ads are included with a subscription. Nice!"
"Too hard to do business with and unprofessional.
User interface is very basic and lacks key fulfillment functionality. 
They also demand to see your current pricing contract with your suppliers.
If you want to do business the right way use SHIPSTATION, They are the leaders.
We tried with you, but you failed us!
Thank You"
really good user experience! it works as expected and is impressive as its a simple application. Nice!
So far it's good and does what it says. Interface could be updated and prettier to look at. Continuing to use until it does not accomplish what I need.
"amazing app! it works exactly the way it was I expected to and does the job very well. a lot of customization options in the app, a lot of templates that look very beautiful, great interface in the app."
Amazing features. Beautiful templates. Simple user interface. The app helped to double our sales. What I can say? LOVE THIS APP!
Easy interface to work with and the customer service team are super diligent. They reached out to me not the other way round and we had a really useful zoom call to optimise the platform
"I was looking for an app to create popups throughout my site with an easy to use interface. I tried a few cheap/free apps, but Personizely was absolutely the easiest one to use! Well worth the money every month since it saves me so much time versus the other apps I tried. Definitely recommend!!"
"This app is doing exactly what I need and looks good doing it. I checked out a few apps, this one is a little more expensive but worth every penny. The interface is very easy to use. I was able to make a pop up, customized to our brand in minutes and it blended in seamlessly to our style.
But even more important than that is the amazing customer service! Sergiu went above and beyond helping me... our website has some very specific needs. He actually built a customization into the app for us! (could be because I'm special, or because they are awesome.) They even spent time over the weekend helping me configure it. Highly recommend this app."
"The customer support is amazing.  They are very prompt, polite and precise.  They even made a change to their app based on an observation I made just to make a certain feature of the app more user-friendly.   Not to mention, the app does exactly what it should and more.  It has a user-friendly interface with some great features.  Well worth the money."
Great flexibility and easy user interface. It makes building email list from your site simple also giving shoppers messages at the right time to close sales.
"Just started using this, but from the looks of it, it will do exactly what we need. Great interface and lots of options to test! Thanks!"
"Didn't work initially using Empire Theme. Requested support and they managed to fix the problem straightaway. I also made some special request to further improve the interface in my e-commerce store. All of this completed within 24 hours. Top notch support and the app works great, even with a free plan. The social counter is a plus for me."
"Displaying real social proof based on real orders proven by independent 3rd party is for sure hack that gives a lot of credibility to our service. 
I really liked how fast you can jump in to using the service - very easy setup, very clear interface and logics of service. Also fair pricing."
"I literally can not say enough good things about this app. 
Above and beyond any of the actual functionality of the app (which is saying a lot, trust me), the customer service is by far so outstanding it is worth the cost of the app alone. There has not been one instance where I have not been able to get a quick response, and an actual helpful one at that, and more than that, they have gone to the extent of actually adding functionality into the app to help me get it to work the way I needed it to on our site.
They have literally sat in a chat with me and helped brainstorm solutions to quirky setups we needed their app to do with our site, which is also one of the great things about Personizely, every time you are in the app using it, there is a chat window down in the corner just waiting to assist you. No leaving the platform to write an email and hoping it doesn't get buried in an inbox before it's seen.
The app itself is beautiful, the interface is intuitive and clean and from a design perspective extremely pleasing to use. 
The options of what you can do and what can be done with Personizely are endless, and it is actually one of the things I am most excited about now that we have launched our site is to dig even deeper into the app and see what more we can come up with to use it for.
On that note, we ended up looking into Personizely as a way to handle a free gift with first purchase, after being completely unsatisfied with every single option being touted as an app for that particular purpose. It was literally the last app I ended up on while I was researching, and probably because in general it wasn't even advertised as being used for that purpose, but that is exactly what is so powerful and dynamic about the app.
I was literally at my wits end with every other app I had researched, I had spent days at that point going in and out of each option and trying to weigh which one would even get close to what we needed, and as soon as I landed on Personizely the largest weight was lifted off my shoulders.
If anyone has any questions or any doubt about using this app please feel free to shoot me an email- christopher(at)nolieandus.com and I will be more than willing to verify how helpful it has been to our store but do yourself a favor and go ahead and give the free trial a spin, there is no way you will regret it."
This is the best app for designing custom products. The interface is great. The customer service team is great. There have been issues with this app but they are great to help me out.
"Fluent interface with helpful features, even in the free version"
"Highly instructive interface, very user friendly, looking forward to shift permanently on the services. They set in up in a way that you get all the answers you need as soon as you install and start using. On top of that they seems to be winning over competition - price efficient. >Looking forward for continuity"
"Simple and functional App, but above all quick and attentive Customer Service. 5 stars deserved, I highly recommend this app created to simplify the user experience in your e-commerce!"
Really easy to use and a simple interface that allows you to create codes quickly.
"good stuff, very use-friendly interface"
"great app with plenty of products, excellent support and user friendly interface. Made our life so much easier."
Very good interface for dropshipping products with ease. They have some options for shipping but I have not tried them yet
"I love this app. The fact that i could have my logo on the tape used on the package is great! I used to use oberlo and a few others, but being able to have some of the customizations for personalization is the best. The support is very helpful as well. The UI/UX interface isn't as great as oberlo, but the features is what makes it better. Highly recommended."
"Fast and helpful customer service. Had few questions, got them resolved in a day! Easy to use interface. Would recommend!"
"By far the easiest amazon affiliate linking app for Shopify!  
⭐Very straight forward interface without unnecessary 'distractions'.  
⭐Easy setup as well.  I had some questions and needed assistance and ⭐the support was amazingly quick and efficient!  
⭐Very happy with this app and would definitely recommend it to anyone getting started with adding Amazon Affiliate products to their Shopify site!  ❤️️Thanks for making my life easier Linkify!!!    Super!"
"Cody was a great help in arranging the install and answering questions. Still need the install team to fix some issues, but it's very simple interface to use as someone who doesn't want to get involved in coding/script etc. Not as much functionality as V1, but I like the integration with shopify checkout to make the process much smoother for the consumer, and hopefully for me too. Hopefully more functionality can be added over the coming weeks/months to take it to another level."
"Quick and easy onboarding experience, also easy to create and install the pixel, great user experience"
Super-easy interface gives you full-control over importing AliExpress reviews into your online store.
"This was the best DS app back in late 2018. I switched over from Oberlo. I'm not sure what happened but it's full of bugs now. Orders don't fulfil, there's variant issues, the city doesn't fill, the auto captcha doesn't work sometimes, and many more. I've been in touch with customer support (Their team is great for the most part) for months now and there's been no fixes at all. I even tell them about bugs that's been plaguing my experience for months and they just tell me it's not on their roadmap. Which sucks considering I'm paying $127 per month for this service. Updates come out, they introduce new features which are hit or miss for me personally but they don't focus on the core of their business, the apps functionality. With the app not even working as advertised, everything else doesn't even matter. A lot of my time is being wasted tinkering with options trying to get the app to do what it's supposed to, fill orders. This shouldn't be the user experience. I understand bugs happen, but it would be nice to know that they're at least aware and working on fixing the issues rather than waiting for a lot of users to complain and then do something. It's like my $127 doesn't matter until 50 other people also experience the same. Eagerly waiting for another DS service to introduce an Auto Captcha feature and I'm done, unless they can fix this app which I highly doubt and I'll gladly change my review.
UPDATE: As of July 4th 2019 almost all issues are resolved. There are still a few bugs but nothing as bad as before."
Great app and customer support - live chat support is amazing. Easy to setup. Has global pricing adjustment available. Simple to use interfaces for product and category management.
"Great app! It’s working great so far and has helped reduce my workload with interacting with the Walmart Canada interface, plus great customer support. I have no complaints so far."
Great app! Very fast import and nice interface. Recommend! Enjoy using it. The best about it is that is absolutely free!
"the best app for seo, this app is verygood to boost my products. frenly user interface and easy to customize"
"Just amazing! :) I’ve been using this app for a while and is good though. I like the easy user interface, lot of handy settings and works just great! I can tell it’s better than the other apps on the market for this solution. .. You have to pay after 14 days but yeah, that’s business baby."
"So far so good, seems pretty easy and the user interface is really friendly. Excited about the results!"
"Tidio works just great, it was recommended by a friend and it has honestly been the the best for my startup. Great tools and configuration options for bots, messages, client lists, etc. Also the interface is super fast for potential customers unlike others around. 100% recommended!"
"I had an issue with my Arabic interface, and it was solved in few minutes with the support team. Their support team is available all the time and helpful."
App is hugely helpful. Clean. Great for organizing product pages and more. Great user experience. :)
The application works properly on our site nina-trade.com and for what it is intended for. Simple and functional with a friendly interface.
easy to use!!! site interfaces well for new beginners .  cant wait to see if i convert to sales using it
"So far so good, Need more experimenting, but clean user interface, good help, Hope it will help my store"
This app is the holy grail for people who want advertise their translated website to Google etc... It took the translation automatically from my website and generated the feeds while importing all the settings from your store. It's all you need if you're looking to advertise in multiple languages/currencies. Interface is also very intuitive.
"Very well developed app, perfect integration, user friendly interface and interesting features, a world of options and all this for free!
The support is absolutely fantastic and super fast. congratulations, keep it up!
App sviluppata molto bene, integrazione perfetta, interfaccia user friendly e funzionalità interessanti, un mondo di opzioni e tutto questo gratuitamente!
Il supporto è assolutamente fantastico e super veloce. complimenti, continuate così!"
"Um dos poucos APP que tem interface amigável, fácil configuração e realmente funciona e nos deixa em situação de paz."
Easy to setup with the very good user interface. I did have any compatibility issue. Now I'm setting and watching my shop sells increasing. Thanks for this app.
"The Lebesgue team is amazing. The support and care they show for us as a new business, the marketing insights you find all in one place, an easy-to-use interface, the affordability... make this app (and team) an asset to our business. We would recommend 100%."
"This app made adding trust badges really easy, and they look AMAZING! Big fan. Simple user interface and plenty of design/badge choices."
So far so good with this app. The interface is a bit cluttered with ads regarding all their other apps and services and hopefully they go away when I leave this review including an annoying popup that keeps coming.
"The setting interface is very simple, intuitive and practical. It has the functions I want. I'm a new shop. I can't believe I'm really eligible for permanent free use?"
"Such a complex application! The support team simply replies to talk with them over a WhatsApp number. Do not recommend it to anyone who has no technical expertise. The user interface is horrendous. Very difficult to navigate and actually understand what you are setting up. Descriptions in English are poorly written. ---- No, the team did not provide any kind of call support. Instead, they sent a WhatsApp Audio Message explaining why they want their customers to get on a call with them. I understand that it saves THEIR time but what about the dashboard? Are they going to make to better for small merchants? ---
One more thing -- they ask us to get on a call! We are a team of females who are working from the comfort of our homes. How can they expect us to get on calls with strangers? How come they cannot make it easier for us who do not have expertise? We have not seen such poor support here on Shopify in a long-long time!"
Excellent support. Excellent app. Excellent pricing. Pleasant interface and lots of options for affiliate marketing. Highly recommend.
"If you want a referral program for your Shopify store, this app is definitely the best! A lot of useful features, easy management and clean interface. Knowledgeable customer support. And the app's pricing is very reasonable."
"So far so good! The interface is excellent, the functioanlity is exactly what we are looking for. Well done everyone!!"
"I got this app 2 days ago and absolutely love it. it's sleek and very easy to use. I love the interface, steps to take, affiliate dashboard and many features included to create a successful affiliate program. I couldnot wait to end my trial and subscribe so I can fully use this app in my store. Customer service is also amazing, all my questions answered promptly.  Thank you Affilo!"
Wonderful experience. Very useful app with very easy to use interface and methodology. The app costs just 25 bucks but I am happy to pay even a 100 bucks for it. Lots of features and I see that the developers are continuously working on adding more features in the app. They have listed out the updates in the app which is amazing.
"So sooo easy to use. I am impressed with the interface. Has many useful features and offers a lot of value.
Another very important fact is that, we can create as many affiliate programs for our store as we like using this app."
"If you do not want to look cheap and ordinary to your affiliates & influencers, this is the only app on the app store which helps your brand. It makes your brand look like a brand.
Also, very easy to use, many useful features and most importantly, the best interface.
Key highlights:
* Stunning design and ease of use
* Very easy to setup
* Almost all the features that you need for your affiliate marketing
* Friendly customer support.
* Cheaper than other apps."
"By far the best affiliate marketing app. Compared some other solutions before settling for this one.
Very easy to use interface. Plenty of options and control.
I can feel how much attention the developers paid to the details in this app.
Also, excellent customer support. Thank you!"
LOVE the interface on the Affilo app — super clean and easy to navigate. Any questions or minor issues I've had have been solved by the creators in less than a day! Great support.
"Very friendly interface, easy to use and excellent support. Recommend it! This app and developer gets 5 stars from me"
For sellers that are new to the world of SEO this app is perfect with its easy to understand interface and definitions of jargon throughout. I like that it uses JSON LD structured data. The customer support team is also quick to reply and detailed in their answers to my questions. My website: www.gearscanada.com
Well made point system with quality like all other Bold apps. The interface to add product exclusions is very limited however.
"This App is amazing! Easy and userfriendly interface and you can customize the pop up messages the way you like!
The customerservice is on point! They literally answered me in about 5 minutes and the overall conversation was very good! I totally recommend this App!"
"Testing it during the free period and this app looks promising.
It imports all of your products so you can search for a product just as you would normally and then simply add an order limit. The interface is familiar and easy to use.
Over limits are caught on the product page add to cart and the cart edit with a nice message for the customer."
This app has been pivotal for filtering our collections. The technical support is great and the interface is exceptionally easy and straight forward to use.
"Very helpful app! This is very important for our repeat customers. I think it's a fair price for the functionality. 
Development note: I needed to remove the ""Add to Cart"" button in the ""My Favorites"" list page because my products have variations. So if you have this concern don't worry! The developer responded to me immediately and removed that button from my interface. I was also able to replace the heart image to a different color that matches my theme better."
"nice attempt but overall found it is easier to ""get"" you to fix it with the app then explain or guide the issues resolved. the interface is clear and simple
issues: 
References inline CSS done by Shopify imported code. 
References plaintext emails for image links. 
lack of details in regards to resolving issues similar SEO tools exist online and don't require using an in control panel access to scan"
We use is for Mugnster.com and app has very descriptive and easy-to-use interface. We definitely recommend this SEO app everyone. Thank you!
"We have been very happy using Product Filter & Search. It has enhanced the user experience on our site, and improved conversions. The support team is always extremely responsive and helpful. They are always improving the app and adding features, and continue to keep up with changes and needs of our Shopify store."
"I use this app to link my Shopify store to eBay. It works great and their service team is responsive, even on Sunday evening. There is a time investment required for the initial set-up. It wasn't painless...but once your listings are set to your liking and you have a handle on the interface, it's set it and forget it. I previously  used this app for 2 years with my BigCommerce store and it's the only app I carried over into my Shopify store. I did try Shopify's eBay integration first, I didn't last 1/2 hour before I looked for inkFrog."
Beginner Friendly User Interface. Customizable at every level and you can see the previews of what your customers see in the emails. Great App!
Am still new to this App but the interface is user friendly and easy to use.I like it already and I hope it will be a reliable tool to my new business.
Great app to enhance user experience for people using mobiles. if you can't get your mobile page speed up then this is the next best thing.
"I am an accountant, and a client had this app before coming to me for their bookkeeping.  He used this app to import sales receipts from Shopify to his Quickbooks.  This saves me so much time because I don't have to create individual sales receipts, instead, they come in automatically.  I had some trouble because some of the transactions didn't import correctly and where missing.  I emailed the Bold Commerce support line and Jerico got back to me within the day.  Jerico was extremely helpful and helped me solve our problem.  Customer support was A+.  If they had to improve on one thing it would be the app's interface in Shopify.  It's very simple and user-friendly which is good but because of that, it seems the options are limited and you cant view all the mappings and options from the user's side.  All in all, an excellent app, I've recommended and used on all my other Shopify clients."
"Just downloaded the app, and the interface looks really good. simple and fast set up."
"I have been using this app for a few months now and overall it works well. It takes time to get used to the user interface and how to manage your listings, but this is never going to be easy whatever tool you use. Synchronisation between shopify and ebay can fail for a number of reasons, so it takes time to understand what all of the errors actually mean. Saying that the support team are very responsive and helpful when it comes to understanding what is broken. I have raised a few enhancement requests, but there is very little appetite to enhance the app which surprises me."
"Rakesh is knowledgeable and responds very quickly! This app is highly recommended for several reasons. One-time fixed pricing is a fantastic deal, not to mention an easy-to-use interface to make adjustments and install without headache. A quick and attentive helpdesk is also a plus."
"i use this app on all my stores, it is very simple to use and really help to convert abandoned cart. The user interface is really simple and fast. Dashboard offer a nice view."
"Outstanding service and app, includes all we need. We are fulfilling our shopify orders with Amazon and have been looking a while now for a simple return possibility for our clients. Return Prime has all we need: DHL (Germany) Interface, a customizable return center and customizable emails. The app will save us a lot of time each month and makes returns a lot easier for our customers. Their customer service is also notable, they provided quick help with a small interface issue we had and even translate an email template for us. Thank you guys, keep up the good work!"
"This app helped me not leave money on the table. The interface is user friendly, and you can get around pretty well."
"I just tried it, and what's i loved about it is the interface, it's so easy to configure. i really like it. and i hope it do the job."
"So, long story short: This is straight forward one of the best apps I have seen so far. Stable, extremely flexible, comprehensive and easy to use. For both, the admin and the customer. Also: Very professional, very dedicated, very TOP-NOTCH team, that will back you up no matter what. WORTH EVERY CENT! Now the details: Easy to setup and extremely flexible. You can customize literally EVERYTHING. Every text/caption/error message etc. can be translated in what ever language you want. VERY multilingual! Email templates can be individualized via HTML/SCC. It will look like a native part of your store and absolutely NOT like an app, that is running in the background. Comprehensive admin panel (got used to it in no time). All returns and exchanges summed up in clear cockpit charts. You will never loose track of ANY of the customer's requests. Speaking about the customer: A very clear and straight forward customer interface. As a customer you can issue your request in literally just a few mouse clicks. Also customers can track the status of their request at any time with the integrated history/tracking function. A HUGE plus for customer experience! Functionality: All data is synched with your store virtually in real time. Never ever had to manually synch my orders/returns/exchanges. Runs extremely smooth and stable. All auto emails will be delivered within minutes, and can be resent manually if there is the need for it. Now here comes the best: The team behind the app. Cannot tell you how AWESOME those guys are! They will respond quickly, minor requests will be resolved within just a few hours. Even for more complicated requests they will never need more than 1 or 2 days. Be sure, that they will back you up NO MATTER WHAT! Very professional, very dedicated, very TOP NOTCH!"
"inkFrog has been a great addition to my business.
The user interface is very easy to use and the app does a great job in syncing my inventory in my Shopify store with eBay.
The price is very affordable and the customer service is awesome!
Thanks inkFrog"
"I would guess that anyone reading this review is looking for an automated way to tag orders to streamline some type of back-end logistics. This app is amazing - it does everything it says it will and the support team has been fantastic. The whole interface, ui & process is extremely easy and intuitive to work with. 5-stars no question. Thank you!"
"Great app. Easy to use and a very friendly interface, does the job it is supposed to do and that too for free.."
"We wish the interface was easier to navigate and more user friendly. Other than that, it seems to work fine."
I have installed it & it's super easy & the user interface is so smooth. keep it up. Keep improving & innovate new features.
Great app with lots of tagging features. The user interface is user friendly and unlike other apps there is no need to have a coding degree to implement rules. Support staff are very responsive if you ever have questions and they are continually working to improve the app. I've installed it in the two Shopify stores I run.
"Really simple to use and really easy to install.
Very nice clean looking invoices.
Not obvious how to edit orders using the interface but that's the only fault I could find with this app. Highly recommend using it, thanks for creating."
"This is the eBay to Shopify inventory and listing manager you've been looking for. Trust me, you'll find no-better value than this. It's UI is fast, simple, responsive and easy to use.
The inkFrog web interface makes eBay's look like Windows 95 or worse. If you've ever been frustrated by eBay's total lack of intuitiveness than you know what I'm saying. 
What this app does better than anything else is manage listings, inventory and more between Shopify and eBay. It excels at that primary job and does it better that anyone out there in my opinion."
"I found this app as a replacement for an older one we had that was being discontinued. I needed something that was easy to use, had a good interface, and was easy to adapt to what I needed. This did the trick. Also, great customer service (fast and efficient)."
"Cool app, exactly what I was looking for! Easy to use interface and easy to install. Got up and working in a few minutes."
"Excellent app, with FANTASTIC customer support. They helped me out get a complex project on track. Before this app I was very worried not be able to meet my client's requirements. But Customer Fields is very sweet to use and helps you with things that otherwise would be very complicated. It has a very nice interface, allows you to set up your form as a multi step or single page one, allows you to create rules to hide and set fields. AND, has an API that allows you to set hooks, and other advanced functions. All in all I'm very happy with this app."
"Great work from vify, the use interface is beauty, making invoices is simple
there is no hidden charges.. loved this app."
"No longer free to use but it's a good eBay tool regardless...
With Inkfrog's recent addition of order integration with Shopify, this app deserves 5 stars!  I have been using Inkfrog Open for 2 years, longer than I have Shopify and love that I can customize my Ebay business.  Great listing templates, manage messages and an easy user interface all make Inkfrog Open an amazing FREE tool to help us as business owners manage our Ebay business.  5 stars!"
"It amazes me how much this App can do; very functional! Whether you're looking to create an extra small function in your store or use this App to level up your whole website's user experience, it is definitely worth a try. I believe it will surprise you too!Professional&supportive customer services and developing team, quick in responses, also willing to go the extra mile helping. Many, many thanks to Katelyn& Kyle!"
"The Customer Fields app helped us improve the user experience and the design of the Shopify forms. Really helped us meet the business' goal.
Thanks."
"So far, so good. The interface is fairly straightforward; however, you can improve by being a little bit more clear on where to paste the code for HTML noobs like me! :)"
"After using another very expensive app on Shopify to allow our team to scan and pick, I found iPacky and decided to make the jump. We are so thankful we did! The interface is easy to use, the scanning is fast, the orders automatically sync from Shopify into iPacky and now they offer the ability to assign Bin Locations to each product by either importing them or scanning the product and manually entering data. You can also sort your pick slips by SKU, Bin Location and other options. The support team in phenomenal! They answer questions in a very timely manner and have even implemented suggested changes we made to the app that they felt would be beneficial for all users. If you are looking for an affordable app that allows your team to scan and check products as they pick, definitely try iPacky! It's worth the money."
"Our experience with both Kyle and Katelyn have been consistently extraordinary.  They both have shown to take great care and pride in solving anything, from developer to user interface issues. The response is almost immediate and in many cases they will offer temporary solutions before a permanent solution is obtained as well as really thinking through an issue and create a multitude of ways and workarounds to achieve what is needed.  I am so glad that these extended fields are NOT part of Shopify as I know that there is no way we would have been able to have some of our issues taken care at the level that they have.
Helium in my opinion in customer service, knowledge, attentiveness and creativity IS the Gold Standard that ALL companies should strive to be.  They feel more like really smart caring friends then just a paid service.
Thank you guys,
Dorian"
"We absolutely love inkFrog. Keeping track of inventory is a giant pain in the a** when it comes to eBay stock and shopify stock. inkFrog has provided the ability to FINALLY control our inventory management & listings in one centralised location. This is a huge time saver, and huge increase in productivity.
The sophisticated app has a brilliant user interface which allows the set up to be in less then 10 minutes (amazing right!).. and I can definitely see that so much work has been put into this app. 
There are not many web applications today that integrate with eBay as easily as inkFrogs & it is a definitely worth acknowledging the difficulty around this type of integration (eBay AUS is different to other countries.. even stitchlabs don't have the ability to integrate to eBay AU!. Listing restrictions... inventory, pricing differentiation... its all very complex)
Thanks inkFrog - you have done a phenomenal job. This App needs to be showcased on shopify!
Kanetha"
Easy to use and nice interface with product images and description. Our pick and pack errors are now close to zero!
"Absolutely superb app! I have come over to Shopify from Magento Go, and the trouble we had importing to eBay from Magento was not worth the hassle. So on installing this app I was a little sceptical that the process would be the same. I needn't have worried though! From the slick interface, great technical support, and ease of use, I would highly recommend inkfrog to anyone!"
"I've been using this app for both my Etsy and Shopify shop. Simply love it! I've saved lots of times and myself from frustration. The customer service is excellent, very responsive and very friendly. Like any apps, there are some interface you need to get used to. My advice is to do a smaller batch first."
"Best App out there nothing to campare with other bulk editors -  and best of all its free , no hiden costs , beautifull interface & easy to use and the support is allways there to help us out , they fixed all kind of problems we had. 5 stars from Mixama to you VELA. Love you well done"
"This app is was SO easy to use and very intuitive! The interface is very smooth (smoother than Shopify dare I say) and the support was so fast to respond, even at midnight on a Tuesday.
Looking forward to more updates! Have never tried such a good free app."
"I have had the most outstanding experience with this app and the support team. Kyle, in particular, was extremely responsive and knowledgeable. 
I upgraded from the Pro to the Advanced account, and it was worth every penny. With only a basic working understanding of coding, I found the team very helpful as they guided my build of a custom interface and database on the foundation of the app.
Based on thorough research of the marketplace, this app is one of a kind for the job of storing customer data, and their service is best-in-class. Would recommend x10! THANK YOU KYLE"
"Amazing! We switched from a very over-priced search / smart collections app to SoBooster Ultimate Search and it is 10x better at a fraction of the cost. Finally, a search app that is super fast-loading, with barely any delay after making settings changes. Integrated seamlessly with our Prestige theme without any CSS to make it look like our branding!!! Loads of built-in features and adds ons out of the box. Great back-end interface – very easy to set up and understand. We had a few customizations needed and the support team was prompt and helpful getting us up and running! Only negative is that I found the Chat support could use some improvement in answering my questions more thoroughly at times. Overall excellent so far!"
"AutoDS
The interface is convenient and recommended! , Bulk's continuous operation in a convenient and complete way! Unlimited!
highly recommend. Aviram Dahan"
"WOW! Seriously the most helpful and responsive customer service team. Chelsea was beyond helpful. Not only is the user interface super easy to use and novice friendly, but Customer Fields was more than happy to custom integrate additional functions based on my needs...AND DID IT FOR FREE! 10/10 Hands down the best customer service on any Shopify App out there."
"One of the best apps/tools out there. Made my site instantly a nicer photo viewing experience. Too easy to use and install! so cheap too. Well worth having. User interface is clean, crispy and easy to use."
This app is definitely a must-have for any shop with multiple products. It raises the bar of user experience. Not sure if you need it? Look at the websites of those who wrote reviews. Still not sure? Compare it to the other websites. Still not sure? Try it free!
"Love this app. We have either Power Tools Filter Menu or Power Tools Suite installed on all 5 of our stores (we've more recently been installing the suite since you get a lot of additional functionality for not a lot more cost). We couldn't live without filter menus. It's a huge plus for user experience and navigation, especially since our stores each have hundreds of products (at minimum) with fairly technical specifications.
The sort by popularity functionality is a very nice touch as well.
It's very easy to use, considering the complexity of what the app is actually enabling you to do. Installation and setup is relatively easy as well.
We wouldn't run a Shopify store without it."
"Possibly one of the best apps in terms of functionality. You can see it in use on http://global.amantelingerie.com/ It was rather complicated to install as they did not have an integration method for the theme used (ICON). However, with a little bit of help from my IT team we were able to install it without much trouble. Not the greatest backend interface, but works brilliantly. Probably one of the BEST apps we have installed so far. Thanks so much!"
"From creating an account to uploading my items, I find it very easy to use. The app interface is so neat! Still exploring all the features but I will surely recommend this app to other drop shippers. This app has all the features I am looking for to help with my business."
"Wow... That was easy!
Quick integration, imported items from Walmart, and Amazon in a few seconds. Love the interface. the support team was very quick to respond with a minor question I had about one of the ""buy accounts"". this is the ultimate dropshipping system for any website."
"So far so good. We'll see if it helps with the sales. thank you for the easy interface, looking forward to using the app."
"I've been using Revenue Conduit in combination with ActiveCampaign for over a week and I've to say that it has saved me weeks of work! I'm not sure if people realise this is not just a data interface, it's a fundamental framework that helps you structure your global marketing and remarketing campaigns strategy. If you are new to ActiveCampaign YOU SHOULD use RC as you will be operational literally in less than an hour. Their support team is amazing too, very reactive and always looking at making sure your installation is a real success. Keep up the good job Revenue Conduit!"
"I've only downloaded it today (after a lot of research) and I have started setting it up, but so far everything seems great! It is easy to use, the customer support is very helpful and fast, and I really like the customer interface too!"
Does exactly what I need. Simple and easy to use interface. Bonus: you can change how your gallery will display on mobile vs tablet vs laptop which is an awesome feature. I pointed out a bug and the developer fixed it within the day. Awesome!
"Sweet app!  Works perfectly and very easy to configure with a clean interface.  Great job, I give this an A+"
The app is amazing with good dashboard and user interface is great. I t also easily shows analytics of the campaigns!
"I was looking for a way to let customers build their own gift boxes, but didn't want to pay $$$ for a custom interface. This app is exactly the UX I wanted! Plus, the support has been incredibly timely and overdelivered. Highly recommend!"
"I installed Affiliatly a few days ago and have been super impressed with the support I've received thus far. Although the support documentation is extremely thorough, I hit a few snags and received answers to my questions very promptly. The user interface is extremely intuitive and I think we're going to love using this tool in our Shopify store."
"Amazing support, very reactive ! The App is the best we test for bundles, because the interface is very clear, and it needs no code. Customers can compose their bundle directly in a page integrated in your Theme, so that's great !"
"We searched around for a bundle app that would fit our needs and look sleek and professional on our site (we put a lot of emphasis on user experience). After doing the research, we settled on Bundable and we are very pleased. The app allows for a lot of customization so really tailor it to your store and theme. In addition, the developers are incredibly helpful and responsive and have helped us create an even more clean and streamlined bundle to increase sales. They are working a tiered bundle option, which will hopefully be available soon."
"Excellent but short onboarding and the product does what it says. Google page speed dropped a little for desktop, but frankly, it loaded faster in the browser to me. End user experience is improved. I'll take it."
"We absolutely love working with this app developer. First of all, the app has enabled us to create the perfect product bundling option that was exactly what our business needed. But more important than that, every time there has been a feature that I've needed to improve our back-end and user experiences, if it's feasible change, the developer has helped us implement it. This app is a great price for what it has done for our business and the support we get from the team. Highly recommend!"
"Easy to use. Good interface for both the shop owner and affiliate. It's a lot less complicated than larger affiliate programs, but it may take some more work to get sign-ups. Overall, great app."
"Great app. Just as many features as its competitors and far more reasonably priced. Backed by a speedy and hard working customer support team. Clean interface - yes it's not flashy but it is functional and effective, which to me is far more important. Highly recommended."
"Best affiliate program I've seen. 
At first I was a little intimidated by the interface, but once I followed the tutorial everything was clear and I set my program up in just a few hours. In one day I was able to set up my program and set invitations to promoters! The next day I had my first promoter!
I love that there's no limit on the number of referred orders I can have, I love that I can customize it how I please and I love how long the trial is! I'm definitely going to be buying a plan after my trial ends. 
This app is God sent. Definitely recommend."
"It works, but kind of lacking. I tried throwing in a simple logo banner and instructions, but it had some issues displaying in other browsers. Basically, it does have a button that says link generator that's very simple, but it's not graphically intuitive, and for a few bucks more a month, there seems to be better out there for what we need at the moment. Really really wanted to like this App, I think with some tweaks it will be really good, but I think in the end, the affiliates will not be impressed with the lack of having social media sharing interfaces that the other apps have, people like having graphical instructions and simpler interfaces that give them exactly what they want to do without having to figure out or ask for help. I know it's easy to copy a link and paste it, but without being able to easily embed better graphics and instructions on the page itself like the App should have to begin with, I'm unable to do it on my own due to some browser display issues, so unfortunately it's not what we need right now. I'm hoping they'll work on those things and I think they'll have one of the best Affiliate apps out there."
"I really want to use this app. But after several attempts of asking questions and emailing support I have not gotten any assistance on my problem, and this being day 8. I am having problems with my banners and don't have the interface they show on their help page and still no better after removing adBlocker. I really think this can be a great app and wished it worked for me."
"ok, easy to use, but need improvement for better user experience. you can try-it free 7 days, don't worry ;-)"
"Very, clean and understandable interface with option to customize. Customer support is awesome- very and swift even considering the big time difference. Just waiting on the agency platform so we can manage multiple accounts!"
Fantastic app. Has helped us design and deploy some great popups. Easy to use interface and excellent support. Highly recommend.
"Many brands, despite the customer-facing perception of them, really function as small start-ups. In this respect, customer service amongst the various avenues of digital communication that exist today is often handled by a single person. Gorgias has streamlined this role and stripped it of unnecessary burdens and complications in creating a singular platform through which all communication can be customized. Furthermore, by integrating it with Shopify, any customer contact has with it the entire order history, allowing for personalized communication in an instant.
Great app with great functionality, the only downside being the aesthetic of the interface. But that is somewhat negligible when considering its utility."
"I use this app to import customer reviews for items I sell in my shop. I had no problems when integrated this app into my shop. Instructions are easy to follow, and the user interface is near and organised. So far I am very happy with this app."
"Albeit a rather short experience with WisePops, we did notice a great deal of increased activity and user retention on our sites. Very easy to use, comprehensive user interface/experience, especially for someone like myself with limited technical abilities. Furthermore, great customer service with timely responses and appropriate volumes of message for follow-ups. Look forward to see what WisePops can do for us in the future!"
"Wisepops has been awesome - I have tried out almost every e-mail pop-up in the Shopify App store (and some from outside it) and I enjoy their interface, options and performance the most. 
There are a lot of reasons why I think Wisepops outperforms the competition, but I will list a few here: 
- Fantastic + Fair Pricing
- Syncs up perfectly with Mailchimp 
- Ability to target the display scenario and the message that visitors see based on a huge number of factors (referral site, number of visits they've made to your site, exit intent, etc.)
- Ability to customize the pop-up artwork + overlay to your own branding 
- Simple/useful add-ons like a FB like box, a new message that displays after a user signs up, etc). 
There are a few things they could improve, like adding some .psd templates to make the graphic design process easier and improving their user guide (it takes some trial + error to figure out) but for the price, look and simplicity this is your best bet."
"Just started using the app and the interface and pricing seem great. I wanted to order some samples, however, none of my credit or debit cards were accepted. Both VISA and Mastercard are rejected? This doesn't make me feel comfortable about the app or using it for my customers. Contacted customer support and waiting for a response. Anyone else have this issue?"
Absolutely fantastic! So easy to create great videos for your website pages! Clean interface and precise instructions. Highly recommend to anyone looking to add some pizazz to your site.
Simple and easy interface. it gives valuable information for just signing up!
"I’ve been using SPODs app for my store and have had great experiences. I like their selection of products, fast turnaround time and great customer support. All of my apparel washes well and has not distorted or lost form. They have been very good to deal with when there’s been an issue. They are always actively improving the design interface to make the user experience better and I’ve seen huge strides in recent months. The flex print option is awesome and worth the small upgrade for even better quality print. Make sure you join the SPOD Facebook group for additional support as the admin is very quick to respond and get involved with troubleshooting. Let’s be clear, NO POD is perfect but this one tries and understands the needs of us as store owners. Looking forward to future improvements and upgrades from SPOD."
"Cool app, with great customer service, I like how they provide free services, and still care about their user experience."
So easy to make t-shirts. I love being able to add graphics and text right inside your interface. Any member of the team can have fun with it.
"For Facebook pixels, this app has the most user-friendly interface. The features are also all working as expected, the pricing is affordable, and friendly support is there to assist if any questions. I tried other apps, and I can only advise using this one. The best solution for the ios 14 updates."
"I really love SPOD's user interface, it is super easy to use and very compatible with my store! The quality of items they carry is very high, and the printing looks great. The only feature that I wish it had was to bulk import products, and to have multiple products under one listing. I.e., if I wanted one design to be available on 5 different types of shirts, it would be nice if I could have just one product listing with a drop down menu for shirt type as well as size and colour, instead of having to make 5 different products. :) Otherwise, I'm very happy!!"
So far so good! The interface is extremely easy to use and the shopify integration is relatively seamless.
I used this app to create my first product for my store...super easy...actually fun to do! Thanks for user friendly interface!
"This app is fantastic! Really clear and simple interface and easy to share to facebook or even direct to the product page! Highly recommended,"
"Great app, really easy to use and the interface is very simple and straight forward for the customer"
The app is awesome and their Support is just amazingly fast. Keep up! The interface is user friendly and easy to customize.
"I enjoyed how it was really easy to use. The user interface was not confusing.
I didn't have any trouble finding the product I was looking for. Retail price was also clear and I was able to upload my designs with no trouble."
l used this app to help me make some videos with just a few click plus no ads present. Love this app would absolutely recommend it. I enjoyed the clean minimal interface.
Being able to shop Instagram directly in sync with our website really synchronizes the entire process of social media platforms and revenue streaming interfaces. We love this app because it makes shopping a more seamless experience. We highly recommend.
"Cool App, I enjoy every part of the app from it's interface to the integration on the online shop.  I would recommend for a Friend."
"We have been using ShopPad for 3 weeks now and would recommend it to any webmaster especially for ecommerce sites that tend to have heavy load of content, images etc.and thus can benefit the most from a separate mobile optimized.version.
Both designs for smart phone and tablet viewing are clean and minimalist, exactly what we are looking for. They also minimize page load time and render optimized mobile user experience. 
""click a button"" installation and live chat support are very helpful too. And Robert's very knowledgeable and always available when we need help. 
Thumbs up. A must have for all site owners!!"
"If you want customers to shop and buy on the iPad or iPhone, this program is a MUST. The interface is great and the developer is SUPER responsive and very helpful. Most importantly, it looks great and is easy to set up. Highly Recommend to Shopify sites."
"I like the interface of the online store, It is easy to work (specially for some-one that is inexperienced (in setting up a a store)."
"Great app built and managed by the friendliest bunch of people in town. Highly recommended for anyone serious about mobile commerce. Responsive design cannot take care of modern day smart phone shopping. This is a must have app. 
Robert and Janette are always there to guide, help and even customise the mobile interface to match my desktop site. They offer a pleasant contrast to rude, unhelpful people like Tom who owns Troop Digital - a Shopify template maker.
All the more power and luck to Robert and ShopPad. Cheer!"
"Really easy to integrate with main site, and we were fully setup within 24 hours.
Liked the easy way that you can transfer Pages over to mobile, and the Call Now feature is a must.
Had lots of great feedback about the catalogue style of the interface.
Would definitely recommend.
Dan"
"Initial opinion was that this is a brilliant app that allows small businesses create mobile friendly websites with alot of ease. The more i have gotten into it, the more challenging I found simple processes. You can't directly open desktop pages. The app does appear to be glitchy sometimes. ,y biggest pet peeve was the shop url changing completely to ""your-domain.theshoppad.com"". Despite having directing subdomain names to CNAME record, the URL is not changing back. 
On the plus side, the interface on the iPad is especially lovely and I do like the look and feel I was able to create. The iPhone is fine too, though a bit basic. A bit skeptical about this at the moment, but it is definitely worth a try."
This is actually way more awesome than I expected.  The interface is so easy to use and attractive!  The only thing I wish is that you didn't have to upgrade to the highest tier plan to get domain masking.  But I will certainly be upgrading when I have the sales to justify it - I am just starting out.  I highly recommend you try it out!!
"This app offers great features, friendly user interface. I love the function of doing bulk order based on customer tags, that's very helpful for my business. More importantly, their customer service team is amazing, shout out to Stephanie who provided me top-notch support and answer me all the questions of 1st time using this app."
"I really liked the interface for creating announcement bar, the Customer Service was great and the end product was neat as well. Love it"
"Excellent, just what I needed to complete the store and build trust with new customers! Trust is so important for conversion and your app increases that. I love that its easy interface and that it integrates seamlessly. There's nothing I didn't like."
"Definitely recommended. Does exactly what it says on the tin so couldn't ask for much better. Interface is clean, set it and forget it operation, and refreshingly honest and understanding policy when it comes to billing."
"very nice interface - wish there were more free themes of course, but I'm definitely interested in upgrading to nicer premium themes once things (hopefully) start to pick up.  Very easy to set up, the walk-thru is very user-friendly even for idiots like myself!"
Have been using this app for a few years and am very happy with its 'free' features.  Fills our needs.  I would like to be able to position the interface on the page but its nice I can disable it on mobile.
"This app does just what it says it does and provides a much better end-user experience while maintaining visible pages for SEO purposes.  It would be nice if we were able to have the app push down OOS + have a selectable sort order for each collection (perhaps this is possible but we're missing it if so), but otherwise, we are happy and will be keeping the app.  Simple and effective."
"I love this App, I used it before my One Product Store, now I don't need it anymore but liked it very much. The Interface is simple and clean and the advantage for the customer is huge!"
The app works fine but the interface is filled with intrusive ads for the developer's other apps and it does not look or feel professional.
"The app is simple to use and has a great clean interface.
The support team goes well above and beyond. They are super responsive and so polite. Very rare that I see a support team this good!"
"Just what I needed to get more products in my niche, in addition the support team was great and responsive. User interface is ok but I hope they will add option for bulk import in the future."
"Great and very prompt service! The browser interface can sometimes be cofnusing, but these are the perfect partners for whatsapp marketing!"
tried this app found it good and nice interface and good for beginners. also the support staff is good
"Bulk Discount Code Generator is a great, easy to use app.  We don't say this often, but we couldn't be anymore pleased with this app.
⚫ We're able load 10,000 discount codes at a time with no issues and no limit.  We were able to simply copy an paste our codes into the app.
⚫ The app even estimated for us how long the load would take Shopify to integrate (a couple minutes) and told us when we had accidentally loaded duplicate codes (great feature.)
⚫ We ran this app through its paces, testing it with virtually every discount control option Shopify offers for discount codes - this app passed with flying colors.  No issues.
⚫ We found the apps features & interface blend seamlessly into Shopify - we wouldn't know it wasn't part of Shopify if we hadn't added it ourselves.
⚫ Finally, We received terrific support from Seguno, the company that developed this - we're checking out their other Shopify apps now."
Very straightforward interface and gets the job done. No point in paying for other apps unless you need more advanced features. Thank you Seguno!
"Once I realised that the official Shopify bulk discount app had vanished, I quickly turned to this one. The interface is far superior to the Shopify one, and it works quickly and effectively. 100% recommended. There's no need to pay for one of the stupidly priced other ones."
Great App with a user friendly interface. Support was very responsive to a couple of queries I had about the App Permissions. Ideal replacement to Shopify's now discontinued Bulk Discount Generator.
"We tested it out and have decided to hold off on this app for the following reasons:
1. No customer credit capability.  We need a way to give customers credit in their account.  This will also help us tie in our online store with the POS by allowing customers to redeem their credit either via the website or in store using the POS system.
2. No way to exchange products
   Update:  Shoppify POS support told us that exchanged can be made, however, it really isn't an exchange at all.  We will have to manually refund the items for exchange to a store credit, complete the order, THEN repurchase the new items with the store credit.  So really, Shopify POS still does not support exchanges.  I have not been able to verify this as our trial ran out.  
3. No way to assign product cost to each product, thus making it impossible to keep track of inventory cost.
   Update: Support staff informed us that the app DeepMine has the ability to assign cost to each product and variation.  Although this is A solution, this basic feature really should be built right into the the product information as an extra attribute in the first place.  We have paid for DeepMine in order to assign costs to our products, however, it is still in beta state, and the interface is a huge pain in the ass to use.
4. Unable to assign customers to customer groups for predefined discount rates.
5. No visible notes field for each customer that is visible before clicking in to the customer's profile.  This needs to be visible on the same screen when displaying a search result of customers.
6. Super clumsy interface.  Image size needs to be customizable to allow for much smaller image.  Also, the POS system needs to provide a No Image option, that displays a top down alphabetical list.
7. Cost is too high for a product this basic.
We didn't have time to explore this app further as there were too many features missing in the app for us to put the efforts in to fully testing it out.  Hope the app is completed with these features so that we can switch over from another platform."
"*This app had an update which fixed several of my major issues with it, so I've revived this review*
This is a solid and much needed addition to the Shopify platform. Its very usable, it requires almost no training to figure it out, is easily integrated into the store. I think the layout could have a few tweaks to make it more seamless (refreshing the selected collection when you start a new order and perhaps making it easier to select collections for example) but overall its pretty fast to use, and wont cause much of a headache.
There are a few reasons why I haven't given this a higher rating, firstly is that its expensive. We already pay a premium price for backend hosting of our store, really this is a $49 a month fee simply to process offline transactions. Really its a premium price for a basic product.
The app has some limitations, reports on the app are non existent, other than a sales tally. That means you have no way of knowing how many of a particular product has been sold, how much you've made each hour, how much from different collections you've sold. Theres a lot of useful information that you should have access to on the fly, but you don't unless you use the computer interface. 
The use of printers/ scanners and till drawers is limited to only very specific models. This no doubt makes the installation of the physical POS assets easy and very reliable, however unless you live in North America the receipt printers and till drawers aren't really readily available, so you have to buy a more expensive version off eBay, which is disappointing. Even the inclusion of AirPrint would be very welcome.
The ability to see product descriptions in the app would also be useful, often if you sell a large amount of products, someone might have a questions which you cant readily answer, but having that information available to you would be very useful.
Ultimately its very useful. It is a real timesaver when it comes to updating quantities manually which is really its most redeeming feature. I don't think its quite equal to the $600 a year price you have to pay, its not really a complete system yet, but I suspect it might be after a few big updates."
I wonder if shopify is interested in manipulate Multiple Inventory and also Store Transfers! This would be really helpful! The User experience is great! you need to work more on the inventory stuff!
"I really like this interface and is something I have been hoping for. Stripe needs to go though with taking over the whole site.  A week to get paid and won't let us ecig merchants sell online. I'd rather use Square for the POS app and let my cc processor run the site. If I decide to keep it, I'll just except square via its own app running a separate cc scan in Square."
"Better Reports has an exceptional customer service. Whatever you need, they'll be there for you as they truly care about your business. Apart from that, their app user experience and its capabilities is everything I needed."
"I only just loaded this new App into my Shopify store so it's early days, but so far, the interface seems quite intuitive. I had some trouble understanding the process for linking Amazon SKUs to my Shopify SKUs but the chat rep was quick and thorough and pointed me in the right direction."
This is a wonderful App! I love all the features and customizations. It works very well and adds to the user experience. Thank you.
I just downloaded this app and wow this is amazing! I already love the user interface and can't wait to play around with it more.
sharan has been extrememly helpeful! really great customer experience anythign that i dont understand he has helped me to understand and works with me on a 1 to 1 with the same vision to get the app live and best user experience
"Amazing app. The interface makes a lot of sense, easy and flexible. Stores with traffic can easily improve their traffic roas with this tool. The team helped me set my font and some other css adjustment within a day. very responsive"
I really loved working with team tapcart. The app is so user friendly and easily intergratible. This app is not only visually appealing but creates a unique user experience. Thank You team tapcart. This app is a definite must!!
"Superb customer service. Interface is so easy to use and so many customizations to choose from. Overall, I would recommend this app to those who want to have an app for their shopify store."
"A great out of the box app experience. Such a beautiful interface, not to mention a seamless functionality. I will say however that both teams have to work well together and be willing to put in the time to create a next level app. Thankfully, the team members at Tapcart are willing to put in the time & effort for an app of high caliber. They are superstars and we are thankful!"
"Amazed at what this app development team was able to do! As a rapidly growing e-commerce apparel company we were very hesitant about opening the door to an app as we are incredibly protective of our branding and User Experience. We needed to make sure that the app reflected the vision of our website. Integration was seamless, app was up and running in no time and can't say enough about the quality of the end product! Intuitive and incredibly easy to navigate and make changes. It is safe to say that even our high expectations were exceeded. Thanks guys!"
"The team at tapcart is nothing short of amazing! They are US-based, answer the phones, respond to emails, and go far above and beyond to insure the optimal user experience. As a seasoned marketer, I have dealt with a plethora of software companies in my day and tapcart has been the best of the best, exceeding all of my expectations. Their execution is impeccable and there are no lags or delays. If there is an issue they fix it right away; no waiting. The app itself is clean straightforward and easy to customize and edit. Again, if you need anything the team at tapcart is there to get it done for you. I will most certainly use tapcart again and give them the highest recommendation to anyone who needs an app!"
"Really great experience. Our account manager is very responsive and answered all our questions very quickly. We just launched our App but overall, the customer service is great and the interface really easy to use! Highly recommend!"
"Does exactly what it says, gives you better reports. Great app with a great support team, easy to use interface."
"Great service and support. The newly added evaluation page is very nice and durable. And it is an adaptive interface, which is very friendly to various users. The service team also solved the problem very promptly and patiently. thank"
"Perfect app for me! I used to have 1 multilanguage shop, but to take things to the next level I seperated them into 2 stores. I use this app so sync all my products stock between my English and Dutch shop. Easy setup and very good interface!"
This app does exactly what I wanted with a nice and clean interface. Overall I am really satisfied with this app.
"Just setting up the app! After looking for many apps for our Affiliate Program, this one was the one that catch our attention because of its easy and intuitive user interface. Hope this works great for us. Once we began to use it, I'll write my updated review. So far so good, it seems to be a very complete and robust app."
I use this interface to promote my business. easy to use. I can promote my business with ease. i've tried other apps but this is the best by far
"So far so good, I'm in the middle of set up but am finding it to be a lot more user friendly that the last one I tried. Seems to be a very easy to use interface."
Really good well built app! I would love to use it. I ultimately needed it to track the affiliate links as the same discounts as the codes but that required the $70 a month plan. That amongst other features in the professional plan are free on Goaffpro with just a slightly less good interface to manage the affiliates. --- If the $22 plan included all the discount and tracking features I would switch to UpPromote. -- After trying; if you are large scale I do recommend this app on one of the 2 top tier subscriptions.
very fast and knowledgeable support. Easy to understand interface. Does what it says it would. Thank you.
Optimised our store perfectly and it never disappointed us. Great and easy interface as well. Thanks :)
"Easy setup. Easy to use. Interface was very intuitive and I completed in in 15 minutes. I still have some questions for the admin, but the set was quite easy."
"The app is great and definitely an upgrade from any of the previous Amazon apps used in the past. Their support team, especially Keterson, is very knowledgeable, patient, & helpful. The only thing I'd say is that even with the tutorials provided to explain setup, it's still a bit difficult to do on your own. There's also A LOT of functionality so it can be overwhelming at times looking at the interface."
"La meilleure interface entre Shopify et Amazon que l'on puisse imaginer. La prise en main est loin d'être simple mais de très très loin la plus simple des possibilités offertes par Amazon. Conscient de ces complications, le support est super disponible pour vous accompagner dans la prise en main, la création et la gestion de vos offres."
Seems like a good interface and some functionality on the free version. However it broke my cart process and meant people couldn't check out.
"We are using this app for the last couple of months. We switched from another app because they were too slow to add connection to new marketplaces. Maybe because I was used to another interface, it took me around 1 week to get used to this app. Even though it took time to get used to, the app worked very good from the beginning. I learned about some options and functions in the following days.
The customer service is also top quality. I always received replies quickly and problems have been solved, except one case but we concluded that the problem is not due to the app."
"This app has massive potential - I like the ideas it has and the interface it uses.
The problem is each thing I tried to do with it didn't work and I had to contact the support each time. I do not have time to wait around for fixes for rudimentary functions.
The product search function responded to every word in the term rather than the whole phrase, meaning a simple 3 word product title search would return every product matching one of the 3 words. The devs did make changes to this within 24 hours which was good, but it shouldn't have been an issue to begin with. It can only search via title, not via SKU.
The critical issue was a sale wouldn't respond to changes, leaving a default animation on discounted prices firstly which I didn't want. I then tried to turn the sale off and it wouldn't turn off at all. This is a big, potentially costly bug in my view, and if something like this exists this app should not be on this app store yet - no matter charging customers for it. I disabled and removed the app shortly after to resolve the issue.
The app also does not change prices in the ""compare at"" field within Shopify itself, rather it creates a discount code which is applied in the Shopify, causing knock-on effects with other apps or automated collections, as well as PayPal and Google checkouts. This is logical but should be considered within the setup of your store."
"Easy to use. Clean, nice-to-use interface that makes me enjoy doing my job. Extremely clear documentation with well-written tutorials. Doesn't slow down my website speed at all and gets the job done quickly. Super amazing and friendly customer support team. And all at a reasonable price. Thanks, Locksmith!"
"Honestly, while I had some odd issues I was mostly able to resolve them myself with the simple interface which is straight forward and functional.
When I did contact support for an issue I couldn't fix they were super fast and helpful and were able to resolve it within a day.  I have to hand it to you guys that alone is worth the 5-star rating.  Thanks a bunch!
I really hope you guys continue to improve this application it's been very helpful."
"This is such a good app. It basically takes all the emails Shopify generates, for whatever reason, and provides templates for each of them. They all have the same look and feel - they're linked, so if you change something within the app, all the templates change (a colour or font, whatever) - and all are indivdually editable so you really have no excuse to have Beautiful Branded Consistent  Store emails. Great user experience. If you care about the way your store is presented to customers in emails - you need this app."
"Without this app, I don't think we would have been able to list our products on Amazon at all! It really seems to do everything we would need it to. Although the interface is a bit confusing at first, there are plenty of guides/FAQs/videos included that helped us figure out how to get things set up. Additionally, the customer support is EXCELLENT and is really what sets this apart from most other apps: Olivier really goes above and beyond to help you out if you reach out with a question about how to achieve something, and he even made tweaks to the app based on some issues we were running into with the app and even added in extra functionality (like background image removal!). He also extended our free trial until we were able to get the app working as we needed to."
Free automatic invoicing as well as a really good invoice building interface. Other apps cahrged $30 once you started sending a certain amount. this app is great
Excellent support and really great invoicing application for small businesses! The interface is client and seamlessly integrates with Shopify.
"Absolutely transforms the post purchase and direct contact from the shopify interface.
Possibly the best investment we've made when it comes to providing the professional polish we need.

The email templates look great and really boost the quality of transactional emails. Very easy to modify and copy over to Shopify. The interface for setting up all of the templates is very easy to use. Highly recommend!
Affordable price for super amazing job compared to others. Great & simple user experience with great downloadable email list. Job well done.
"Fantastic app!  Templates are beautiful (and it's great that it's a one-off charge), so easy to use, matches the Shopify interface and overall just fantastic.  Easy to use, great prompt helpful support as well. Highly recommended, such a boost for our store's emails."
"Holy crap, this app solved so many headaches for me!
I can create free versions of products that don't show up in 'All Products' or store Search results, without touching any code.
I also plan to use this app for product versions only visible to Wholesale customers.
The language, care and vibe present in the App's presentation and interface adds a nice human touch, too.
Brilliant work folks! A++++
Love,

The best Shopify app to customize the cart drawer. Really increase the AOV and provide a good user experience
Great customer service. They quickly answer my questions. App was very easy to setup. Helps me restrict purchasing of high demand products to my VIP customers. very flexible and easy to use interface.
"I tried out several email customizing apps, and when I finally installed OrderlyEmails, I thought, ""Wow! This is what a Shopify app should look like!""
First of all, the user interface is familiar. It's just like customizing the shop's theme. I didn't have to waste any time figuring out what to do.
The Magic Designer imported our shop's colors, fonts, and styles in few seconds and applied them to the templates. Switching between emails, moving, removing, adding, and customizing sections was simple. Setting up all of our transactional emails took about twenty minutes.
I appreciate that it works with Kit to customize the Recommended Product section and that the analytics are integrated into the admin's built-in marketing reports.
My only gripe is that the Account Invite template does not allow a Recommended Product section to be added. I figured out a workaround, but it would be great if that was changed in a future update."
Best app we've added to our site. Initially downloaded to try GWP and ended up replacing an Up-Sell/Cross-Sell app. The interface is VERY easy to use and doesn't have the frustrating limitations we ran into with the other app. The customer service team and knowledge is unparalleled. The speed and accuracy of their team is impressive.
"It's helpful, the interface isn't the prettiest but it does its job perfectly. Recommend, Recommend."
"This app requires some significant setup time and testing, but once we got that done, the app has worked great. The few glitches that we've run into have been addressed promptly and thoroughly by the development team, and they've even accommodated us with a custom feature we needed. The interface is perfect for teams wanting a highly-customized portal and dynamic features. It's made the returns process so much more streamlined and organized. We're very happy."
"Bottom line: This app is great and the support during setup of your channel and use is superb.
I installed this app to connect with Google Shopping Actions so I could sell my work via the Google Express Store. Note, GSA is different than Google Shopping, which you can do with Shopify, although now that I have this app, I don’t need the Shopify Google channel since this app is covering my feed for all parts of Google. I used the free trial first, then subscribed. I have to say the support I received from Max was probably the best from any place ever. He helped me get my GSA feed set up every step of the way - and this was during the FREE trial period. You need to get your store and products approved by Google to be on GSA, and as anyone knows, it can be painful trying to work with Google “support”. To help, Max worked with GSA support to figure out why they were “stuck” in processing my approved store. He worked with them on other issues as they came up from Google. Note, these were not Shopping Feed app issues, these were issues on Google’s side of things. 
As for the app - it’s great. You are able to look at and work with the feed pulled from your store so that what you want ends up going through to your channel (in my case, GSA). I thought the user interface was easy to figure out. Another good thing is that although they schedule when your feed will be updated and processed every day (or multiple times a day), you can manually force a new update to your feed or force it to re-process the feed data if you’ve made some changes. 
Honestly, I can’t say enough good things about this app and working with Max. It is a pleasure working with him. This is the first app I’ve left a review for, because I felt like I really had to call them out for their excellent work. 
Truly a gem in the app store."
Our store had been on an older up-sell app and the team at ReBuy went above on a beyond to help with the migration over to this. The interface is super intuitive. We see a significant increase in AOV using ReBuy.
"Beautiful, streamlined interface and super easy to set up. I also received amazing support when I needed to change some wording. Highly recommend."
"I have been looking for a returns app that can manage returns, accommodate exchanges, and is simple to use. I have used and reviewed several, and none were perfect - they either lacked functionality, were very complex or cumbersome to use, or were too expensive for my small business. ReturnGo looked promising, so I gave it a try. I am very glad that I did because it is exactly what I need. The interface is simple to use both from the admin and end user; there are several return options that can be implemented & adjusted as needed. Most of all, the support team is fantastic and very responsive. I had adjustments I wanted to make to work for my specific setup and the team has replied quickly, resolved all my questions, and implemented solutions that work for me. Highly recommended, I will definitely keep it in my store."
"Super easy to set up, nice interface. Looking forward to seeing results hit the shopping carts. Developers answered my questions very quickly, very happy so far."
"It took 4 months of consistent effort from our end and the shopping feed support end to have our feeds in order. Andy had to get involved, and we had to really persevere. Why did we stick at it? Here's why:
1. I have tried every single app that does feeds via shopify and this app is the best by a long mile
-- Most flexibility with listing settings
-- Supports ebay templates
-- Supports 2 way ebay order syncing
-- Allows you to export the feed and manually create your own with google shopping (which is what we ended up doing)
-- Supports most Australian marketplaces
-- Has a good way of dealing with multi-SKU issues
2. Other apps have far poorer support / do not care (especially godatafeed) - and have really poor interfaces, and are not as committed to improvement
3. Sopify / marketplace integrations are pivotal to success of your store without this, you are walking on one leg. And the pain is worth it to get a setup that you dont touch for a little while after setting up
4. I am now a feed expert (especially with Google shopping feeds
Completely understand some of the negative reviews here, but I can also see how a bit (or a lot) of effort in our case is worthwhile in the long run
B"
"I use this app since a week, and it is great for user experience! Every exchange or refund request is converted into Shopify! The best thing is to have the opportunity to chat with the support for any question. They are super nice and take a lot of comments in consideration. They work hard to add future improvements, and propose always better. I recommend 300% !!

"This app is aweful - I don't know how Shopify have even allowed it to be added to the App Store.
The setup was asking me to confirm which fields are colours, sizes or 'other'.  After doing this and then clicking save I was brought back to the top of the page I was on but did not get a confirmation message that the information was saved, advised that I should now go to another option on the nav bar or if another page should appear during the setup process.
After clicking on the 'add account' I was then taken to another page to create an account (even though I had already done this) and could not proceed past this page as the 'optional' VAT field insisted I needed to enter a VAT number.  As a UK company does not need to be VAT registered this cannot be the case...and the field was marked as optional.
This is a terrible app and the developers need to look at improving the user experience during the setup stage."
"I always liked omnisend due to the easy interface, but their prices have gone up and the analytics are lacking compared to other platforms. However, their customer service is faaaar superior than their biggest competitors and it's very very hard to leave a service that is so willing to help you with the smallest issues."
I am only using the free version of USB but it has an easy to use interface that displays your changes on the right-hand side of the screen. I found it really helps to visualise the changes being made without having to save and click elsewhere to view the update.
"Drew and Shopping Feed have been fantastic - very well organized, and provided excellent support above and beyond the norm.  The app is the easiest we've seen on Shopify app marketplace in terms of syncing up all of your different sales streams/channels (Amazon, eBay, Sears, Houzz, etc.).  Pretty intuitive in using the interface, so major plus.  
The SF team has so far answered all my questions very promptly and thoroughly, even with the 3 hour time difference between the coasts.  I would highly recommend this app and the developers behind it.  There seem to be regular updates as well, so it can only get better.  I hope in the near future it can sync up with other sales channels like Rakkuten, OpenSky and Bonzanza, but that's just where I also sell/plan to sell.  Get this and get started!"
Great front-end user experience for my customers and support was great in adding an extra level of customisation.
"Support from Lottie and Cecillia are superb! Swift and fully understand what customer means. Live chat support help out lots faster. 
Migrating and set up everything just took me an hour from start to launch!
Interface was easy to use and understand, analysis dashboard is pack with information"
Real easy to use app with a very great looking interface. Customer service is tremendous.
"So far so good! I like the interface, and the well thought out logic behind the rules. And the most important thing - intelligent, thoughtful and accommodating support!"
"Great App, few pennies extra - but its worth,  seamless integration, amazing user experience for login, good support team!"
"By far the best profit tracking tool I've come across. This app gave me such a clear understanding of my financials. I check the dashboard multiple times a day and often gain valuable insights into where my weak points are in remaining / increasing profitability. Setup is incredibly easy and the user interface is very clean but also packed with useful information. The support / development staff are also super friendly and responsive. They've happily looked into and solved any issues I've had with my data. I've tried a few profit tracking apps before I tried BeProfit and none of them compare in the slightest. The team at BeProfit deserve congratulations on their achievement. If you're looking to get a more complete understanding of your numbers, this is the app for you."
"Really useful and simple app to start to understand my profit as a business, definitely recommend! The interface is really great too, which is rare for apps like this."
"Amazing App and awesome customer support! This app really helps us make our site look great without knowing html and easy to use. Great functionality and user interface to make great looking pages for your website. 
Highly recommend!"
Really great interface and seamless integrations with everything. This is the only app I've found that can successfully track Shopify and Paypal fees.
"I was skeptical since it is FREE. However, it has exceeded our expectations. Gives you the key metrics at a glance. The interface is user friendly. I needed a minor change and tech support responded quickly and made the change. First-class product."
"Best Profit and Loss App I've ever used!
I was struggling to calculate my 2020 profit and loss. I was lost in COGS, PayPal, Shopify payouts, shipping fees, recurring payments etc. I was even trying to keep everything in an Excell file until I found BeProfit! These guys saved my life. The app is highly user-friendly, sync very fast, pulling all the information successfully, and providing you valuable information in a sleek interface. I can't say enough to explain the benefits that you will get from this app. Don't think so much, just install and see it, you won't regret it!
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!"
Love Page Studio!  It's the only program that's allowed me to create my Brand Ambassador page and easily edit existing pages.  The interface is super user friendly and they have excellent support.  Worth every penny!!
Worked perfect right out of the box. Highly recommend it to any e-commerce store owner. Great value and interface.
"I love this app. I stopped using the Facebook Channel by Shopify and started to use this app. This is the best decision if you really want to sell on Facebook and Instagram. The setup process is easy enough for my 13 year old to understand and setup. The support is fantastic. The support walks you through all the settings and explain each feature. They make sure the products are properly uploaded to Facebook and they help with the catalog, business manager and commerce manager. You do not need to have technical skills to be able to use the app. The interface is very user friendly and very easy to navigate. Everything there is very easy and simply to do. Now I can focus on growing our Facebook business while having a dedicate support team that is always availble and ready to help. They will help you each step of the way. I would recommed this app for anyone or business looking to sell on Facebook or Instagram. This is the real deal."
Very good UX interface. Easy to use and works perfectly. I had a few questions when integrating with FaceBook and customer service was outstanding! Fixed everything in minutes.
"I was really hoping to be able to use this app to provide a better user experience for my customers using automatic discount codes. Unfortunately, we never got it to work despite implementing recommended steps by Tabarnapp. A bit of a disappointment and a giant waste of time."
"today i discovered another bug in the app if the customer selects 2items and goes to cart but what if he decides to add another item from the cart page selector to buy 3 items total he will do so and click right away the checkout button.....well the app will not work even if i dont have any other app interfering in the cart page!!! he will need to refresh the page and wait until that congrats discount pop up comes out in a few seconds wich is amazingly anti user experience so he can have his new quantity discount applied....bottom line he must be aware that he needs to go slowly and refresh each time he changes his mind!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Not mentioning the paypal express button..........!!!
Support team do sth!"
"Interface is a little confusing, but once you figure it out, it works great!"
"super easy to install ad use. great app. great support. recommended. installed, interfaced, ready and used in 5 minutes"
"easy to use,  simply  to activate. 
the interface is simple and very pretty     
Just i don't like the fact that  the rate is an obligation  
i can't enjoy the app without make this damn preview"
"Truly a new type of provider in shopify has come! Gelato has great direct and quick email support - which was valuable since my main need was printed books with rainforest photos I get in my explorations. I ordered a sample book I made and me and my family WERE IMPRESSED. It was like being in the forest. This is a wip and they are in contact with me about it. I am now looking at their other products. I was surprised about the founder statement - that they are a SOFTWARE company that improves and interfaces with thousands of print providers all over the world. This is awesome. My suggestions is to look closely at other POD's like printify, printful and gooten and get some ideas from their approach. Each has something unique and helpful - like in Printify I can copy a product and then edit into a new one by changing the image - good for a group of similar products! With this i choose a topic - like the pillows now in www.yunque.store - most are a template I copied since most are Hubble telescope images. Did all that in 2-3 hours - 18 new pillow products in the store! As an example for canvas they allow multiple sizes at the same times, and then tell you what sizes is the provided image a good fit. Normally i make 3 canvas sizes, this is one design vs making 3 separate designs for each canvas size. Most POD's have this feature. To finish 5-stars is a low score - your business deserves more!"
"Super smooth interface and have all the functions you could need in an affiliate program! 
I was struggling with the setup but Jennifer from their live chat support guided me through it. It works perfectly!"
"Amazing platform, they make it as easy as possible for both the merchant and affiliates. the interface is just beautifully design and not to mention their support team is very responses, literally get questions answered in 30 seconds from the in app chat feature they have."
Very quick and responsive customer service. Good app for reaching affiliates. sleek interface too
New to learning the system and its quite easy to use! Very smooth interface that is easily manageable! The best part is their amazing customer service! A huge thank you to Jennifer Goodman for being there when we needed her! She was very knowledgeable about the questions I was asking her and sent me links for easy direction to the pages I needed! LeadDyno really did a great job hiring her! Kuddos to you Jennifer!
"Overall happy and will use again.
Installation: 5/5 easy (requires some knowledge of code) if you need help they get it done quickly for you!
App interface: 4.5/5 easy to use (missing a couple key features, but they have a workaround for most) 
Customer Support: 4/5 They do not answer the phone! I would give 3 stars for this , but the saving grace was very friendly help through email and chat. (5/5 response time by email/chat) 
Other: Our template also used jquery that they didn't support, and they fixed it for us. I'm very pleased they took care of this for us :)"
"Listen, if you're anything below an expert at this whole email marketing thing - I suggest starting out with this app! It's simple yet robust enough to cover more than the basics! I've tried more email marketing companies then I care to admit - and this is the first one I've really taken action with! Part of that is their simple interface & quick tutorials on Youtube! Thanks SmartrMail, I hope you're able to continue on & expand your offerings!"
"I looked through many apps and as a small business, this app fitted my needs. I created a discount pop up, which works perfectly and an email to my customers. This was my first attempt and the interface was very intuitive. All working well."
Really great app to work with. Easy and fast customer service. The user experience is just a lot better when having this app
"Excellent application, it gave an extra touch to my website. I have to applaud the truly exceptional assistance, it solved some visual interface problems for me. Thanks! Advise. Applicazione ottima, ha dato un tocco in più al mio sito internet. Devo fare un plauso all' assistenza veramente eccezionale, mi ha risolto alcuni problemi visivi di interfaccia. Grazie! Consiglio."
"Incredible app! The interface is intuitively clear.  It has everything I need. No bugs, no dificulties in setting up. Simple manual for users. Support 10/10!!"
"Clean looking interface, really user friendly and Nadeem who helped with the widget design was a legend! Thanks for creating such a great app! :-)"
Excellent. i recomment to everyone. Very Easy interface and free app. You show your message to your custumer with this app
"The app is super helpful for individual interfaces. It is easy to use and simple to understand. You can choose between the different types of export and test the export directly in the program. If you have any questions or need help developing an interface, Lukasz from Exporteo Support is always professional and offers his support. He works solution-oriented and quickly finds a way to solve the problem. I can only recommend everyone to try Exporteo."
"I just started using this app but the customer service has been absolutely fantastic, they are so quick to respond, help and resolve. The interface is good. I downloaded this app after trying others, I like eprolo pod so much better, friendly to beginners."
"Easy to use, simple interface, and FREE! This has been the banner app I needed to improve the overall esthetic for my site."
j'adore je recommande franchement gratuite et puissante elle propose une interface professionnelle digne d'un service payant
good User interface. not bad for free plan but highly recommended even though paid plan without experiencing free plan
Easy app to learn. Selections are a bit old user experience but it gets the job done. Keep enhancing the app please! I'm always interested in new functionality.
"The app is really easy to use. uploading of designs is quite trouble free. fair pricing and Friendly user interface, Everything about this app makes me smile :)"
My friend recommended me this app for my new POD business. The user interface is really helpful and easy to use. I had few issues while using but thanks to Rick for great support
"App is great, really easy to use, got a great account manager that is super responsive and helpful. I don't remember having any trouble with set-up if I did, Nicol the account manager helped me through it. Interface is easy to use and relatively straightforward."
"This was the only app I found on the store that asks customers for their Zipcode on entry to the store, while keeping availability of products different for different pincodes. However, the app had poor instructions on how to set it up, and could not upload the large set of zipcodes (all across India) that I needed for my website. When I couldn't do so on the app, I contacted their customer care. I sent them a list of >29000 zipcodes that needed to be added. They told me they had all been added, yet when I tested on the website many zipcodes from important cities had not been added. Their app interface doesn't allow me to export all added zipcodes, so I couldn't even find out for myself which ones got missed. I clearly articulated to their support team why I needed their back-end support to resolve the problem.
Over 5 days of talking to them, they could not resolve my problem, and told me to solve it myself.
Luckily, I found another app that did what I need, and I was able to set up in under 30 minutes."
"We've used a lot of different apps for 3PL and shipping for our online stores across UK, Europe, HK, and Australia, and Easyship by far has the best interface and swift integration with our eCommerce platforms. Shipping rates are always very good, so there are excellent savings too."
"We started using this app and it seemed great interface wise. The canadian courier prices were pretty high so it wasnt giving us the lowest rates, shopify shipping was still cheaper even though it states we get discounted rates. I've been trying to add our custom Canada post courier account, and its been like pulling teeth, the support team keeps giving me the run around.. and literally in the middle of a live chat session the support person said they had to run to a meeting and ended the chat.. so unprofessional.. what a waste. The platform is good but that is easily the worst support Ive come across and I have seen some bad ones."
"Excellent user experience and simple interface, also support is always ready to help with any problems."
"This app is great for all-round website SEO, and the interface is really easy to use/navigate. The support is also quick and fantastic!"
"Once the popup is setup through the app's website, the popups look fine, but the interface to set up the popups is very buggy and modifying an existing popup is pretty bad."
"我在shopify上面试验了5个相关SEO的插件（免费版本），这一款是性价比最高而且质量也相当靠谱。 我是中文用户所以我会用中文和英语一起。这款SEO无论对于新手还是像我这样的前市场工作人员（接触过SEO SEM）都是相当容易上手和易于掌握的。免费版本足够一般的商家使用如果不依靠线上引流为主要目的的话，但是付费版（我现在就是付费版本） 你知道的 真的是良心价而且真的好用。 相信我，只要你认真看过相关的入门文章并且认真操作了，你的商店绝对会排在Google首页。 它真的值得5颗星。 如果非要说什么改进意见的话，他们的界面UI实在是很一般，但是我无所谓我觉得他们把主要的心思都用在如何更好的改进SEO上面了，这相当不错。 I have tried 5 SEO related plugins on shopify (free version) and this one is the most cost effective and quite reliable in quality. I am a Chinese user so I will use Chinese and English together. This SEO is quite easy to use and easy to master for both newbies and ex-marketers like me (who have been exposed to SEO SEM). The free version is good enough for general business use if you don't rely on online traffic as the main purpose, but the paid version (I am now the paid version) you know is really conscientious price and really good. Believe me, if you read the introductory article and do it carefully, your store will definitely rank on the first page of Google. It really deserves 5 stars. If I have to say any improvement, their interface UI is really general, but I don't care I think they put the main thought on how to improve SEO, which is quite good."
"What a useful app to help us find the best solutions for shipping our orders. We can sort by the lowest rate or the fastest, and the interface is pretty easy to use.
I just wish the site were better optimized for mobile!"
"The interface takes a while to get used to but once you do, it is a really great tool! This app really made my life so much easier with its variety of couriers and ease of use. What I especially like is how all the product info is automatically synced from my store so that the customs information and addresses are auto-filled into the shipping label for me. All I have to do is download the labels and print them. 
I particularly appreciate the support that I received, whenever I had problems it was super easy to get help quickly. I would say this app has given me one of the best customer service experiences I have ever received, with how accommodating and helpful they were. I hope to keep using this as my store grows!"
"Even though the operations interface needs time to study at the very beginning, the setup can be completed in reasonable time.  It's handy as there's no need to re-input information like logo but addresses.
A fantastic team to make the logistic processes streamlined.  Make the selection choices of courier services more versatile and effective.  Improve efficiency in shipping to various locations around the globe !
Thanks from tulips.com.hk"
Easyship has allowed us to take control of our shipping with an easy to use interface.  We can now offer shipping options to our customers based on cost and time and overall our delivery times have improved significantly. Customer service is also amazing. Tracking details are very detailed and easy to access and resend to customers when they experience issues with a courier or a delivery. Thank you Easyship!
"The customer service is the best compared to any other Shopify app I have used. Their customer service replies in minutes 24 hours a day (from my experience). I am in the UK and I have ask them questions at 5pm, and 5am, and they have replied in minutes. Speedily, Phat even did coding for me to remove YouTube URL box and changing the format of the Reviews to suit my theme. Plus Phat noticed a little error (I made) and asked me if it was intended, which it was not, and helped me to fix it. So Judge.me goes the extra mile to help. The user experience of the app can be daunting at first, but it is incredibly easy once you get the hang of it (which was only several minutes - I can be incredibly impatient, so my first impressions can be dramatic). I usually use LOOX reviews, because it includes photo and video reviews, but Judge.me does, too and it is a cheaper plan ($9.99 a month compared to $39 LOOX)."
"The support of the app is bespoke. Customer service is doing their job very well! However, I find the whole interface quite difficult to operate."
I am switching from Loox to this app. The interface is easy and I only need some of the features. Loox is just too many resources.
"Simple, effective, and a must have for any e-Commerce store. Their algorithm extracts valuable tracking from carriers that you couldn't get on other platforms and the interface is one-of-a-kind! Definitely a winner!"
"Good app so far. Simple interface makes it easy to navigate to the tabs I need. The system is straightforward, set rules and Cart Guru takes care of the activity. 
Update: Had some problems at first getting the rules set. Worked with Leo on their team and he's helping me get through it. Also had a chat with Ivi their customer success manager and she's helping create templates and strategies to test. They take good care of their customers."
"Our online store ( punkston.com ) uses Judge.me APP, This is a very COOL review APP, both user experience, and technical support, are worthy of your use"
"I just ran my first waiting list campaign, and it was a huge success. Not only is it very easy to use, but it is implemented in such a way that it leverages the Shopify infrastructure in every possible way, working seamlessly with all other apps and workflows I already have in place. Most strings are externalized so they can be translated into *multiple* languages, and the sign-up accounts are the standard store accounts to make the user experience seamless. The developer is very quick to respond to questions, and offers thorough responses. I am very happy with this app, and look forward to further enhancements in the future. Great app!"
Nice interface and install and preinstall was easy with the wizard that was displayed on left-hand size.
"A super useful app at an affordable, and worthwhile, price. The installation is simple, the admin interface is easy to understand. I LOVE the service this type of app provides, as it helps inform our inventory purchases, and the support team has been super responsive with questions. 
The ONLY downside is that you have to manually visit your admin site to see if people have signed up for reminders to products - I don't really understand why apps like these don't notify you (the store owner) when customers have signed up to be notified when products are in stock. Even something like a weekly digest email would suffice. When that functionality happens, this will easily be a 5-star app of awesome.
Cheers."
Simply the best app I've come across to run a variety of discounts and offers on my Shopify site. The interface is intuitive (recently updated) and their support team has always promptly solved any issues and answered all my questions. You can install this one without thinking twice!
"As my follower count grows, it's hard to track new followers, and extinguish who are the relevant ones. Carro's interface is incredible, and we can't wait for new futures to be released. Keep up and good luck!"
"Great user experience and great functionality. I love what Carro offers and I love how easy the team is to access if I have any questions. Great concept, great delivery."
"After trialling several CMS systems we've settled in and paid for this one. Really pleased with it. Sleek interface, easy to set up, navigate, and use. Lots of updates improving what they offer. Their live chat helpers are really helpful too and take the time to answer your questions thoroughly."
The support and dev staff are very helpful. We are happy about the current AMP pages and mobile user experience. Highly recommended!
This app is great at providing fast AMP web pages. The interface is very user friendly and the support team is helpful and very attentive to your needs. If you are looking to AMP you web pages to receive boots in mobile search rank then this the the perfect app and team to work with.
At first i was a bit overwhelmed with the Interface but once i understood the value of all the different options and got used to it. This App boosted our Customer service expirience from an 8/10 to an absolute 11/10! Thank you!
"Been using ReAmaze for like 3 months already. Awesome app. And definitely I can recommend for businesses with 3+ support teams! 1. Saves tons of time by keeping all tickets in one place: - Convenient filtering by STORES and ticket types - Single interface for tickets from various channels: email, Facebook direct and comments, etc. 2. Increases support quality by reducing the people factor 3. Eases the communication inside the team: allows convenient internal messages, etc. 4. Helps panning the support team load, providing easy-to-use, yet comprehensive reports 5. Saves time and helps managing the support team, by providing simple automation features 6. Finally, the support team DOES offer solutions. Not always the way I want or 100%-bullet-proof, but still those are solutions. Never was left alone with my issues"
"A SHOPIFY MUST HAVE. 
This app is extremely simple to use, only a few clicks and boom you now have an AMP shopify store. Page speed is huge when it comes to user experience and SEO, with AMP enabled pages you can enjoy 1-2 second load times!
This app also works very well and can integrate with many of the apps/services you likely already use. In my case I get to enjoy AMP page speeds and also showcase Viabill pricetags on my product pages. I have also had a noticeable increase in traffic since using AMP pages.
The few times I had questions, the customer service was extremely helpful and quick to respond. This app is most definitely worth a shot."
"We started using the free version of AMP by Shop Sheriff a few month ago and soon opted for the paid plan which allows to AMP all pages and we absolutely don't regret it. 
While it was doubling our app fees as it's priced the same as the basic plan of Shopify, it's money well spent. 
We were asked to leave a review from the beginning but decided to wait a couple months so we could give a review based on real experience. 
So here it is : 
We don't have any dev/coder in our team and had absolutely no problem setting up everything. Basically you just need to personalise your pages like you did with Shopify. The look and feel of the interface is quite similar, hence it's very easy and allow you to specifically adapt your pages content for mobile users.
Regarding performance, while we also did some SEO optimisation, our ranking in the search engines has improved a lot, so as our trafic and sales.
Conclusion : Really happy we took the move and we are considering getting the Shop app by Shop Sheriff"
We have been with Re:amaze for a while now and are really happy with the usability and the interface. Now just waiting for Instagram DM integration but we know that is in the hands of the IG gods. keep up the good work!
We tested Reamaze for a month before we launched our site. It's the best helpdesk software out there. Easy integration and FANTASTIC customer service. They've been available 24/7 to help me with any small (or big) changes. The Chatbot has decreased the time our Customer Service team has had to spend answering emails. The integrations are great. The interface is great. Can't say enough about the product and the team.
"I just made the switch from Zendesk to Re:Amaze. It's been about 2 weeks, and so far, so good! Their support is great (fast to respond) and the features this app/service provides are plenty for what I'm doing. The whole interface is pretty noob-proof too, so if you're not a very tech-savvy person, this app will be a great solution for you. Highly recommend!"
"Good app to use, the interface is fairly good and if I created another store I'd probably use it. We're currently using it on www.thepowerofme.co.uk to good effect."
"This is a great app for anyone trying to get the most out of their stores SEO optimization. It has a simple interface that show's you a preview of how your pages will appear on search engines and gives you a character count of exactly how much text will fit (both features shopify does not provide). If you need any help throughout the process, the customer support provided is great. Live chat! Great bonus. Thanks Amy!"
Amazing application with great user interface.  Does exactly what it is designed to do.  Can't believe it's free!
"I'm still in the free trial and I've already more than earned next month's subscription fee! Very responsive customer service, and very simple and user-friendly app interface too."
"This is far and away my favorite shopify app. The interface is intuitive, it's incredibly powerful, and the team keeps adding features. Using this app just makes me happy."
This app makes it so easy to standardise and update product meta data. The interface is very intuitive and easy to use.
"I previously used another Bulk Editor app for my shopify store, but I can say without hesitation that this app is superior. The interface is much more user friendly, it's just overall a great addition to any store with a large amount of products and variants."
A helpful and useful app saves lots of time. Great user experience and easy navigation. Perfect for product management.
"There are few return management apps available but only handful provide such an user friendly/simple interface and support cost effective European courier services. 
Staff is such a friendly and helpful that 2 people volunteered to help me at weekend to sort out a minor issue. In short, a free working app, better service than many paid apps, helpful staff; what more anyone can ask for?  Happy :)"
"I've been working with CJ for a couple of years now and I highly recommend this company. I used to work with a private agent but I found CJ to be more effective and very professional. They have a great interface that just makes it easier to manage my orders, sourcing requests, packaging. The custom packaging feature is great and allows you to choose among hundreds of different packaging. They are very fair and professional with disputes. Also great that they have warehouses in the U.S and Europe. My personal agent Diana does a great job and she's very friendly. Highly recommend!"
Been using this service since January and I have just upgraded to the Pro subscription with their 35% discount. I am very happy so far with the user experience and attention to details they have on the platform.
"Lots of recent 5 star reviews with only one sentence comments always makes me do that extra bit of due diligence and as part of that i check out the stores leaving these reviews. I recommend that you all check out the stores leaving these 5 star reviews too.
Anyway, I had high hopes as design interface was quite good and placing sample order was easy. Then it all went bad. There is simply no way I can confidently scale with this company based on the experience I am having with this sample order. Ordered a pair of sneakers on 20th January which gave ""3-5 days"" production time. 10 days later order still not shipped. After sending an email and waiting i was then told ""3-7 working days"" (which had also already passed). Anyway, i waited (not much choice). Finally I got a tracking number . I had paid for express shipping so thought I would get these fairly soon after production was complete. Nope. Still waiting and tracking still shows as ""Shipment information sent to FedEx"" . That's the last update from 21st July and here we are 10th August and no sample order has arrived and no updates. There is no way I would put volume through this group given the experience I have had so far. I am not angry, just genuinely disappointed and relieved. But better to find out now with one sample order than 500 legitimate customer orders. Feel like I dodged a bullet here."
Excellent user experience! I would definitely watch out for errors in the product description. Use Grammarly and make life easier.
"The interface is very comfortable, and I can see many kinds of package status, which is very convenient for me to track orders."
"In spite of Covid 19 Printy 6 have consistently produced my (high volume) of orders and been responsive and high quality overall. a
the interface is easy to use and the product range is good .
highly recommend"
Dallas from the support team was helpful and the whole user interface and simplicity of this platform is unmatched! thank you Jared and Connor
Easy to set up with a nice interface. Helpful and quick customer service. No complaints so far! Hoping this helps us with conversions.
"I like the easy customization and interface for customers to leave review.
Definitely help us solidify our social proof and instil confidence in our customers!"
"Amazing app, does what other apps do except it's free & probably better anyways. The user interface is great, easy to understand and easy to use"
Really easy to use.  Excellent Privacy Policy App with great features.  Clean and good flowing interface.  Great Job!!
"I am using this application for the first time. Very simple and intuitive interface, saves a lot of time and effort! In my case, it significantly improved the site and reduced its loading time."
Seamless way to add your products in Walmart inventory . The customer service is very competent and the interface is simple
It's really easy to install and use and I love how clean the whole interface is!
adds a awesome user experience to shop and easy to set up looking forward to seeing how our visitors interacts with it...great work guys
"This App is more than fantastic!
it is a really powerful tool to configure easily all your feed's channels with few clicks! The interface is great, fully customizable with rules and conditions, and lots of useful features ara available out of the box!
The customer care is really efficient, they will even assist you step by step and helping you out in configuring your feeds the best as possible!
5 starts for you guys, you deeply deserve it!"
Great app! I love the customizability it offers and ease of use. The user interface makes it very simple and it's a very powerful tool that nay website should offer!
"One click is indeed one click , very nice app backend interface with detail customer account lists. Awesome support , very much recommended for social media logins."
"Sky Pilot allows my shop to deliver large files to customers, with seamless Shopify integration. Customer service is fantastic, and they have always been able to keep up with demand when sales increase. The app is intuitive to use, and very professional in both the backend interface and the customer side of things. Sky Pilot offers features that no other digital delivery app on Shopify can do. Very happy all around!"
"This application is super easy to use and the user interface is extremely intuitive. The support team is also friendly, helpful, and very quick to reply. Thanks again Stu!"
Very bad app - you can't edit your badge shape and text. And the interface in the app is not user friendly at all.
"We couldn't be happier with Sky Pilot. This app has all the features you need to do digital delivery of files, and several thoughtful touches throughout the interface. It's very easy to work with, and has greatly simplified a workflow that would have been very complicated for us otherwise. And the support is phenomenal. I have only rarely contacted support, but when I have, responses have been practically immediate, and have solved the issue. We couldn't be happier!"
"Five stars, really nice app with a good interface and options. Really happy to choose GDPR to our website."
"Let me start by saying that I had not coded anything for over 15 years and back then we still only had HTML and Javascript to work with, so everything was knew all over again.
I found the Sky Pilot interface to be outstanding and easy to follow and even easier to customize!
I did have questions, which did not even have to do with Sky Pilot, but with Shopify and general web page coding.  Let me say that the support that Sky Pilot gave me went above and beyond what they not only had to do, but what any company would normally do for a client!
Also, I and my partner needed a custom plan to suite our company setup and they had one we could work with at a dang good price quick!
They simply are the best!
Darryl R."
A useful app with friendly and helpful support. Can position and resize your labels with a clear interface. Staff helped us make changes where necessary to suit our theme.
"Excellent ! Thanks guys for this work, well developped, works so great and many custom options for the best user experience, + it's free 5 stars well deserved :)"
"Have struggled with the Shopify/Xero interface over the last 6 months but things are definitely getting better now Bold has taken over eg  refund info is now appearing in the right place. I have had very good support with a recent problem.  I can't say that everything is perfect yet, but it is much more workable and heading in the right direction.

This app is easy to use and I create products as soon a new idea pops in my head. The interface is simple and understandable and the choice of products is amazing!!
"So far so good!  It's an easy interface, light code and clean look.  I had a slight issue on my install and support solved it in a few hours.  Very good customer service."
"Great app. We use it to build a new sales funnel via quizzes. Very user-friendly interface and flexible settings. Excellent level of customer service! Leonardo quickly responded and politely answered all questions, even recorded an explanatory video :)"
"Kanpai has helped me recover carts that would otherwise be lost. My store gets quite a bit of traffic but buyers often get distracted or bounce before they finalize a purchase. Previously I had to hope they would go through the buying process so I would have an email. Kanpai makes reconnecting with potential buyers much easier.
Support: I was in touch with their customer support, which was very approachable. I had a few specific questions which they answered promptly.
Usability: The interface is straightforward and took maybe 5 minutes to set up."
"In my opinion this is the best Push Notifications app on the market now. I am really glad that I decided to try this!
Three things that I really like so far: 
1) The app works really well on both mobile and desktop. The interface is really simple to understand and I had my campaigns setup in no time. Also you get to use your own custom branding and logo included in the free version. 
2) I like that they are transparent about what you get and have a very simple and fair pricing structure. I was able to setup my abandoned cart campaigns right from the beginning and also have unlimited subscribers on the smallest plan. 
3) The customer service! Till and Chris were super nice and helped me out with any questions I had. They even went above and beyond and gave me some general tips on how to improve our store - love good customer service!
In total this app is really amazing and I can fully recommend it to any store owner!"
"If I could give Kanpai 6 stars I would. I was really amazed by their customer service. Chris and Till were really working hard to help us with the setup and its a personal goal for them to see us succeed. I cant thank them enough for their help although it was really easy to setup!
Using Kanpai was really a game changer for my marketing strategy. The interface is beautiful, really well built and easy to use. I am super happy with the automated push notifications for cart recovery. Emails for abandoned cart is just not enough anymore! I really highly recommend you give this app a try!"
Support 1A. leichte Benützung sowie leichtes interface. würde ich jedem empfehlen. bei Problemen helfen die Damen gerne.
"Super cool app that was quick and easy to install, configure and have live on my site. Intuitive interface. Helpful customer support too."
Very intuitive interface and a lot of possibilities. Mark has been very helpful within minutes when I needed assistance!
great and easy to use. just works. Nice interface. good options. the click the link option is great. customization options are plenty and it's just a good tool
"Out of all the apps to connect to quickbooks, This was the best and easiest to use. Great interface and great support."
"Had one of the worst experiences with this app. Couldn't even begin to describe the months of back and forth while we helped them solved coding issue, fix crucial bugs and glitches. There is WAY too many codes that Growave implements on your site, 30+. This causes website to be slow and the user experience to be horrible. We upgraded our theme and deleted all the Growave codes because we were going to delete the App. Somehow we noticed that there was Growave code in the new theme! How it got there is highly suspicious. We deleted that App immediately after that. Over all this app is very novice in terms of functionality."
"Nice interface, very easy to use from day one. The email templates are a huge help. I'm looking forward to experimenting with the Collect & Convert sequence."
"Works okay I guess, but why does it take so long to 'prepare' the digital download when the users hit the checkout? This is a bit of a buzzkill when users have just purchased a product and they have to wait half a minute for a download to be 'prepared'. What needs to be prepared? It's just the same PDF file on a server isn't it? I don't get it. UPDATE: I emailed back and forth with the support team about this and it seems they aren't really interested in creating a better user experience. I've deleted this app now and upgraded to the free version of 'Easy Digital Products'. EDP is waaaaay better, cleaner and more reliable. I highly recommend skipping Shopify's app for digital downloads and instead using Easy Digital Products, it's a far nicer experience."
Great app! It has so many options and the interface is clear and easy to understand.
"Nice app with a number of different options to help increase your conversion rate. The user interface is very clean and simple to use.
Give it a go for 14 days. You've got nothing to loose."
This app was perfect for restricting orders based on vendor locations and the interface was easy to use as well. Their team was also very fast and professional at responding to one of our support inquiries. Would recommend!
"We're a long-time merchant online but new to shopify interface. Have tested several apps and we'd say Growave is the BEST app and company on shopify. The app itself and the superb customer service and the extra miles they are willing to modify their app to suit our unique needs on our trial! Alex and his colleage provided more than good customer support, they are the BEST. We're so happy and so satisfied with the app and looking forward to provide the service to our future customers! Thanks!"
This shopify app is simple to install and has a clean interface. Alex was quick to respond and a great help.
"Je laisse un avis mitigé sur Growave. C'est une application que j'avais installée et qui fonctionnait plutôt pas mal. J'avais activé la liste d'envies et la connexion sociale. Attention quand même car leur site démo est parfait mais les fonctionnalités ne s'afficheront pas forcément ainsi sur votre site, notamment le cœur de la wishlist qui n'apparaît pas sur l'interface de votre site sans un peu de développement.
Depuis leur dernière mise à jour ratée, l'application n'a eu de cesse de buguer et il était impossible d'accéder au compte client. Impossible donc pour le client de passer une commande. J'ai donc demander à Growave de supprimer le code car j'ai dû désinstaller l'application. Même si le service client est fort sympathique, mon compte client n'a plus la même apparence qu'à l'origine et cela n'a rien à voir avec thème initial. Je vous conseille de réfléchir à deux fois avant d'installer cette application car si vous avez un problème, il sera long et difficile de s'en débarrasser. De plus, Growave, qu'il faut contacter plusieurs fois, vous renverra vers le développeur de votre thème alors qu'il n'a rien à voir avec ce problème. Il s'agit bien de leur application qui n'est pas au point. J'ai réalisé mon site de A à Z et je sais très bien à quoi le compte client ressemblait avant. Attention !"
THE BEST APP we have even installed since we started using shopify. The support team is absolutely professional and the app is very thoughtful on every aspect on the interface and usage of the web page. 100% recommend.
"Update! We have had this App installed now for last 7/8 months - Highly Recommended App with great professional support, provided by great people. Customers experience a nicer, more secure checkout procedure with this App installed. Its So easy to install too and new features are always being added. Pricing is perfect. Cheers. europabay.com 

--------------------------
This review us long overdue! This App is a 5 Star, Must have App. The user interface in admin section is clean, crispy and very easy to navigate. In general this app adds another layer or level to security at checkout. Our customers love it and find the whole checkout experience more professional and secure. BIG Thanks to all the staff at Roboturk. Their customer service is also a 5 Star experience. Cheers. EuropaBay Limited"
"Selection of products are great, I haven't received a sale yet (just setting up my shop)  there's nothing better than having an interface to upload any image/file a person wants... that is exactly what it is like here, with the available details and decent shipping methods 
why didn't i find this company sooner......?
I'll submit some updates when some decent orders come in"
"I never imagined I would be able to design my own tartan watches! So far I'm impressed... can't wait to see my first sample watch... the design interface was really straightforward to use... After my order arrives I'll further review... The Tartan Artisan ®, Scotland. So far thumbs up! :)"
"Just getting started, but have to say so far their support people were super fast, informed and friendly answering all of our questions.  The user interface for uploading is pretty simple. They also sound like they have some beautiful new products in the works.  We'll update as we get going."
Such a great app! as cleaned up my product pages and made the user experience so much more enjoyable. Easy to install and hassle free integration.
"Super Application, les gens sont toujours très disponible et réactif concernant les problématiques de construction. Interface un peu complexe mais support vraiment au top ! Un merci particulier à Shermelia pour son soutient et sa patiente ;) Je recommande !"
"We love this app! its amazing when how do you order all the information.
this app is important to improve the user experience"
"UPDATE: 
The calendar is buggy and shows different availability depending on the user and device. Some of my customers report that they see different availabilities depending on if they're on their phone or PC. I am also able to see availabilities in my calendar from my end that are not supposed to be available. Some of my clients are getting very frustrated when I have to tell them that I have to reject their bookings because it overlaps with other bookings. 
I sent a report to Tipo 4 days and have not received a response. 
----
The  app supports multiple products, flexible time scheduling, and has a good customer interface. For a free app, it's already better than most paid calendar booking apps. Something I'd like to see improved in the future, however, are:
- Ability to include a text description on the booking page
- More ease of use for uploading your own images for the calendar background."
"This is a great app and the shopapps people were really friendly and teriffic during the very simple process to have wishlist installed at my store.  I was being a bit fussy and wanted the icon moved to a different place after installation and the support team was very efficient and helpful. The app is a great addition to the store as well. It is well integrated and the user experience is seamless. It also functions as expected.   As a relatively new shop owner, I am realizing that little touches like this,  that are electives -  really help a store come together into a functional unit- It's way more than just the design of your theme and what you are selling.  After struggling through all the nuts and bolts to figure out what i wanted and needed, installing wishlist was cake. A nice experience, a nice app and wonderful addition to the store.  It's also worth noting the that the helpfulness of the support team there was commendable and the app works great."
"An excellent onsite chat tool and the free plan is all we ever needed. The interface is a little messy, but there's lots of options. I wish you could better customize the onscreen icon, but that's minor. Likes: good mobile app, customized notifications, easy to see customer site journey during chat. We moved to Gorgias to bring all channels into a single view, but are considering going back to Tawk.to for chat only because it's much better."
"great superb while using loved its interface, hope its free afterwards.Thank you for supporting us ."
"A bit buggy. The menu interface is a bit clustered and the settings panel is not very user friendly. I say the entire menu interface should be updated into a more user friendly experience then this app would easily get 5 stars. Other than that and some minor bugs, the tawk.to app can be used while on desktop and also downloaded on your phone or tablet so you can chat with customers live...that functionality is great. Being able to customize the chat panel in many ways and automatically greet the visitor can be a very useful tool for your business. Gets the job done and I haven't found any other apps that compare in that regard."
"Not a fan of interface so I deleted it. Once deleted, the interface is still on the homepage. Have tried emailing support 3 times for a solution with no response..."
"This app has one of the nicest interfaces in the app store, it's easy to use and if there's any issues, they are reachable by email and help immediately. It's very easy to integrate and has lots of distinctive features that make it the best."
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. I love this interface! Please keep it free :)
"This app is out of this world amazing. There's no question about which messaging app to choose, go with this one! I would even go so far as to say this app is one of the best I have ever seen, peroid. The ease of use, slick user interface and countless features with amazing customizability makes me baffled that it's free. This is in it's truest form a free permium app, and the little ""powered by"" link isn't in your face at all, you can even remove it for $9 if you want to.
Stay awesome Tawk.to"
"This app offers a lot of customization. I like how it allows to add custom code, and code of the app. Also the user interface is quite neat"
"App load is fast, I like the user interface. It has some unique features which I like: lazy loading, image editor. The support team response very fast. Thanks for such a good app"
The app is very straight forward to use and Henry was great when we needed support help on setting up. The interface also looks the best in my opinion!
"The supports are really helpful, but if the chatting won't be disconnected by change a menu, will be really improve the user experience. Overall, the app is great!"
"Callum was a great support and app does exactly what is suppose to do, with amazing interface and slick features. Top and recommended"
"A good app that could be better. A little clunky in terms of user experience but does the job. Dan was very helpful in correcting our code to make sure customers can't order more than 1 free product from a goal. Would love to see a preview or test mode added to the app as the only way to see if it's working is to go live with it... not ideal. Also, would like the ability to have more than one free item for a customer to choose from."
"Thank you to Hextom for another amazing app...
This app helps us automate our store and can notify us and do actions on our behalf after we use the super easy interface to configure the automation. 
Thank you!"
"5 Stars goes to extraordinary Customer Support which helped me step by step to configure my customized fields, still I recommend developers to work more on enhancing user interface to enable more settings and possibility to define multiple customization for more than one type."
"We have several of Bold's apps on our new store.  So far, we have been very pleased with all the products.  The store locator is easy to use and find it useful for those who dont wish to purchase online.  The sales motivator is just that and the user interface (customer) is pleasant and easy to update/modify on the user interface (store side).  Customer service has been really responsive and helpful with our many concerns/questions.  To summarize, we would definitely suggest Bold apps to any other store that is setting up or needs a little boost in their product sales."
"Honestly, this app is great, first of all, it's very affordable comparing to other apps, it has no limits for translated characters The second thing, the user interface is pretty easy to use and you can set the automatic translation and go to sleep Lastly, the customer support is amazing"
"This Language App really helps us a lot with its dynamic and user-friendly interface. Very responsive, very helpful, and very knowledgeable customer service which is more than 5 stars. I can only say.. thanks, guys."
"Awesome with clean, easy to use interface"
"The best upsell app I found! Nice interface, easy to use and fast support."
"Really easy to use -- awesome interface, easy to use steps."
Absolutely amazing app for everyone who needs an instant checkout on any of the store pages! We had an issue with implementing the buttons on our home page but their development team went above and beyond to fix it and they did this customization free of charge. Absolute must-have for everyone who wants to have a better user experience in their store. Thanks One Click Checkout Team!
Really simple to use interface and amazing customer support who are friendly and go the extra mile to help!
"This app is essential for optimizing and improving the user experience. All the recording are fluid and informative, sometimes they take some seconds to load depending of your record length, but when you now this, it's just a minor detail. Congratulations to the team and quick support"
"Easy to install and collects great information that I can immediately use to sharpen my customers' user experience. Oh, and it's free!"
"We would consider using Print Melon more but they have the absolute worst design interface of any of the POD apps we use. In addition to the horrific interface, there is no way to filter by size, and even when a product description lists sizes, when you start the design process you discover the available sizes don't match the description. Given the POD competition surely they would redesign their Shopify website! After the response from the developer in May 2021, we decided to continue using Print Melon to see if they improved. Unfortunately, nearly a year later there are ongoing issues. For example, when you try and create a design for LAT 3821 their mockup generator produces four different mockups, including some with the print outside the design area. When I contact their support team I was told to make my own mockups! We are now actively looking to exit this service. The feedback here is to help them improve."
"Beautiful interface. Easy to use. Some elements were a bit glitchy (free gifts) so we weren't able to use it for our current sale, but the developer was helpful and we hope to be able to try it out again in the future."
"This is an excellent chat app, I love it.
The interface it's user-friendly, It's easy to use and configure"
L'interface est très intuitive et très facile à paramétrer. C'est le premier chat que j'installe et j'en suis pleinement satisfait.
"Beautiful app. The interface is wonderful....the customer service is great. However, there are some very important aspects of this chat program missing. For example, no app for the phone, the inability to apply store hours to the app, and the inability to allow different notifications for various different tasks (such as when a customer requests support). Keep up the good work. I am sure I will be back in the future."
I really like the user interface of the app. It makes it really easy to read the data and create custom reports.
"I was able to customize the solution to my liking. Final mile carrier shows up, easy user experience. Perfect if you are dropshipping. All Aliexpress carriers show up :)  The customer support team is there to help you make any changes.
For example, i provided a suggestion to add ""estimated delivery time"" and to fix some of the errors, it was fixed within 6-12 hours."
Really great app ! This app was very easy to install and I have a wide selection of currencies to choose from. Easy to use interface and customer friendly. I would highly recommend!
So far so good. This app was very easy to install and I have a wide selection of currencies to choose from. Easy to use interface and customer friendly. I would highly recommend!
This app does all that I need it do and has a very user-friendly interface. The support team has been very friendly and quick to fix any issues. Great work!
I used to use other app for shopify ebay integration and after a great experience with cedcommerce on etsy integration I've decided to do the same with cedcommerce ebay integration and I'm really glad I did. Simple interface and very user friendly and also a great support team. Congrats
"It's a nice support guy/team, but the app doesn't work. My intention was to use it for ""coming soon"" registration. I am specifically searching for a possibility that can send a now in-stock notification by email, not a ""pre-order/pay-now"" option. Though what I ran into with this app was unusable.

On the background it seeks contact with a .TK domain that is probably not reachable and that makes the app not do anything (even in production). 
Consulted with support and they asked me to reinstall it again, with the effect that my 3 dial trial was over right away. 
With support's help I got the ""coming soon"" email registration up and running, but then again, a few hours later, the app is not accessible again. Probably again due to loss of contact with the .TK domain. 
Furthermore, the user interface could use come tweaking. This app is just not ready for selling (or at least the functionality I wanted).
So I uninstalled the app. I now paid for something I don't use.
So my advise to these guys. Get another back-office domain and release something more stable. Don't work with new clients on features that aren't finished. I can see effort is done, but it just doesn't work for me now."
Great support team! The app itself is pretty simple to use and has friendly user interface. Would use it for more of my stores in the future.
Shopping Feeder's interface makes in easy to go in and update your feed. Henri makes himself available and is quick to respond to customer service requests over Skype.
"by far the most confusing and unfunctional google shoping data feeder. I tried installing this on a regular hp laptop and the website was not responsive to my laptop which is rediculous considering its not a mac or mobile, pretty sure all apps whether it be web or not is formatted to function and be user friendly. This is by far the worst app ive every used. Was on for not even a minute and got frustrated solely based on the interface layout."
"These guys are brilliant and super helpful with customer support. I found the interface slightly tricky and hence reached out to the support on their site chat at like 4 am and they had someone who was around and immediately entered screen share with me and got me all set up in a couple of hours even though I was still on free trial. The app in itself is pretty good. It's not baby proof and you might need some initial handholding but in a couple of hours, you get the hang of it. If you are lucky, you get a super helpful guy like Kurt who makes your life a lot simpler!"
The support team is extremely responsive and was able to help with all our needs. The interface has improved a lot and you can customize a lot of options to tailor to your shop. Totally recommend the app
This app is awesome. We were able to set it up in no time and it worked perfectly. Very intuitive interface and not at all glitchy or slow. The price is amazing for all the features offered and support responded immediately with a fix to a minor issue we were having.
Uninstalled the app and experienced user interface problems with my website. The bag icon still appears and flickers and my gallery is incredibly slow.
"Great idea, great interface but doesn't work at all. Made my shop crash with black squares everywhere !"
"Our onboarding experience with Intelligence Node was easy, we were up and running in a day. The software does exactly what we expect it to do and is highly accurate. The user interface is simple, intuitive, and professional looking. It is much better than other solutions we have used. In addition, their customer support team is fast and helpful."
Great customer service. Easy to make email pop ups. Easy to use interface and if you run into a problem they're there to help
This is the only app that would allow us to setup a free gift promotion and be able to enter a discount code too. The customer service was great when there was a small loading issue on our theme. The user experience is awesome too!
"Support is excellent. Fast answers and helpful information. The app itself is great and works well! I would like to see in the future possibly a more elegant user interface, but I can't complain too much about that because it functions as needed."
"I absolutely love Poptin. Super easy to use, all the features you need in a really easy to understand interface. Unbelievable support from Tomer who is lightning fast at responding and helping you out with any questions. It's great that he works on the front line and makes sure the team is developing things in line with customer's needs. 
I've used a few different pop up apps and find them bloated (eg Privy's free version calls several 3rd party scripts, slowing down the load time) and SO expensive for what they are. 
I was using the pop up built into my theme but couldn't see opt in rates so really wanted something to help measure and improve that, which Poptin does beautifully. 
If you're wondering which one to go with, THIS IS THE ONE. This is how all apps should be."
"Very helpful support team set up custom fields so that we can run reports directly from Shopify, easy to use interface with all of the fields that we needed. Thanks!"
AVADA SEO has a user friendly interface and their customer support team like Esther has a great reactivity .
"Apliiq is awesome! Customer service has been really great, especially Peter Lamb. Interface is super easy to use"
"Other apps on the Shopify app store should take notes from this one. Such a delightful experience from start to finish. The app is well made, both technically and functionality wise. Everything is easy to edit and fix yourself, you have access to do your own css and even edit the html in the emails. You also have a lot of control over how the app behaves in all contexts. I couldn't get the button below the add to cart button to function right away, and responded to the perfect welcome email I had received that I had some issues. A few hours later, I was followed up with visual suggestions as to how it can look, with the question if I wanted it like that. I approved it, and it was live when I woke up the next day. I can highly recommend both the app and the company, and I will take a closer look at other apps from this company too. We have just used the app for one day so far, and are already seeing nice results. You can't go wrong with this one. *The added benefit of being able to manually add emails for notifications when things are back in stock, is also something we have been missing for a long time, and is solved with this fantastic app. Some quick points:
*Full control over position, text, and design of buttons, floating buttons, emails, translations, css, html
*Built in tracking
*Manually add people to get notified saves time for customer service
*Integrates with Shopify, CM, Klavio and other email providers
*Can get checkbox to get added to newsletter too
*Export to csv
*Simple interface to get a quick overview
*Option to allow customers to manage email subscriptions in one place
*Notification reminders
*Can sync with some external warehouses too
*Webhooks for automations and other sync
*Same day support of high quality"
"I'm using this app for the first time, the interface is very intuitive and easy to use. First impressions are positive!"
"Rewind has been helpful to me in a couple of ways. I installed it originally for peace of mind before I updated my shop theme. Since then, I've used it to look back at the history of edits I've made to product pages. It helps me recall when I listed products originally. I like the interface, being able to swipe through the various versions. Similar in concept to looking at all the edits on a Google Drive doc."
"Perfect for backups, very easy to retrieve store data and store elements e.g. pages, themes, etc. The user interface is very friendly and easy to navigate."
"solid app i like the simple interface, thing i would improve is making things product specifc i think this is a huge issue and fixing this would make the app 9/10 thank you so much"
"Fantastic App in terms of User experience and personalization. Two elements that are so important when retaining customers, scaling up stores and boosting conversions. I highly recommend it!"
"I'm giving 5 stars because, from a professional artist's standpoint, the quality of art prints made by Fine Art America is unparalleled to ANY other printing app on shopify. Believe me, I tried them all. I ordered from each site, compared, and this is the only one that is ACTUALLY high quality. The other reviewers here want merchandise like pillows, t-shirts, etc... I can't vouch for their clothes or home deccor because I haven't ordered them. But I know for a FACT that their Fine Art prints are the absolute best. No other app on shopify can possibly beat their quality. If you compare their art print base prices to other reputable Fine Art printing companies like Society6 and RedBubble, their prices aren't bad. Best of all, they are RELIABLE. I can't tell you how frustrating it has been using other printing companies that have the frames arrive totally broken, bent, or lost in the mail. It takes up too much of my time combatting quality complaints from unhappy customers. The higher price is worth the quality on their Art Prints. They also ship world wide. & their interface for uploading artwork is EASY. CG Pro Prints (which people claim is the best for art prints... I didn't like their quality...) their interface is absolutely awful, incredibly confusing and time consuming. This PIxels app knocks it out of the park with ease & quality.
The only few complaints that I have is that the phone number listed on this app page here does not get you in contact with the technical developers of the app. That phone number just connects you with the printers at FineArtAmerica.com who don't know how to answer any questions about the app itself, only about their actual prints. 
It makes me sad that the other reviewers here are knocking down the rating so much of what is the BEST QUALITY art prints. Their art prints are TOP NOTCH, you will not find better quality on any other Shopify app, I GUARANTEE IT... and if you do, let me know, I'd like to see it in order to believe it. This company is unbeatable from what I've seen. Better than CG PRO prints, better than Printify or Printful or any of those other apps. This app needs a higher rating for the beauty and the quality Fine Art Prints, and their overall world wide reliability. I can trust them with my Art career.
I also reached out to them through the email they list here, and they responded within 24 hours. They also explained to me that recently they lowered the base prices of their apparel and lifestyle/ home decor type products. I also brought up the importance of including more frame options etc, and they took my suggestions to heart and added more of their beautiful frame options. It feels really great to be heard, and that they treat customers like their opinions/requests matter. The customer service is great -- They treat you like you are a valuable customer."
"Very intuitive interface. Easy to setup menu. Very happy with this app.
Customer service very good."
"So far, so good. Very clean user interface, nice and simple. Possibly better than some popular (& very expensive) alternative paid options (If you have enough google reviews for it)"
Great product. Easy to install with a clean interface. I would highly recommend this app to anyone looking to showcase their customer reviews.
I ran into some issues initially where I was not a happy camper.   However Brysen stepped in and saved the day.    This is a great app to run any type of sale.   The interface is very easy to use and I had my first sale up and running in just a couple of minutes.   Coupons are great to use however this is THE app to run the sales that your customers expect.   You should at least  use the trial period to check it out.   I am glad that I did.
"Overall, Smart Menu boasts the cleanest design, cleanest interface, and most technical flexibility of the mega menus I've tested. This menu's killer feature is ability to create text link lists using collection tags—This feature alone is worth the subscription.
There are a couple wish-list features I'd love to see added to improve this menu: 1) adding the ability to pull in recent blog articles and 2) adding the option to create lists from collections in order to make the process of creating and managing ""Best Sellers"" or ""Editor's Choice"" type link lists significantly more efficient. 
Nonetheless, highly recommended if you find Shopify's default navigation severely lacking and you are frustrated with the difficulty of competing mega menu apps."
"Great customer service! Very prompt and solved all my queries immediately. User-friendly interface, easy to use. Highly recommend!"
"amazing services!!!!! I wasn't expecting an app service's support team to respond to me in such a timely fashion. But they solved my problem in one day and did an amazing job beyond expectation. Without asking, they also update the add-on CSS to match my current theme. It saved a lot back and forth time.  
Another thing worth notice is that their support emails are also very professional. They highlighted area needs attention or action, from which I can feel how their team care about user experience:D 
Very happy about their product and services!"
"Great app, clean interface, and makes the process of accepting subscriptions very easy. Support is also top-notch. Had an issue regarding my shipping set up and I was promptly assisted by Erica. She was very attentive and followed up with me in order to help me get things sorted. Awesome support, I'm really impressed! Thanks and keep up the great work!"
"This app is great. Period. 1) It streamlines your workflow to include proof control on your order page, as well as alerts. Huge time/headache saver. 2) Provides a customizable template to match your branding, which obviously is indespensible. 3) Provides the seamless interface to your customer, making you look like the professional you are. 4) Pricing options are great... starts at free then ramps up as your store gets more customers (aka gets sales). Will be sticking with this app as it gives me exactly what I need, making it easier and look more professional. Thanks Proofer!"
"This app has made our whole design process much more streamlined! Instead of flipping back and forth between Email and Shopify, everything can be found in one place. The interface is very user-friendly and the messages that our customers receive look very polished and professional. As an added bonus, the app makes our order history much easier to understand and track-down for customer service inquiries. All around, a wonderful addition to our Shopify experience. 
On top of all that, their customer service has been really responsive and accommodating. Thanks, Nick!"
"Flits has an amazing customer service! I have been working with them for a week now to customize the app and Ankit always responds the very next day, communicates very clearly and his team makes all the requested changes carefully. And the app itself has a simple easy to understand interface. I highly, recommend this app! I am using this app on my website https://www.graamartisan.com/."
"Overall the app works, the updated interface is a lot more user friendly, but I wish some things were easier, especially from the customer pov."
"Im using this app, it helps me have higher conversions in my store, totally reccomend, nice interface easy to use"
Best app for recurring subscriptions. The user interface is great and the staff is always available to help
Gordon C was incredibly helpful in making sure we are set up for success. Our migration was implemented with ease thanks to Iopa and his team - very pleased with the interface and platform!
"Great experience so far since installation, the customisation is adequate and the end user experience is worlds apart from the stock experience from Shopify! Support has been efficient and my requests have been fulfilled normally within a couple of hours! Excellent! I'm using 3rd party apps for the wishlist and rewards scheme and they happily integrated them into my accounts section with no issues just the way I requested. Thank you everyone at Flits :)"
Great app thank you! Nice interface and support for our own customisations has been very friendly and helpful.
"Incredibly easy to use! Simple interface, straight forward directions.  Definitely a must add for your store!"
"I must say this app is flawless. 
There are so many things I would like to mention but I will mention only that are most important:- 
1. Interface from backend and for customer end, both are clean and very attractive. Easy to Use. 
2. Doesn't affect website page loading speed
3. Works exactly the same as it commits
4. Their customer support is very cooperative and responsive. We as a merchant can rely upon without putting any second thoughts. 
Must say go for it."
"Recharge has been great since we made the switch. The interface and customer support, specifically Gordon, have been incredible."
The interface seems great. I am not sure why the ads are not running and the impressions are 0 even after the campaigns are approved.
"Customer service has been fantastic! They helped us customize the app exactly how we wanted, all during our free trial. The interface is very user friendly but could use a few more options built in so as to avoid lots of custom coding. Overall the app has been very beneficial to our website and would recommend it."
"I use this app to help me quickly and easily keep in touch with customers. I'm time poor so this app's integration with Shopify helps me to quickly segment my database so I can customise emails to first time buyers, active, lapsing customers etc. It saves me a boatload of time and brings me a measurable and solid ROI. I'd like to see some improvements to the campaign reporting. For instance, being able to see sales revenue in the campaign list, beside each campaign, without having to click on the campaign itself. And the interface is a little dated I feel.
But for the money, it's well worth it."
Very useful app and prompt customer service! Easy GST calculating with a user-friendly interface. Thanks
"We used this App to generate GST invoices for our Shopify orders. The ease of using this product is amazing as the entire process took us 20 mins to setup, define GST slaps and generate invoices. The interface is very user friendly."
"Very happy. Simple to set-up. Needed a small tweak to the styling on our product page but the support was fast and very helpful. This has really helped cross-selling of our products, as the options are displayed right be the 'add to cart' button' without interfering pop-ups on the page, so has made a positive user experience. Thanks to the developers and support teams :)"
"Not knowing much about email marketing, we looked at the common players at the most basic way possible. It goes without saying that CM Commerce presents the easiest, most user friendly interface and provides services for companies of all complexities."
The customer service of this app is amazing. Love the interface & it is very easy to use. Would definitely recommend this for invoice generation.
"Fantastic app! I've been fussing around with Buddha Mega Menu for days, but the interface was so awkward I just couldn't get the hang of it. Decided to try another one, and boom!  Wow!  So easy, so many options!  Well worth the money, I think."
Great support team and it is easy to use! We've really been enjoying the Stamped.Io interface and their review system. Their customer service team is exceptional and make sure you are taken care of. Would definitely recommend.
"Other apps are much better. Stamped.io puts CSS customization behind a paywall, and their interface is ugly. It loads slow and is not nearly as user friendly and costs more. I'm not happy with it."
Good app for GST Invoicing. easy to use Interface. Its integration with Shopify is seamless and gives great results
"This app has been super helpful for us. We currently have two stores with the app. Although the free version has a lot of great features, our needs require us to use the premium version. We have been using the app for about 3 months now and it has improved the customer navigation experience on our website by a mile.
When we first started with the app, the developer team was super helpful and went above and beyond to help customize the app to our specific needs.
When you first start with the app, it might take a while to get used to how to adjust the menu. Once you get the hang of it, the interface feels very smooth and fast! 
Unless you have the resources or expertise to code an easily customizable, professional-looking menu to your store, this app is the way to go. After trying a few menu applications, the smart menu app is a no brainer.
If you want to check out our version of the menu, head to our site at classymencollection.com"
Really Impressive App. Online Service is too good and quick service. Recommend this app. Interface is very friendly and easy to integrate
Awesome app really changed the user experience for theend users.
"I'm using this app on my store, the quantity breaks and discount work fine but what doesn't work is when you manually edit say for example the ""title"" & ""description"" of the discount group. The app simply doesn't update this on your website thus making the edit meaningless which forces you to contact customer support. 
Another problem is when uninstalling the app within the app settings. It says to wait up to 10 minutes until you can delete the app from your apps. I did that and actually waited over night to give it some more time. I then deleted the app and the quantity breaks were still on my website. 
Keep in mind, this is a great app. The quantity breaks and discount work. The interface is easy to use. I definitely prefer this app because it's the first one of this type that I use and i'm already used to it. I recommend it but when tiny bugs like this occur it makes me want to seek another option."
"The app makes writing new Shopify templates and pages a breeze. It's SUUUUUPER powerful and it's user interface is next-to-none in simplifying more advanced template development tasks. I'll be personally using custom controls with embedded JQuery to redirect form box control fields to a custom Node.js app that will capture the values and integrate with 3rd party platforms like ClickFunnels, SendGrid, MailChimp and Amazon AWS S2. Also their support is ABSOLUTELY THE BEST HANDS DOWN!!!"
"If you're looking for a Mega Menu, this is the menu for you! It's easy to install, setup and customize. With some of the newest updates the team has made the interface is even easier to use. It's easy enough to work with that even our clients can rearrange their own collections.
Support was helpful and quick to respond. Thanks guys!"
"It has very clean and easy to use interface, I will recommend this to any start that aims to reach a wider audiance"
"Awesome little widget with a super user-friendly interface, exactly the functionality you need, and the greatest customer support. Thanks, guys!"
"This is a fantastic bulk product editing solution for Shopify. Clean intuitive interface with all the functionality you will ever need to bulk edit all aspects of your products. The spreadsheet upload is the best methodology for this - and is unique to this app. You can also easily perform all the edits from within the app; but the spreadsheet function is the true gold here. 
Clean, fast, & top notch support from the developer. Super reasonably priced as well. Thanks for saving me hours and hours of time with all my edits :)"
"I wanted to use Chaty to have more interface with my customers.  After trying to install it (unable to due to my computer settings), I contacted Chaty directly.  Gal quickly contacted me back and set it up for me momentarily.  That’s some amazing service!  I am using Instagram, Facebook messenger, SMS, and email as my channels.  Chaty installed these with ease, it’s up and running like dream, I’m a happy customer!!!"
"Without a doubt, Simple Inventory app is the inventory updating app to beat. Easy to use, Easy to read interface.  I am completely blown away with the level of quality and polish that comes from an app that charges so little each month.
You need this app, no others."
"We're using this app to auto tag orders from different sales channels (i.e. Amazon). One channel we needed was missing from the workflow, but the developer responded and added it right away. The app's interface is clean and easy to use. Definitely recommend!"
"I'm using the app since 5 months and honestly it works perfectly. The user experience is great. But what I prefer in the app is the aftersales service, the chat is great, and people working there are always happy, fast to solve your issues and professional. Special thanks to ""TRIX"" on the team :)"
"I use this app to provide social proof to potential customers who are browsing my store looking for original video games and anime products - which is especially useful in Japan. I like the simple backend user interface. This app is quick to install and set up, so it only takes a few minutes to have it up and running on the site. I wish there were a few more font and color customization options for the popup text, but otherwise, I`ve never had any issues with it and it definitely does its job quite well!"
"We've been searching for a Quantity Discount app for our Shopify website for some time now. The worst ones made us duplicate our inventory which left a messy looking back-end product list along with foreseeable issues with other apps that need access to the product database. Other options we tried looked good but did *not* offer whole-cart-quantity discount which we really needed (we are not concernt of how many Widget A's a person buys, but rather how many total items across all product types). Discounted Pricing did this for us. One thing we really enjoyed was just how CLEAN is in terms of integration with our theme. This app utilizes dynamic on-the-fly creation of discount codes to achieve the end goal. Pretty clever actually! The ability to customize the display snippets was very good and the admin interface is top notch. Although I didn't mind the out-of-the-box CSS/HTML, I did go ahead and modify by hand to make for the best looking integration possible (this is always the case for a perfect looking website). I'm very pleased and would gladly recommend this app even if it is a little pricier that others and customer service isn't always the quick. Thanks Booster Apps!"
In redoing our website we were looking for a bundle app that fit what we were trying to offer - some preset items and then allow the customer to select x amount of other items. I tried about 10 other bundle apps which only allowed an already assembled bundle - not what we wanted. I did find one other that did what we needed but it was more to pay per month and the interface presented to the customer was not as nice. I was absolutely in love with the graphic that is displayed while “building your box” was the icing on the cake for deciding to go with this app. Looking forward to hopefully future improvements where we can choose multiple variants of the same item using the single display option.
the only app of its kind that does the box bundle well. good interface. good customer service. I would recommend for sure
"I am so impressed with this app! This is the only app I found that: 1) has a seamless, easy to use interface, 2) looks professional and pulls theme formatting automatically, 3) allows customers to view detailed product pages and multiple photos from within the app, 4) Makes the step selection super clear, 5) Offers outstanding customer support. I reached out to have a font and a word changed in my pop and Jalal sorted it for me the same day! Thank you so much for making this process so easy for people like me who are new to ecommerce!"
"Outstanding app and Outstanding Service
It took some time to interface with a ""complicated"" Client but they have worked on it every day following the ever changing requirements of my Client. 
Thanks for your help.

"Great app! I was looking for something to automate and create an xml feed that I can upload to Google Merchant Center and run Shopping Ads, and this app solved it for me. It provides access to all the data fields, user-friendly interface, and robust function capability.
More importantly they have great customer support from Henri. He handled all my questions professionally and patiently. Even called via Viber then Skype to make sure everything was operating smoothly and offered guidance. Highly recommended if you're looking for a Feed app!"
"Great app with great support. I was looking for something to automate reporting. This app provides access to all the data fields, very simple interface, and very robust function capability. The staff support is excellent"
Offers a sleek user experience allowing your customers to build custom gift sets. Had some additional tech requirements and the response was fast and helpful.
"Love the Box Builder interface on our website - very clean and a great user experience. Plus, Customer Support is fantastic! The team is incredibly responsive, making set-up and troubleshooting a breeze!"
This app has helped to streamline my onsite user experience! It was straight forward to set-up and support are quick to respond and very helpful!
The app is working well and the customer service is pretty fast. Pretty reliable feed. Good and very polite services from Henri when we had to select a plan. These guys really take care of their customers. The user interface could be improved to make things just perfect but overall it is fine. Installation is a snap as we are guided all along in a few simple steps to connect with Google shopping. They have nice daily/weekly or monthly reporting and you get motivating email confirmation when their feeds generate orders!
"Finally found an inventory app that can keep up with our business that uses three different platforms combining retail and wholesale prices. The interface is simple and to the point, all the action happens behind the scenes, no need to hire someone to learn how to manage this app as well. Trunk is made for business owners!"
"I used this app to transfer all my products from shopify to ebay to get a wider range of traffic. The chat support was helpful but a bit slow to respond and very persistent about me leaving a review which was uncomfortable. The interface is a bit wonky, doesn't translate 100% with shopify attributes but sure saved me a lot of time in the grand scheme of things. Transfered all my photos and descriptions perfectly.  
*update, the developer of this app is continuing to harass me to now change my review, has found me on all my personal IG account and whatsapp, officially creeped out."
"I have a children's clothing business where I sell on Etsy and Shopify. It was such a headache to keep the two systems in sync and an even bigger headache when I started posting multiple listings containing the same products on Etsy. Not only was I wasting time doing inventory counts and making sure things were in sync, but I often would sell out of something that I no longer had in stock and would have to work with the buyer on an alternative (often offering a discount). I did a ton of research and Trunk Inventory came out as the best system to use. It's super simple for non-technical folks such as myself and the interface is crisp and clear. Oh, and it works like a charm too! I did my last inventory sync a few months ago and haven't had to do one since! The platform is amazing and saves me countless hours. It may seem pricey, but when you break down the time you will spend keeping your inventory in sync, $1-$2 a day is totally worth it!!! Get Trunk NOW. Seriously, you'll wonder why you didn't do it sooner!!"
"I always test an app for 5-6 months before writing a review and in this case I'm delighted to post one. We have used a number of stock sync apps but none which has worked so well. It's highly accurate, the interface is simple and it has the right amount of diagnostic information. Hats off for a job well done."
"Loving the platform so far, and the support is incredible!  Thanks so much for the help with everything, really excited to improve our user experience."
Very helpful and easy to use. Love the interface and the videos provided to start with. Were very help and made my job faster.
Instant Search + works very well for us. Setup is easy and the user experience is great. Results pop in without any delay.
"The app integrates smoothly, has a clear interface, is not too expensive and the live chat support is immediate and helpful."
I love the clean and easy-to-use interface of Print Melon app.  The prices of the garments are fair (the adult tees are less pricey than Printful!) and I like how many different styles are available.  I ordered some sample products and I really appreciate the good print quality.  I also emailed a question and their team got back to me within reason.  Really excited to use this interface for my orders this busy season.
Amazing app. I use it to collect emails with MailChimp and offers coupons. Very professional user interface with a nice drag and drop builder. Every Shopify user should have this!
"So far so good! Great interface, easy to use and setup. Cost is well worth it. Bold Apps make some of the best we've seen after searching and trying out various trials."
"The email templates are good and the interface is easy to use, but unfortunately it's very slow and crashes often."
"We really wanted to use this app for managing Amazon, Walmart etc, however unfortunately, despite our best efforts to configure this app properly and to reach out to Support a few times by chat, email etc, there has been no response and this app did not work for us. We wanted this to work and got commitments for a zoom walkthrough etc, however, no one ever returned our messages or emails and the interface and functionality really aren't where it needs to be."
"We are just starting to use Seal Subscriptions and have been dealing with Henry for configuration questions we had along the way. Henry and the team have been excellent to deal with, and the App so far is working great. We also like the user experience and the configuration options this App has to offer. Highly recommend this App."
"The customer support is really horrible, you better live midnight to receive their email back. No instant feedback, anything wrong happened you just wait. And email explaining is horrible, not helpful at all. By the way, the UI Design of your interface is horrible. I am switching and your competitor has WhatsApp and skype live chatting support, your competitor is way better doing than yours. Cheers and please improve in the future, make money and hire someone to re-design your interface. Please!"
"Excellent customer service; when I had a problem they responded right away and fixed the issue immediately. The interface looks great and free feature seems plenty. I just started using this app, but it seems like it will be great!!"
"We have been using this app for probably a year or so now and its proven worth while. At first its daunting with all of its options, details, information, and features. It has a user friendly and good looking interface. It takes some time to learn as you go, but this is backed up by an amazing support team who are always on top of your issues. Responses are prompt and follow ups are never missed! This has sped up our listing time dramatically. It has its own personality as you learn little tricks along the way to clear certain errors. This is probably the best of its kind out there. They keep up with the ever changing marketplaces. As complicated as it is already, now being comfortable with the software i do wish they added a few features to make this a near perfect solution to listing. I would like to be able to view all products in one large global viewing pane so that you can isolate a single listing that is split between market places, without having to keep switching between marketplace tabs and searching for the listing each time. I think this will help users clear any errors quicker than the current method. It also allows users to further ensure the products are listed in all locations, making it quicker and giving the user more peace of mind. Thanks Codisto and your support team, a truly amazing app!"
"Codisto integrates seamlessly with Amazon, eBay, and Google linking all or part of your products. The customer chat support is outstanding. The interface is easy to understand and comprehensive."
Easy + intuitive app interface and excellent and quick customer service. Works perfectly fine! Thanks.
"Excellent, very well-designed app! Our client showcases many interior design projects, and this app allows them to easily create an image presentation in an interesting and compelling way. Many useful features, including the built-in lightbox, and the ability to link images to other content. The interface is easy to use and understand, and Widgetic customer support is outstanding."
Great app and amazing support! The interface is user friendly and when we needed any customization they did it for us very quickly!
"Easy to use interface, including bulk importing. Great customer service. They were very kind and helped me customize the theme to fit my needs."
Great new user interface and features in version 2. Works like a charm. Wonderful and friendly support. Recommended.
"Wonderfully powerful app! Most orders from our store ship in multiple boxes totaling over 150 pounds. Me and my team must have talked with Shopify a dozen times (maybe more) about this problem and if there was a workaround. Finally, on the last phone call we placed, they revealed this gem of an app. It handles multi-box shipments of any weight and uses real-time carrier-calculated rates. There are so many customizations. It even plays nice with other apps. Burt was extremely helpful in getting me setup and acquainted to the user interface, which is extremely intuitive and simple-to-use. I was relieved when I learned you could do .csv uploads. It's amazing how many apps lack this feature. This is really a must-have app.
This app only has one review of less than two stars (at the time I'm writing this, although I don't see it ever getting a bad review) and I don't know why it was negative. The interface isn't on Shopify's website, but working with the Advanced Shipping Manager app is like working on any app in the backend. I realize this started as a Yahoo Merchant Stores program, but it works amazingly in Shopify. I could really care less what other platforms it is built for; we use Shopify and it works great for us."
"app muy intuitiva y con mucho valor. Te permite cambiar botones de las RRSS entre otras cosas, editas cualquier aspecto de la interface de tu web. Muy recomendada"
"This app does exactly what I want it to do with a userfriendly interface.
Very helpfull designers who really took the time and effort to solve the initial issues I had with a specific feature.
Great work!!"
ultra nice and easy to imlement. Makes the user experience 200 times better. And free what's not to like.
VIP has an easy drag and drop interface for easy setup and works exactly how it's described (just follow the directions y'all). We recently upgraded to a premium theme and the Eshop Guide support team went above and beyond to help us get the app setup. Overall great app with a support team that will stand behind it!
"We must agree with all previous positive reviews of this app and David. When we tried to install this, we had problems because the theme our website is based on (Yourstore) is not from the Shopify theme store. We also heavily customized it with custom code and other Shopify apps. We contacted the Variant Image Penguin folks, and within I think a day, the app was installed and working. As we continuously improve our graphical user interface, not having a dozen images on our product page is making our design job easier.
Thanks Dave."
"The app works just fine. The interface is beautiful and easy to use. Amazing customer service, very helpful."
"This app is awesome. The interface is super simple, and the customer service is outstanding. Had an issue with my theme, and the guys took the extra time to fix it. Really can't say enough about this. Thank you for a great app!"
"Once you get the app working, it performs beautifully 98% of the time. But when it fails 1/100 times, it only takes a couple hundred wholesale orders before errors with the discount make you wonder if it's something you did or something wrong with the app. The support staff is kind and helpful, for the most part, but we've had tickets dead-end because nobody seems to know why the app didn't perform correctly. The setup is also not super straightforward, but that's something that the support staff was quick to fix with us. Overall, it's a great app, but the semi-convoluted interface and the mystery failures are what's keeping us from giving it five stars."
"Super easy to set up. Tree pricing is surprisingly low. I'd love to see a bit more integration into my shop interface, to help draw attention to the trees being funded with each purchase so I could use this positive action also to better leverage this awesomeness for my own branding, but for now I can add a bunch of this stuff myself manually, and am just happy at how easy it was to get started."
"I like the idea, but the app interface on Shopify is pretty limited. Select the number of maximum trees and how many per order. What about:
Showing it to your customers on your product page?
Which code should be added?
Sending customers an email about the trees they planted (pictures)?"
"Its a little more expensive than the other Product Options Apps, but its the only one that allowed me to do all the things I wanted.  It works really well and smooth and provides a great seamless user experience for the end user."
"Best personalised recommendations app. Intuitive interface, easy to use and whenever there's something that I cannot personally solve, the customer support is amazing!"
"Like it! Beautiful interface, good support, fair pricing. I do think that there's room for some more flexibility and some functions seem missing, but work-arounds are mostly available."
"Absolutely fantastic app, amazing support and a brilliant interface. If you haven't installed it yet - get on it."
I just downloaded the app and I have to say I love it so far! The interface is easy to use and there are several options to choose from. Would definitely recommend it to everyone.
"This was very easy to set up and start using, very easy interface to use and easy to understand.  I would like it if it could generate its own discount codes and if it had a pop-up to give a discount if the customer gave a like on Facebook.
Otherwise, a very easy app to use and useful in helping with sales"
"So far, my experience on printful has been very convenient. great layout and interface, and the best part is my product looks very good in person ! Good customer service, and easy to use"
"A truly fantastic platform. Prices are a bit high, but the value, quality and user experience are well worth it. The system pushes low-res mockups to your store, but you can manually download high-res mockups from product templates. The lifestyle mockups are a real game changer for startup stores and a feature I greatly appreciate. Would really love some more model options."
This is a great tool for easy badge/labels on your products. I've only used the free version but it has a a lot of different options and I only need it for a few products at a time. Simple interface as well and easy to use.
"We at THEPONCER use it to create our banners for newsletters, sale announcements, offers etc. Very easy to manage and has a simple interface with a lot of flexibility provided. We like that it that the banners are not too intrusive from a space standpoint (esp on mobile screens) and help get the message across. Worth exploring."
"Works great. I would highly recommend to others. Good selection of products, easy to use interface, and great addons to further enhance your brand."
"I swear its a new problem every single day with these idiots. I unsynced one of my product variants from the printful interface because it was out of stock (no surprise there, these people cant keep anything in stock) and now there is no way to resync it. They only have a choose product button which forces you to completely recreate the product. I am getting so sick of this incompetent company screwing over my business."
"I tested this app out and found it extremely easy to navigate and the interface was very fresh. I had some quick questions and the customer service replied to me in minutes, very friendly and helpful. I'll absolutely continue using this app."
"Great customer service, easy to use interface! Lots of ready-to-use badges! But you can even create your own badge!"
"Max from support was extremely fast, I tested several wishlist apps but all were loaded after the rest of the page, which gives a bad user experience and ruins the overall looks of the website. Wishlist King loads instantly with the website, is integrated perfectly and follows the theme design. The app is integrated manually by Max and done so excellent, three emails and the app was customized, set and ready to run."
"So far, no recovered sales, so hope I can extend my trial. The interface is easy and intuitive to use so I have high hopes for this product :)"
Simple interface and works as advertised. Support response was quick and efficient too. Would not hesitate to recommend it!
Very Clean interface. VERY easy to use. I've been using it for over a year and have recovered a good number of sales using this app. I just had an issue with some billing and JENNY helped me out very quickly with full resolution. Absolutely fantastic customer service. Please give this app a go!
"Simple and user-friendly interface, just install and works everything for me
express technical support, highly recommends."
"I've been using Shopify for a lot of my eCommerce clients and Consistent Cart continuously impresses my over the years. They have improved so much in terms of User Experience. Very easy to set workflows on email, push notifs and SMS. It will be 5start if they have kept the Messenger promotions like before. but all in all I'm happy with current workflows!"
Love how easy it is to set up and how clean the interface is. It took 5 minutes to complete the whole process in sending out my first recovery emails. I recommend this app.
"Adroll has been the most consistently excellent user experience of any marketing strategy we use. We have an assigned account manager (Tracie) who actively wants to see us succeed. She checks in with me more than I contact her and we meet at minimum, once per quarter, to make sure our marketing strategies are working and we keep our content fresh. We see some excellent ROI and I would recommend adroll to anyone in any industry."
Great customer service and a user-friendly interface. Gets me a lot of traffic every day and has some smart AI campaigns to offer as well.
"We use this app for digital display ads on third party websites, and it has really help supplement our paid strategy in addition to ads on social media. The interface is really easy to use and once you set it up, they just run automatically and it's an easy way to generate revenue without thinking about it constantly. We see at least a 3.5 ROAS every month and are very pleased with these results! It has also been very easy to get help from AdRoll, and Tracie especially has been super helpful with growing our strategy and encouraging us to try new kind of ads. I highly recommend AdRoll to anyone looking to grow their marketing strategy!"
"This app has been fantastic for setting up flash sales and scheduling discounts in advance. Simple, straightforward interface and powerful tools even in the free version. Looking forward to automating our store's BFCM sales this year instead of manually setting discounts on the day they need to go live."
"This app work PERFECTLY WELL! Easy to use even for a novice.
Of course you cannot beat the price, but having tried another very similar (about the same) I can certainly say that this is much easier to use with a better anc clean interface.
Job well done!"
"I've only used the app for a few days but so far the interface is really nice and simple to use. I like the addition of the sale badges which I am yet to use though. I had an issue the first time I tried the app but I reached out to support and they were prompt, helpful and super great."
"Uptrack really exceeds my expectations, the interface is really clean. I never had any PayPal disputes (for missing tracking) after is installed this app"
"This has been such an easy win - a really useful addition to our website! Super quick to set up (aka about 1 minute max), and looks great on our website. It's been incredibly easy to use so far (it's been live for about 24 hours). The design is really good. You can either use AI to build the also bought, or create your own - so this has been really useful for an 'add-on' service on our website. The interface works really well."
Great app that has reduced the manual interface with the customer as well as providing a small saving on returns.  Look forward to it continuing to develop to offer EU returns and interact more comprehensively with Shopify.
"ShipStation has given me 40+ hours a week back! My only regret was not finding them sooner. LOVE, LOVE Ship Station. EZ interface, ez to setup and seamless to use. If in doubt, give them a try! I've used them for quite a few years and always been thrilled."
"Great app for personalisation with good quick technical support help.
Could be improved with a more mobile-friendly interface (or it may just be how it runs on my site)"
"As is SO OFTEN the case with Shopify apps, this has the potential to be a great app but our user experience has been weakened by what seems like a bug. 
Any changes/edits we make in the template loses the custom font size on the integrated customer labelling we require in our delivery order template and we have to return to the template html code to manually reset it each time.  
Had to do it again this week after flagging this and getting support in May 2020."
"Been using this program for years.  Amazing.  Great interface, easy integration, very very user friendly."
"ShipStation makes our fulfilment a breeze! The interface is clear and simple, yet powerful. The automation features have really come in handy. It helps automatically enter shipping parameters like automatically bypassing local pickup orders, automatically configuring shipment signatures based on order value, or automatically loading settings based on order item presets. It has been super reliable, definitely would recommend."
"I never got a chance to fully use Shipstation because the interface was not user friendly and it didn't immediately connect to my store. By the time support called me to help me out, I'd already moved on to a different app and had shipped many packages.  It's unfortunate because I'd already loaded all my shipping accounts."
"I've had less than satisfactory results with Shipstation. It takes a long time for the program to enter and have high-speed Internet. The user interface is less than intuitive. Overall I think there has to be a better way, I just haven't found it yet."
"Updating our review-unfortunately Route has had major bugs and customer service issues of late, and we are de-activating. The slow response times, denials for arbitrary reasons, and billing issues (double billing us multiple times) is worsening our customer service experience, not enhancing it. (ORIGINAL REVIEW: We had some initial bugs implementing Route, but customer support and partnerships teams have been very amenable to my suggestions for improvement, and finding creative solutions that fit our brand ethos and website user experience. We pay for full coverage so it's a little pricey. I will say that the customer paying for Route at checkout was problematic from the start, which is why we went with full service. )"
"Out of all the apps I've used and paid for on Shopify, this one officially takes the cake as being the most awesome. We spent an entire day going through each of the different instagram apps in the shopify app store; so just trust us this is the one you want!  We struggled to get others customized exactly the way we wanted.  This one has so much flexibility and the user interface is so intuitive and easy to navigate, it makes mapping your instagram product a breeze.  So happy to have found this app when we did.  At the pricepoint they have it listed, it's an absolute must for anyone that does social marketing.  Thank you Like2Have.it, we look forward to a long and successful membership with you as our website grows!
6 MONTH UPDATE:
As expected, the app continues to amaze us.  They've continued to develop new features and they truly listen to the customers. No idea is too big or too small. If they see the value to the customers, they're going to try and make it happen.  I expect we will continue with Like2Have.it for a very long time.  Still going strong! Thanks Marissa!"
Migrated a store off a home-grown cart.  This app has proved very valuable in not only migrating from our previous url structure but also in helping surface and install redirects for requests from a structure we used several years ago.   Interface well thought out and makes dealing with 404s very quick and simple.   Definite recommend.
"Does as advertised, gives daily reports to let you know if there should be any areas to look at, and easy to use interface. Tried a few redirect apps and this is the best so far."
I have been using the app for about 4 months now. The interface is responsive and easy to use. The free version is enough if you're starting out with your store.
"If I could give these guys 10 stars I would.....we are custom clothing manufacturers and needed pricing variants for tailoring, custom sizes etc and this App delivered! I had 3-4 conflicting theme issues and emailed them to help me urgently.....as we have our BFCM sale on and time was imperative....they responded within 5 minutes....and kept tweaking things until the App worked perfectly. 5 minutes.....on a SUNDAY!!!! I've never experienced service like this from any other developers.....do yourself a favour and install this App if you are looking for a beautiful interface, simple drag and drop functionality, and world class support."
"Wonderful form builder app!!! Intuitive interface, customizable options, and their Customer Support is very responsive! Would highly recommend!"
Love the user interface. It's simple to build a contact form and it looks great on the front end. Support was awesome to work with and helped me get it on the page I needed. Highly recommended.
"Great app! Works perfectly. Great support, intuitive interface. Highly recommend using it!Easy to use！"
Amazing app! I was able to set options for my variants in no time. The user experience of our website became so much better now. I really recommend this app to anyone who has complex products that require several variants.
"Won’t allow you to post form on a shopify page, documentation is wrong. Other than that, easy to use and good user interface"
"I think it is a great app. Simple, well designed, user interface and accomplishes what it claims. App has improved the customer ordering experiences for our custom products. During install received support to get app working with the store theme, making it easy."
"I looked at several zip code validator apps, and this one had the best user interface and features for our needs. I had a few questions during setup and customer support was OUTSTANDING - quick replies and very easy to work with. I had a couple of challenging issues in my config and he helped me work through them easily. I wish every Shopify app was this well supported - I highly recommend it!"
"Great app, really enjoys using it. Very friendly interface and have great tools that will help my business to boost SEO. Thank You"
"Great app, really enjoys using it. Very friendly interface and have great tools that will help my business to boost SEO. Thank You"
"helped me with seo, especially on page optimizations. put everything in one interface and walks you through step by step. good if your not an seo expert"
"The support staff is really helpful, friendly and fast response too. Things can be improve is the design interface of the app. Please make it more pleasant and make the design layout more interesting and easy to navigate/understand."
Used this for an anouncement about my X-Mas delivery-times. Very easy to use and for me an extra pro: A german user interface.
The pages created looked great and the interface was easy to use.  I recommend using this app especially for beginners
This app was very easy and straightforward to use. The user interface easily walked me through the setup process and gave me valuable options.
like the interface has a clean display and appears to be faster hope it improves customer shopping experience
Fantastic support by Mark - great app and great interface. Highly recommend this app for fantastic AMP pages.
"very easy to manage, fully customisable also with te free plan. Lovely interface, very good feature"
Affiliatery by Staqlab is the best way to manage Affiliate Program in Shopify Store... Easy to config and very easy user interface as well... It has all the feature you need to create a perfect affiliate program. Above all Online Chat Support Rocks! Thank you!
I think it's great! The interface was very easy to use. It had all the relevant options. And the result looks great!
"I use this app to make a countdown flash sales and the result is amazing , the interface is easy to use , i recommend."
"Over all not a good user experience and HIDDEN COSTS - I do not recommend this app.
App description sounded good so I tried it out. For the beginning I tried out the free plan just to further inspect the timers. I created one and was really happy because it was easy to do so. After saving the timer it congratulated me for choosing the unlimited plan which costs a monthly fee, which I definitely didn´t signed up for. The customer support wasn`t any helpful either. Really slow replies and not any helpful ones either.
Over all not a good user experience and HIDDEN COSTS - I do not recommend this app."
"Support was good and attentive until they made changes that caused everything to push the content of my website down, hiding 50% of my content. I allowed them time to resolve this based on their email, simple CSS tweak, and it's been several days now and no response. They billed me after the trial period. Unacceptable shopify.
The product pages do not appear the way they say. I asked them to make it ""Look"" and ""Function"" the way their screenshot examples show. They were unable to after making a CSS tweak. It just got worst.
Mobile view is terrible. It hides nearly all your pages content which they should understand is poor UI/UX (User Interface / User Experience) and will cause your user bounce rate to increase dramatically... Unsatisfied. 
They do not have the ability to edit the CSS directly through the app. 
Looked cool on the examples but what I received from support only made my website worst."
Good App... The interface is good and easy to operate with. Looking forward to have it as my primary app.
"I tried this service just now. Have tried some more Apps but this seems very convenient and serve the purpose.
Interface is simple and good. Templates option also great.
Good Job. 
Also i would recommend you to work on order notification too. Like Once customer placed order, cancelled.. Keep doing great works"
"I am using this app for the last 2 weeks and the result is very good. Support is also very good. I found it better than some other apps. The interface is also very easy to understand, the template option. Realy love this app..."
"The very nice and useful app for my store thank you so much, guys
very nice interface and easy to install"
"We absolutely love Junip! The interface design and features match the modern aesthetics we aim to provide, and the support team is AMAZING! We ran into a coding issue during our launch timeframe, and their team (specifically Marcus) got back to us within about 20-30 minutes. We have a complex Shopify theme, and they took the time to analyze our issue and efficiently resolve the problem. 10 out of 10 recommend!"
"Junip is a beautiful app that puts customer experience first and despite our theme being highly customized and not off the shelf whatsoever, the onboarding process has been truly amazing and painless. We switched to Junip from another (larger) review platform and haven't looked back since. So glad we did because the customer / merchant interface is way more aesthetic, customisable, logical and the best thing of all is that the cost of Junip is 1/4 cheaper than what I used to pay!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
"Junip is EASILY the best option for collecting reviews on Shopify. It's largely the value they offer for their price, while giving a large chunk of the features I need. Integrations with Klaviyo, Google Ads, easy to use interface, great user experience -- all reason I love this software. The support team and owner are very smart and helpful. It is confusing how much competitors charge and how little you get."
"so easy to install and the must for any ecomerce.
If you want a chance as a start up you have to give rewards and referral.
Rewards will get you loyalty from your customers and referrals.
Thanks for this so accessible interface.
With Shopify, everything is made easy!"
"This app is amazing. I got reviews right away from customers in the middle of the night. The interface for both me as a merchant and my customers is modern and refreshing and fully customizable. Their customer service is so quick and helpful, they resolved my issue in 5 mins. 10/10 recommend. I might even make a Tiktok/Youtube recommending it."
"Definitely a great app for customer loyalty and retention. Their customer support is great and very responsive, always returning your emails and try to do their best to resolve your issues. Although you already can find the core features which you might expect from a loyalty program, they are keen on developing new functionalities for the app. Plus this is the only loyalty app on the market which supports modifying and translating every bit of information in your customer-facing interface of the program. I can't recommend it more."
"This app has been fantastic so far, you really need to grab it while it is being promised for $19.95 a month forever for shopify customers.
Their customer service replies are superb and I am more than willing to wait anxiously for the facebook functionality and other features. 
There is a little question mark? at the bottom left of the app where you can contact support - it lets you vote on ideas to come - very clean and fun interface
This page here http://feedback.loyaltylion.com/forums/217155-feature-requests also shows the requested features and their progress.
I highly recommend these guys."
Beautiful mobile user interfaces and all the features of the top review apps (like UGC/upload photos) are available here! The difference is Junip has these features at a fraction of the price of their competitors. Time to stop getting ripped off by the other apps and switch to Junip!
"So far, a very good experience. Easy install, clean interface, works well on Parallax theme. Great job guys."
"We are about to launch our site https://www.bhuman.store/ and we absolutely love this app. We came across it quite randomly, saw the 200+ reviews and decided we MUST try it. The Honeycomb team has incredible customer service, even though we are in different time zones. They assisted us promptly - thanks Jonathan and Itai - and are always helpful. The interface is easy to use, with clear instructions. They even offered to get their designer to create an interface that perfectly matched our brand colors for FREE. Incredible, thank you Lynda. From one small business owner to you, we hope your funnel can help us during these challenging covid times. THANK YOU!"
False advertising and crooked upselling! I signed up for the $1.99 plan which claimed to offer unlimited use only to find we can only upload 21 images and being told to upgrade to $4.99. Your interface looks outdated...unprofessional and you have spelling errors everywhere! Absolutely terrible app!
Great app for displaying our commissioned projects and wonderful customer support. The only thing I would suggest is adding sub-galleries with a scrolling option for an even better user experience. :)
"MailMunch has been great: easy to install, easy elegant user interface, easy MailChimp integration. Only a good experience!"
"This app has improved my site's speed by over 30%!  It's easy to use and the interface is super user friendly.  Support is great - they are quick to respond, knowledgeable and polite. 
Overall - the monthly price is well worth it!"
"Refersion is one of the most user-friendly suites for affiliate marketing I have ever seen. and I have seen a lot of them.
The only point of improvement would be if they made the payments themselves and all I had to do was link my credit card so they could charge it for the commissions. Or if they had a prepaid system I could top up, and they'd use that to pay the affiliates. 
But the interface is beautiful
All the features are amazing
And Emma from Customer Support is a true hero. 
Really chuffed so far about the experience and the service.
Kiiroo.com is very happy to use Refersion. Ace product."
Please update the tutorial on upsell and cashier.  Interface has changed.  It's difficult to setup while following along in the video.
"Bold Upsell is an incredibly easy-to-use interface, and has increased our revenue drastically since we began using it. Pairing up our various products has worked wonders for conversion and allowed us to capitalize on high-spending customers."
"useful app with an intelligent interface, and fair pricing plans which lets you try the app before paying."
User friendly app and the interface is good. The support & response time is very good! The staff are very polite and patient to resolve the issues and quite knowlegable.
"This size chart app is just awesome. In fact I Wish I had installed it a long time ago. It's very intuitive and it gets the job done. Simple interface with lots of features to personalize the size charts. I can create size charts that can be applied to multiple products (by tag or collection, for example) and it's easy to clone one and make small modifications for a similar product. Support has been stellar the few times I needed help. Very happy customer. Much recommended!"
"I liked how this reviews app worked and the interface is really clean and comfortable. Very good costumer service, i would suggest to improve and expand the options to change colors and all the customizable stuff!"
great app! easy to install and user friendly interface. can be recommended for installing on your shopify webstore.
I would definitely recommend this app. It is easy to customize and the user interface looks great. You can upload reviews from other platforms in the admin panel
Needed something simple and aesthetic and was happy to see that this was a free app to use. Easy interface and customizable colours.
"**UPDATE 17th OCT 2020 ** I am now dropping the rating to one star. Some very important functions of the app have ground to a halt and support has been absolutely abysmal. Time is really precious, and you cannot manage and support your own vendors in a timely way when critical elements of this platform just fail and your support requests just disappear into generic 1 line responses. Sure they have gotten back to me in some regard but it's in no way sufficient. Seriously you get better support at Mcdonalds. I kid you not I actually started a programming diploma to engineer something 1000000x better than this in the future, ego aside anyone can see that they have included way too many under developed features instead of spending the time making the core structure bullet proof. I would much rather a small set of high functionality features than such a huge mess of trashy overpriced features, who wouldn't? This sucks, you suck. Be better. **ORIGINAL REVIEW**
So i have been working on this app for a couple of weeks now, and im seriously torn between a few aspects. Firstly I will say the support so far has been good, it's not 'drop of a hat' but with basic issues solved in a reasonable time you cant really complain with that. Shopify is not overly suitable for designing a Marketplace on, if from the ground up you where able to implement a custom /proprietary enterprise grade solution then sure you could end up with a quality product. MVM does a very good job at adapting shopify's functions in some things and extremely poor in others, mostly to do with User interface and customization (fitting with your theme or design) they DO provide some tools and a HTML & CSS editor for different aspects, if you are not a developer then you will have to hire expert help to reach your visual and functional goals. When they say ""like Amazon, Ebay, Etsy.."" this is a GROSS overstatement considering the quality of development and feature's on those platforms you will seriously struggle to come close to the same or similar in performance. The vendor's portal (UI) is so basic I actually am dreading having to present it to my future vendors to use, it's embarrassing! So overall it's a great concept, again with some functions really well implemented and the feature app's costs are not too much of a bother as comparatively to other platforms it works out to be fairly priced with function VS price. BUT now I have done so much customization myself its beginning to look like more of a quality product, seriously I warn you though, perhaps if you are interested in starting a marketplace take a look at Arcadier, Marketplacer, cs.cart or store hippo. All of which ARE NOT shopify apps, they are stand alone solutions and could save you a massive headache. I have contacted support with my ridiculously long feature request and complaints, and will happily update this to 5 stars if ultimately i get what i want."
"I own a fashion store and I don't normally write a review. Kiwi is one of the app I wish I discovered it earlier. It save me a lot fo time to figure out how to implement a size chart to the products. It has many great features although I still do not have time to play with each of them. The development team is great and are very nice people. They response quickly on the chat and they help me to solved a small issue with the interface, the action was so quick and I will definitely try the ultimate version in the future.
Update: 4 Jan 2020, still using it and already upgraded to Ultimate plan, the app has been updated from time to time and it just keep improving. There are so many details in setting, almost anything I can think of are already there!"
"This app is absolutely incredible. We originally installed it to delay sending customer feedback emails after purchase, as well as vendor notifications on our orders. Since then have founds hundreds of different ways we can use this tool to make our experience for customers superior! It has a simple interface and is easy to use from the outset. What's more is the customer support for this app is excellent, Keiran was very quick to respond to our queries and suggest ways of getting the most from the app. Highly recommended - 5 stars!"
recently uploaded haven't had the full extent of use as yet but interface is very good. try it for yourself
I recently switched to Sesami to handle my strategy session bookings. It was easy to set up and has a simple client-facing interface. I had some questions during my set up and both the customer support and development team went above and beyond to help me out!
I love this app. It has made a difference in my business. The interface is simple to use and very complete.
What I loved about chatra is their interface. Its intuitive and their support staff is quick and responsive. Icing on the cake: They don't talk in code and they understand you might not be from a coding background.
"Excellent app, easily laid out in a useable modern interface and should you encounter any difficulties, the tech support is spot-on willing to help to perfect any task. Highly recommend this program."
Love this app! Installed last week and I've already seen an increase in sales. Interface is very easy to use and intuitive.
"I’m happy to be back on the Magenative app platform. I’ve used them in the past and was disappointed in the slow response time (I must say has improved GREATLY) and that caused me to switch platforms. The platform I switched to looked good but they lack some important features such as scheduling post and it would always freeze up not to mention some links didn’t work. So I figured I’ll go back and try the Magenative platform again and to my surprise the response time has improved as I stated before, but I was even more impressed/excited to see there was completely new and redesigned panel which works even smoother than before and has a cleaner interface. Oh yeah I almost forgot about the option of integration features they have incorporated. They also have some of the best pricing."
"I have emailed them an inquiry if they could add free consultation sessions and stylist schedules without Adding to Cart and Check Out like a transaction. I got an email and asked if I could provide collaborator code which I happily replied right away. That was a week ago and I am as yet to hear form anyone. I published the app and showed it to everyone in my team from marketing to sales. They all found the interface was not exactly user-friendly and super weird to ask for check out a shopping cart when the consultation is free. There was probably a way to solve it but due to the lack of response, I was never able to get the help I was asking for. It left me with no choice but to delete the app. It's frustrating when an app doesn't have a chat function to walk you through any question and worse, being unresponsive in email replied. The app supposes to make booking appointment easy but unfortunately it just doesn't work out for my company."
Just installed this app. Installation was smooth hope it gets me some customers back. Nice interface
"I used this app to create a more responsive and intuitive FAQs page and it helped me execute it perfectly. The amount of design customisation allows me to match it to my theme seamlessly. This app will betters your customers' user experience because they'll be able to find their specific FAQs from categories and the search bar. I tried to make my own FAQs page before but it was becoming a dissertation haha. 
Also, 10 FAQs is actually very generous on the Free plan. I've only used 6 so far. Definitely get it! It's brilliant."
I am using this app from the day I started by journey in Print on demand. I really love the interface and its very simple to understand the process and add the products on your shopify store. The best product which I didn't find any where is the 500 Piece Jigsaw Puzzle. Podify is the only POD store that sells 500 Pcs jigsaw puzzles and Passport holders. Podify will be my first service. The customer service is very quick that they are always available. I recommend Podify for any POD needs. Thank you Podify.
"I tried another app before this one without much luck.  So far this one seems to work well after a bit of tweaking the set-up.  Don't forget to check the abandoned cart time under set-up.  I am running the free version and it seems to be everything we need for our store.  I like the user interface and the dashboard is set-up nicely.  I only wish the ""paid"" options weren't visible if you have the free version but hey - they want to make money too :)"
An app is only as good as the support. Cara here is a rockstar! Wow. We got set up super fast and the interface is so intuitive! Thank you.
Really nice app and so easy to use!! The Interface is simple and the design is really easy to see and use. Thanks for this wonderful app!
"Easy to install and works instantly upon each refresh. However, the user interface takes getting used to and it is not as straightforward as I'd like it to be. It they can improve the backend, it would be marvellous!"
"SEO Manger is one of the few absolute 'mission critical' apps every Shopify store should have installed.
For us, SEO Manager is one of the go-to tools to make sure that our SEO efforts are implemented in the best possible way.
Other benefits include
> Easy to set up
> Intuitive user interface
> Great customer / technical service"
"THE best app I've added in terms of generating extra sales. Lovely, simple interface....an absolute MUST HAVE app."
Some of the best customer service I've ever received from an app! They resolve my problems within minutes and make sure it's to our liking! The wishlist interface is also so perfect for my customers to save products to come back to later and works perfectly! Recommend 10/10! Thank you:)
"Belle interface graphique,  fluide et customizable. Laisse une impression de sérieux sur la boutique. Je ne regrette pas mon achat."
"Absolutely brilliant customer support, fastest we have dealt with along with a beautiful User interface. Thank you to the team!"
"First and foremost, the customer service for this app is phenomenal. I am so impressed with the responsiveness and the tremendous support received after reaching out for assistance implementing this with our template. Every aspect of this app has fused so well with our website, it looks as though the wishlist feature has always been there. I am confident this app will provide a better user experience for our guests. Not to mention the value add to our business from the app's robust reporting features. Knowing which items our customers are adding to their wishlists provides great insight for future planning. Thank you Wishlist Plus, this has been both a positive experience and a worthy investment."
"Used this app to answer all of my clients question without hassle will result in an easier user experience, less client frustration and will save a lot of my time thank you!"
"one word is ""awesome"". Very easy to use, simple interface. Test phase. will open to instagram shortly."
"Love this app. A gorgeous and easy-to-follow interface + great support + beautiful style options + tons of popup flexibility set Pixelpop apart from other options in the app store. Our site's visual design and character is a huge priority for us, and these popups integrated seamlessly. Would highly recommend - a huge value-add for us."
"A great app with a beautiful and super easy to use interface. Awesome support, who are always willing to help with supplying code to customise our popups further so they match the styling of our site. Worth the money!"
"Wonderful app and customer service!  When we were running into issues loading all of our items, they went ahead and fixed the bug without us asking and improved their interface to make it easier to manage! Wow!"
Pixelpop is very user interface friendly and EXTREMELY easy to use. It can support having different purposes for a popup and the graphics are all very professional.
"Great app. Does exactly as advertised and I like all the features. Backend interface is very clean. Would
Love to see more templates and the ability to add basic HTML tags to text field. Other than that two thumbs up...err 5 stars!"
A cart recovery tool is a must and this app is easy to install and the interface is very clean and user friendly.
"Beautiful simplistic interface! No Sha-La-La !
Love how I can edit my stuff . Awesome App! 
Value for money - CHECK!"
"I am really enjoying the help received by using this app to my work, as it ""does"" rightly everything, has a very friendly interface and capacity, and assistance (Max) was fast and wonderful, solving immediately a little defect. I couldn't end my store without this app, thanks so much!!"
This app is just speechlessly amazing. The very simple and clean interface is easy to edit even if you're not proficient in coding at all like me. I was using another translation app for my bilingual site and it was literally a nightmare with continuous errors. This app is totally compatible with your primary Shopify language so there won't be any missed words for translation. Plus the automatic translations are already so natural. The support team is always quick to respond and help me solve all my problems. Can't appreciate more!
"Tried several translation apps and finally took this one. In general, it works as stated, app gives possibility to edit translated text in full. I didn't find essential negative examples during using it. Some minor issues in user interface. The main and essential value for this app it is a customer support. It is really helpful, and they are never sending generic advices but fully helping including editing of page. This part of experience truly priceless."
"One of the best translation app on shopify. Easy to use interface, author is helpful. Would recommend it."
"Updated - I attempted to give the app a second shot after support reached out. Turns out that uploading a product photo was a compulsory step but there was nothing to highlight this fact. I'm updating the review to 3 stars as I got the app to work, however, the product page doesn't use your existing theme's product page. It creates a new product page that required customization. Not quite what I was looking for but I appreciate the responsiveness from support. If I had time to engage support further I'm sure they could get this review higher, this is just my frank evaluation of the app with little experience. The UI does need some work.
Old-""Unable to save bundle"" - the interface of this app is confusing and in the end it wouldn't even create the bundle I required. This app feels like it is still in testing, the key features for 3rd party fulfilment is still in 'beta' which doesn't say on the app's sale page anywhere."
This is the best product bundling app that I've worked with.  Has a native shopify interface that will make you feel comfortable with using it and so far has had all the different features and rules I've been looking for.
"A mixed bag, I really liked the interface and how easy it was to format emails. However the Abandoned Cart emails are a car crash, when viewed in Outlook the images are huge. Privy Support are unable to rectify saying it's an Outlook issue. Other Privy emails with images worked fine in Outlook. Had to move to another app, despite it being very promising at first. Awarded just two stars, because the Abandoned Cart is so important and if they can't get that right..."
"Does everything we need it to do with a simple and clean interface. No other bundle apps we've found let you have a proper product page for the bundle and this is vital to the way we make our grouped products.
Also, had a very silly support request and David A was in touch with a really polite and friendly explanation within the hour. 
Great app; you get what you pay for."
"We've been using Privy for almost a year to help boost our email opt-ins, manage email automation's and provide a better over-all user experience. Having a single tool to manage so many elements all in one has been a game-changer. Highly recommend this platform for any growing business."
"Valerii and the team have been very helpful with the support. The user experience is occasionally a little buggy and could use a little more refinement however, the support is very quick to rectify and can achieve this most of the time. Disappointing that the created bundle product pages are slow to load along with slow to display the widgets on these pages. The simple user experience functionality for change of colour for ""hover over checkout button"" and ""change checkout button colour on click"" cannot be achieved and confirmed by the support team which is also very disappointing and is expected by the user for user feedback response. I found on testing that this poor experience sometimes suggests that the button does not work if there is a slow browser advancement to the checkout page. This reflects poorly on your site user experience. Of the host of ""bundle"" apps that I have tried, this app has the most flexibility and seems to offer the best bundle configurations for the Shopify Merchant."
"equipe atenciosa, sanaram todas as minhas dúvidas, estão sempre dispostos a ajudar via chat, recomendo o app. e além disso a interface é muito intuitiva. parabéns a equipe"
"I'm using this app to increase my conversion rate and it really did his job every time. The ROI is insanely high. Support is always there. I really like to use this app, easy user interface and easy set-up"
i used this app to build my store and it is very good. the interface is very user friendly and i love it.
"Extremely easy to use. Interfaces with Shopify well. Only reason I cannot give them a 5 star review is because there is no phone support. In today's fast paced business world, having a person you can talk to is paramount."
Love this app and the customer service is very responsive and open to user interface feedback. I definitely recommend it!
"I was pleased with this app's support from the very first moment! 
They agreed to integrate my native language (I sent them translations) and made this up and running within 2 working days!
I am very pleased with the interface since it is easy to navigate. App is highly customizable and the support is awesome!!! :)"
"Super nice app! provide cool user experiences, good product, easy to use, easy to install, let s see the response !:)"
"If you're looking for an incredible app with an incredible support team, MBC Bundles is for you! We have already seen an increase in revenue after just one month of bundling with MBC. The interface is incredibly easy, and any issues I've hit have been quickly and professionally handled by the MBC support team. HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
We are very pleased with Webgility and how it interfaces with Quickbooks.  They have excellent support if you have any questions.
"Good So Far, Easy to use and easy to navigate straight forward interface and love the amount of integration the app had to shopify"
"I found this app after I trialed multiple bundler apps and this is the only one that offered me the functionality I was looking for in a interface that was easy to use and manage. Their greatest strength, however, is the excellent customer service that is offered. I have been back and forth with queries on how to adapt the app in my store environment and each query has been addressed effectively and patiently. A special thanks to Valerie for the great support."
"I really like Privy and what it can do. I find it's interface and logic a lot easier than some other apps. However, with their pricing, I am now paying quite a bit...and I dont think is quite worth it. Not for my business anyway. AND it sucks on mobile... which is annoying as this is my side hussle and sometimes i need to just jump on my phone to action stuff and this makes it really hard. Would love to see improvements on mobile interface."
"This is an excellent app! We are going to uninstall the other bundle app that we were using !! Great pricing. Great support - they helped us custom format the widget to our theme, with extremely prompt support. Thank you!! FEATURE: Bundle Builder - this is a great feature within the app, and we are looking forward to color and font customization coming to this feature within the app. Excellent admin interface, love the combo product option where you can use the shopify product page to have a combo product appear on collections pages as well. Keep it up and we look forward to more features and custom options. 5 star app!"
Great app! really easy to use with a very nice interface. This will be great for my customers to easily contact me and gain trust when visiting my store
"I don't find it very user friendly, with a confusing interface. Also making me to upgrade (and pay) basically because of my view count so will be uninstalling. I have gotten an insane amount of emails since installing and a phone call. I personally fine that aggressive and annoying. I know they are trying to help but I found it overwhelming and confusing. I get how it can be great for some but not my type of business I guess."
"Although the interface is a bit cumbersome, the technical aspects work like they're supposed to. It's the design side that is a disaster. Whether it's pop ups or emails, the options are very limited and feel dated. So far the technical support response has been to tell me that the reason images I try to upload appear blurry is because f my computer's HD/Retina screen..."
"Nikhlesh was very helpful, patient, and professional while helping me with our Webgility issues. Webgility is a great software program that reduces manual entry of our orders into Quickbooks. Absolute time saver. Nikhlesh is very knowledgeable with the interface of Webgility and Quickbooks and Shopify. Nikhlesh assisted as much has he could and this resulted in solving my issues."
Easy to understand interface. Developers are very responsive to any issues. Plus this one just looked the best with my theme - I use the Wokiee theme
"Highly recommend this app.
- the AI translation is very good, much better compare to other apps which translate like Google translate
- Easy to use interface. Love the bulk options edit function. Really helpful especially your store has many products/variants
- Free translation (although there is a limit, but it will renew monthly) Super helpful support, many thanks to Max. He quickly response and even further help us to fix an issue with our theme which is not in his scope. Would definitely recommend this app to everyone."
"I've been always skeptical about any back in stock app because of the dysfunctional of the email or sms BIS alert we have experienced with other app. This app is absolutely amazing. The fact that it will alert customer within 1 min after stock arrival is super user friendly. Also, they provide easy button to adjust button interface. You don't need any coding at all. They have live chat box that support team responses within a min or two. Highly recommended"
"Très facile à prendre en main grâce au tuto, et gratuite ! L'interface est facilitée au maximum pour aider les affiliés."
"Useful app with a nice interface.
The support team help you at the speed of light!!
5 stars deserved!!!"
Customer service is either hit or miss with all these apps on shopify. This app definitely hits on the customer service side. There is a chat button on the app interface and they are always quick to respond and very helpful.
Installing the app now. So far good customer service and easy to use interface.
"It is a joy to use your app. The user interface is really easy to use, and beautiful on the eyes. Keep up the really really amazing work!"
"I have just installed it.
I really enjoy its user-friendly interface.
I look forward to a top-notch performance! :)"
"Mighty Impressive App! I have just installed the app, and the features it offers are mind-blowing! Being able to add a second and third reminder to every abandoned cart is a very cool feature! The interface is excellent too. Good work team"
"Looks great so far, very easy interface!"
"I really love using LayoutHub. It makes designing the user interface of your site a breeze. You just have to be careful not to get lost in the whirlwind of design options, and for creatives, that's easy to do. My only disappointment was that I had issues with getting support before and became discouraged. Today I needed to lean on support again, and I got an agent named Emily. She was so helpful that I decided to leave my first Shopify app store review. I had an issue that I spent days trying to solve myself. Emily helped me find exactly what I was looking for in minutes. She saved me from so much wasted time, headache, and heartache . Cheers to you giving his app a try."
"Absolutely top-notch app, easy to install, easy interface, and gave me comprehensive information and great suggestions on how to optimize my SEO."
"This app allowed us to customize our product listings, which provides a better user experience when filtering products on our store. Thanks!"
An application with a convenient and simple interface. A large number of settings. A very useful function of sending letters to customers with a message to leave a review. The support team works great. I turned to them to solve one problem and they did everything very quickly. Don't forget that the app is free. Thanks to the developers. Verdict: Recommended.
Its a good app and support is really kind and very helpful with any issue you enocunter. Good app and much better interface then many competitors.
"Works as described, great option if you need to mess around with metafields in a tidy interface."
"This metafields manager is robust and easy to use with a slick user interface. Install the app, create some fields and enter some values, pretty easy. Was able to create some fields for my products and edit the theme code to display them on my product pages. Even greater is their quick responding and friendly support team who helped resolve my issue. Thanks!!"
"Easy to setup, easy to use. The interface to create your own chatbot is really cool and user friendly! I immediately was able to use this to chat with some customers and add additional items they were looking for without leaving my website, keeping them engaged. First day the app paid for itself."
"We are still in our free trial period, but the app was easy and quick to install and get up and running. We were able to view our site visitors within minutes and have been chatting with our customers since installation. So far we have even gotten a sale in the first 24 hours based on our trial of the product. I am not 100% about email marketing, but I am used to Mailchimp and may have to get used to the interface is different."
Easy to use interface that does the job well. Super friendly customer service that helps you with any questions you have!
"This is a great app, I'm already getting to see what the user experience is. I now know I need to focus on a strong mobile site. It has also helped me figure out when to utilize pop-ups."
I used this app to improve my store user interface. Nice app to track the activities of your customer. I recommend every shopify user to use this app
"This is one of the best apps I have ever installed on my store. It is easy to install, it features an elegant interface, integrates well within the site and full of options that makes selling more efficient."
"I LOVE THIS APP, Unlike other apps Replay is easy to understand with clean graphics and a super-easy user experience. They also give a much larger monthly limit than the other apps. This is definitely an addition you need for your store!"
"Great app. Easy to use. I hope we get heat maps soon.
The interface is very user friendly and looks nice."
"Edit: Thanks so much for listening to my feedback about the favicon being difficult to see, and then amending changes. Awesome. I still find the new changes to the UI hard to read and a more unpleasant user experience, plus the extra click to view sessions is annoying, but other than that, this app has helped me understand and fix my site issues really quickly and that's invaluable. Don't know where I'd be without it."
"This app is incredible! Easy to install & use. Simple interface for editing. And the support is friendly and fast. Hands-down, the best FAQ app for Shopify."
"Esta aplicação é fantástica! Os ficheiros chegam até nós prontos a imprimir com grande resolução. O interface fácil e intuitivo, excelente suporte também. Era exatamente isto que queria."
Support Team is very helpful! The tab is very easy to use and the interface is very friendly. Highly recommend!
Has no mobile interface. We tried to message support but did not hear back sadly. Its a shame because desktop looks great.
We use this a app for custom drinks and masks Shopify stores and it works like promoted. The support ist quick and helpfull and the features are all we need for a good user experience. With the 3d mode you have a nice feature to show the clients more.
"The best customization app. Unfortunately, there aren't many apps that support the 3D preview and across them, the Zakeke has the best user experience and configuration flexibility.
Also, they had good support who helped me with refunding when I accidentally missed my billing cycle expiration."
"App interface is beautiful and easy to navigate. I love that I can upload my own fonts and cliparts. Their template feature saves a lot of time too.
Tech support are friendly and always ready to help. Looking forward to more features soon!"
"It's a great app and easy to use once you've created a few test products. The interface is very intuitive and clean, would definitely recommend.
The support team is very helpful if you run into any issues."
"Its been a few months since we started using Zakeke and we feel like this review deserves a revision.
We have a love-hate relationship with this app, i gotta tell you, this app is very technical (at least for our purpose). If you are a web-developer working for a client (store owner) then be prepared for a challenge!
Please don't panic, we still rated this app 5 stars even with all our complains. Lol.
First of all, if you have zero ""computer"" skills and you have no idea how to use Photoshop and you need to search online what is a .OBJ file, please do yourself a favor and stop reading - this review is not meant for you. Hire a web developer and ask him to read this review on your behalf.
Ill continue assuming you will understand what ill describe ahead.
Zakeke is an intermediary interface designed to allow direct customer interaction (for the purpose of aesthetic modification) before sending a product to the cart. Zakeke will not draw the product from your store inventory, so instead the product have to be created in Zakeke then placed on inventory for your customers to select and customize. Zakeke will automatically embed a ""customize"" button on your product.liquid so your customers will see the option to customize the product on the product page before sending the product to their cart. When a customer click on the customize button Zakeke will load your presets for that product and take the customer to the customization interface from where they can customize the product and send it to the cart.
Sounds good, right?
Well... here comes the ""challenge"" part.
The easy way to work with Zakeke is drawing products from CustomCat and/or Printful. Don't worry, there is an option on the Zakeke dashboard to help you do that. Pretty easy - really. But lets say you want to add a product manually, lets say a product not available on CustomCat or Printful, perhaps a product you can source yourself? Well, you will need to take your own pictures > create mask layers on .PNG > then ""build"" your product on Zakeke. This process has to be done by an expert (on photo editing) otherwise you will end up with a bad looking product on store display or with a mismatch on your product-mask for the customization interface.
Zakeke will take and display .OBJ files for mesh rendering but does not includes a 3D editor. You need those files including your textures before using its 3D function. Zakeke does not includes pre-rendered objects or textures.
This app has a learning curve and i believe they could have done a better job assembling the UI, however patience can be rewarding with this app. I gotta say this app is pretty unique on Shopify and will open a door of possibilities that your customers will certainly appreciate.
Just plan ahead, learn how Zakeke works and take your time asking question to support - they always answer, and that's great because the app does not need to be perfect, it need to be functional and they will help you along the way.
I strongly recommend Zakeke and this is my honest review after many months of trial and error.
If you would like to see Zakeke in action you are welcome to visit our shop www.novocaseshop.com and try it for yourself.
Cheers.

First review: 3 Stars
Just downloaded and installed... and im so confused. This app has a steep learning curve. What is a ""side""? I dont know - the app does not explain. How to use 3D models? I dont even know if my plan has those because i dont see the option.
Im confused and annoyed. My experience so far is not what i read on reviews :/
There is a video tutorial section - that i must admit is very helpful, but be prepared to spend some time there.
Im taking down two stars from my review. Initial impression is not good. UI need a serious overhaul to make this app more user friendly.
I will update my review as my experience progress."
"Gorgias is a must have for any business that wants to stay in business. The automation of answering repetitive daily messages from customers is by far a game changer. No more tedious and redundant responses that you have to deal with. The interface itself is clear and clean for those in your organization to utilize with ease. Lastly, their team behind this App is hands down the best we have ever worked with. Quick response time with the solution to your problem(s)."
Pretty sweet. Their customer support has been great. The user interface isn't super beautiful but it's super functional. We've been able to integrate most of our customer communication channels into one platform.
"I have loved my experience with Gorgias so far. I've used MANY helpdesks with MANY bells and whistles and I'm really excited about my decision to go with Gorgias. The interface is simple. Everything is condensed into one place.  Integration took 5 minutes (which is truly unheard of) and the customer experience is exceptional. I've been working with (harassing) Aasif for the last few months and he is always kind, down to earth, and more than willing to help. He is there for technical support as well as general e-comm advice and for me, that was a key differentiator. I never felt like my experience was overly salesy- it always felt friend to friend.  Gorgias is continuing to innovate and push the boundaries and I'm excited to see how we scale with them."
"I have searched for lots of apps here on Shopify and other sites to allow some online editing for customers customize their products, and this was the best one. Very easy to use, clean interface, fair monthly subscription and very easy going and kind staff, they helped me in all my needs and they listen a lot for all suggestions, really great staff! I really recommend this app!"
"In my opinion Easy Tabs is the best tab app on the shopify. Works perfekt, easy instalation, easy interface."
Nice dashboard and friendly user interface. Was pretty simple to fix the SEO issues ! Also a very good support !
"""Uncompareable UI & user-intuitive design""
Shopney has hit the bullseye in terms of finding the right amount of perfect in developing an app for our store in a jiffy. Support's so cool, you might just find a new friend in their support.
Improvements post Shopney;
1. 10% increased revenues in under 1st week, organically.
2. Reduced customer buy-time.
3. Delightful consumer experience with various app sections that are unimaginably customizable.
4. Has a very premium feel overall - highly recommended for a premium brand.
5. Better brand recognition as the UI is very unique.
Pro's
1. Fits all pockets
2. User friendly
3. Loved the support team - Hi5 to Lara!
4. Mobile app help generate notifications in a blink & on the go.
5. Requires Zero Coding
6. Helpful user guides to onboard & further
7. Theme's and color options are quick and easy to apply & use.
8. Preview app saves a lot of time in understanding the look and feel of the app.
9. Seemless app update - within seconds of you hit the ""publish"" you'll see the app interface update. - great of websites that have weekly offers or even daily updates!
Con's (More like suggestions)
1. Require deep link generation on the go (i.e. in the app)
2. Font in the app - on some screens - can look hazy - a notch thicker font would do miracles.
3. Need more collapsable menu's & the discount coupon 4. More integrations required - (bundle products, frequently bought together, upsells)
5. Deeplinks for blogs required.
6. Should be able to redirect within the app for blogs & news section.
7. Simple contact us page or blank pages - a minimum of 1 per plan can help a lot.
8. A way to edit the app in the mobile interface would be great. Summary - I would love to see the app grow with time & enable people like us to have an affordable alternative to creating an app in a jiffy! Thank you team Shopney! Love,
Nakul Khairnar

I am very happy with the basic functionality of this App. It covers all of the basics very quickly and with a simple to use interface. The assistance to resolve issues is also very valuable.
"Nice and smooth app designing interface, plus the customer support staff is very helpful and friendly. highly recommended for anyone who wants to turn business into app."
"I tried many other apps to create a mobile app for my website. So far none was like Shopney. Easy interface, pretty straight forward and most importantly you can customize your app however you want. Prices? Pretty fair for all of the features you can get out of this awesome app. I enrolled into the gold plan, and I'm pretty happy about it! Their support time is very cooperative and helpful with quick response times. Special thanks to Hazel as she is very patient with my questions.
If you are looking to launch an app for your store, go with Shopney!"
"We have been using this app to build a mobile app for our customers- it provides a simple and clean design interface, very decent UI features, and most importantly, great customer support from Melissa and the team."
header bar is free great tool to help enhance your user experience
"I love shopney and I am using it for my grocery delivery company Buypify groceries. The interface clean and neat and the process is very easy to understand anybody can simply make a mobile app with these guys. Especially there is support representative Malissa, she answered every question I asked and helped me my entire process from design to deployment to app stores, Just 5-star rating for customer service. I love to recommend this to others."
"ShopPad is a great app and its interface is very user friendly. I like that it gives you the option to create ecommerce solutions for either mobile, tablet or both. It's a beneficial app and I would suggest it to anyone who wants to maximize their mobile and tablet sales."
"Easy to install, great and straight forward mobile interface. thumbs up!"
"Great App.  I've tried several from the App store and this one is fast, with a very usable interface.  The price can't be beat and the development team responded quickly to my inquiries."
100% does what it says. easiest interface ever for creating any gallery. Far better than any gallery out there in the store.
"This app does every report I hoped it would and more. Easy, intuitive interface and awesome support. Ask and you shall receive."
"Used a few competitors before this app and this is by far the best - great interface, easy to use and awesome support. 5 stars from us - thanks heaps!"
Great app，Friendly interface，It has obvious help to increase the customer unit price，highly recommended。
"A+ App 
Very easy to use
Being non code savvy - having a web interface to then cut/paste code into the shopify platform was amazing."
"Very happy with this plugin. Customizable and easy to use. We needed a tweak to functionality and customer service got back to us immediately. I will say that the interface for including or excluding products is clunky and manual (for example, you can't filter by collection), but we want the app to apply to all products so it's not an issue for us. Well worth $5/month."
"First of all, many people believe Bold have the monopoly on this type of App.  Not true.  I checked them ALL, and there is *one* other that is comparable.  We went with Bold because we had less problems getting it to work to begin with.  It is difficult, cumbersome and fiddly to get everything set up and working correctly if you choose the Auto option, but if you know your way around Liquid you'll get there.  
Support genuinely seem to want to help, they're just not very good at it.  I get the impression there are support personnel Tiers and when you get moved up a tier you have to re-explain the whole situation to them, despite a recorded history of text and submitted video files.  One bug on their end that caused their backend to hang forever in certain circumstances took about a month to fix.
Swatches are nice, but very bare boned functionality.  The boxes even at 'Large' setting are very small (about 50x50px) and there is no hover-over functionality allowing a better look at the image.  When I suggested this basic user experience feature (which if I had access to the Liquid code I could have fixed in a single line) they said they'd pass it on, but ultimately it was a custom feature request we'd have to pay for.  I eventually got a solution running in three lines of CSS.
While parts of the code are stored in your theme files, you can't improve them because they are overwritten by Bold sometimes multiple times a day, so you are at their mercy for basic functionality adjustments.  You are given an outlet for custom CSS and that is all.
The most constantly noticeable issue is that the back end is hosted on Bold servers and is extremely cumbersome to load, and to navigate.  You can have an Option Set, which contains a list of Options, and those Options can have a list of products (in the case of automatic price adjustments).  You can't alter a product through Shopify normally because all the data for the Option Sets are stored on Bold servers and they don't know the change occurred.  You are required to alter products through the interface provided by Bold.  
Every time you make any change through the Bold interface, everything connected to that change needs to be updated.  If you change a product in an Option, every Option Set that is linked to that Option needs to be updated.  If you change a product in an Option and that product is also in other Options, you need to manually go into those Options and save them so the changes will be recognised. 
Every change you make requires a long waiting period where the system goes up the tree and readjusts everything internally - the more Options in the Option Set, the more Option Sets the Options are used in and the more products within an Option, the longer the wait.  We're talking a minimum of 5 seconds for the most simplistic of Sets, and a minute or two for complicated branches.
Finally, changes made (especially when actually applying these Option Sets to the store front products) take often up to 10 minutes to actually be reflected on the web site - and some times they just don't take at all.  Some times you just have to go back in and save the Sets again hoping this time it will work.
Overall, the App works mostly well as far as front end code goes (although a lot of modifications were required to get everything working as expected on our non-Shopify bought theme, a task I expect most people aren't up to).  Almost all of the issues come from a complicated and cumbersome imperfect back end, and Bolds reluctance to improve their product as noted by other reviews - which is inexcusable for a subscription product.  But when it's working, it shows the potential to be something of great use."
Awesome app! Very user friendly & nice interface as well. Really looking forward to seeing the results it brings
Great app! Love the automated emails when item is back available. Easy to use interface too! Easy to install!
"I have not fully utilized this tool for a historical reference however, upon first review this has all the simple COGS needs you could really ask for!  The default margin for cost is also a very nice simple feature on top of the ability to account for cost of items and variants!  The interface is simple and what shopify lacks natively, bravo!"
"This app is really slick. Great interface, easy to use. It took me just a few minutes to love it."
"Great product and great team! they are keen to try and help improve my business so that is win-win, highly recommend. The interface is nice and easy to understand and super easy to install and run! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
I am totally impressed with this app! no only that their application has all the best features and very modern interface but their customer support went an extra mile while helping me to adjust the app specifically for my store. Amazing!
"Amazing team and app! I used to use Loox.. but quite annoyed with their huge prices and ugly interface. Versus this app allowed me to have review app in my store like in 10minutes, everything looks awesome and they even suggested to add some COOL features in the future!"
"Great app, With user-friendly interface. The whole process from syncing the orders to dispatched the orders done in bulk manner within few minutes. Great work guys and keep helping us in same manner."
"Great app for shipping automation. Easy to use, hassle-free interface. Prompt customer service and response."
"App is functional and easy to integrate so far, looking forward to be able to do more customization on interface and message in the future."
"This app made our order processing very easy, saves lot of time, good user interface. Thanks for your support EzySlips."
"Seriously outstanding app that is backed up by even better customer service. These guys are great. They are patient, thorough, and proactive. And their app is easy to use, fully functional, and makes sites look gorgeous. I highly recommend this app for anyone who wants a standout site with an optimal user experience."
"A fantastic & very simple interface which creates pages that look fantastic on a desktop. However, on mobile, the results just aren't great. Given that such a vast majority of our customers experience our store on mobile I'm afraid we've uninstalled."
Great app. saves lot of time. great user interface. Saves atleast of 10 min on every transaction. Keep up the great work.
"Easy interface...love the drag and drop.  Gives more options than just the stock Shopify Page template.  Also...customer support is the BEST!  If you have any questions, they have an easy click to chat function with quick and fast responses.  Would recommend."
"Easy to assign tracking ID, user friendly interface. Using the same platform from last 2 years and good technical support. The team help us every time and in time response is there, even in the off-working hours also. Thanks for your support EZYSLIPS."
"Used this app to showcase customer UGC. Very useful and beneficial, easy to use!
Would highly recommend this app to people looking for an easy interface."
"Galleries added easily and quickly.  I even made a new product menu listing which was not available to me in my theme.  Interface can seem a bit clunky, but fine when you get used to it.  Overall a good app that has solved a couple of issues for us and was simple to learn.  Recommend."
"This app is easy to use, and flexible enough to use for several purposes throughout your Shopify store. We are using it to display our instagram posts on our homepage, to showcase customers' photos on our product pages, and will soon implement a ""Shoppable Instagram"" page.
Having a centralized interface to manage/update all of these feeds saves a lot of time and frustration.
It is also nice to see that the development team is actively updating/improving the app. I'd highly recommend this app, especially considering the cost and features of their competitors."
"Easy to use interface, excellent support team, stress free mailout application. Great stuff SmartrMail!"
Easy to use and beautiful interface!
I used this app and found it's been the easiest app to to use and it's very clean interface for someone like me who isn't an seo expert and a small business owner start up. Also the team at sherma assisted me with back end issues I had with previous seo apps I had installed.
"Great app. From the outlook this app may not look that appealing to anyone who's looking for visually striking badges, but it does the deed. For badge apps, there're not so many choices out there. This app is just a perfect balance between reasonable price and good features. The interface is great, the support is very good as well, nothing can beat my fellow Vietnamese's support. And that is also something I'm very proud of using."
"Early days are looking good! We particularly like your interface and email editor. Thank you for putting so much thought into user experience.
Your email testing function is really good too."
Fantastic app! Adding reviews is a lot easier..We've experienced an issue with installation and the rescue has been quick and smooth. It looks smart and the interface is also user-friendly with plenty of features. Definitely recommended!
"Toutes les fonctionnalités utiles sont dans cette application. Le support m'a répondu dans la journée et le problème était résolu le lendemain. Super efficace, c'est ce dont on attend d'une application qui traite des dates de réservations pour nos produits ! L'interface est facile et intuitive, et il y a un exemple qui te montre exactement le résultat en temps voulu. Cela m'a permis d'économiser énormément de temps pour obtenir exactement les réglages que je souhaitais. Merci infiniment à la team."
"If I could give this app six stars, I would! Shopify's interface for editing products and uploading sheets is horrible whereas Excelify makes it a breeze to do and massively reduces the chance of unforeseen errors occurring, I only wish I had found it sooner! The fact that you can also include an extra store under your plan is very useful if you are looking to expand. There are a wealth of tutorials and documentation provided by the developers, meaning it's really easy to get started and understand how everything works. This really should be a must-have for any Shopify merchant, thank you and keep up the good work!"
the interface isn't the prettiest but it does its job perfectly. the interface isn't the prettiest but it does its job perfectly.
"Excelify has been a lifesaver for our Shopify store. We use it to schedule daily inventory syncs across our warehouses, update products in bulk, and export information for our bookkeeper. It does an amazing job of extending Shopify's functionality with a simple, easy to use interface. Any time I've had any questions, the Excelify support team has been super quick to get back to me with detailed explanations. I could not recommend this app more!"
"Terrible, I have no idea how to use this!!!!!! And I pretty freakin app savy. But this app has me baffled, I don't have time to deal with the interface.
Tough to figure out. Plus they won't let me submit a 1 star review. Go figure"
Great app! Easy to use very with a very friendly interface.  I  built a beautiful  FAQ with less than 15 minutes.
"The app works like a clock, the interface is ok, and if you have any issues with the excel files, the support team will help you accomplish what you need. We are very satisfied :)"
"I had problems with importing reviews but the team of HelpfulCrowd was very patient answering numbers of my questions and was ready to help and even to change interface a bit just for our website. Yusuf, accept my kind regards thank you for your help, patience and assistance! It is really a pleasure to deal with you )) Many thanks!"
"Nosto has brought instant, measurable value to our store. The recommendations are top notch and allow us to offer them to our customers and site visitors in a robust, rock-solid fashion. We are using the recommendations in our Facebook retargeting as well and have been quite pleased with the performance there too. They make setup a breeze and the user interface is really intuitive. A big win all the way around for us."
"Nosto is a fantastic app! It has helped me significantly increase the revenue of my store and I really am grateful for it's intelligence and easy to use interface. Credit to the team over in London, Rory especially. He has been so helpful whenever I have needed support."
Fontify is making our web build a breeze. Lets us easily try out various custom fonts using the simple interface rather than digging in to code. Jade has been great on support too... ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
really good app. I had an issue with my data tracking and duplicated events on facebook pixel but this solved the issue and helped me get more accurate data. I had a slight issue pop up regarding my pixel but their support was super helpful in finding the issue. Stella was very helpful in putting me through to Huy who helped with my initial problem and the Trong (kaze) went even further buy taking over my screen and interacting with my interface to find the root of the problem. Definitely recommend this app !
It does a great job! The interface isn't always the most intuitive because the labelling isn't clear. But the customer service is prompt and helpful!
Newbie at this! Has a very easy to use interface and the options are amazing! Very versatile app couldn't ask for more!
"I'm literally glad that this app exists! they have the lowest prices, Tons of t-shirt colors, I ordered a sample and the printing quality and colors are very good, I sell on amazon and this company gave me a second chance to lower my prices and beat the competition in the marketplace, the app interface is simple and very easy to use, highly recommended, thank you!!!!!"
"Friendly interface, fast fulfillment, lowest prices in the category. I highly recommend and I look forward to more products to be added to the catalog!"
"UPDATE 02/04/2017
After speaking with customer service on multiple occasions, they went above and beyond to get our situation resolved.  Overall, it did cause us to lose a few days for print production, but it is fixed now and that is what matters.  
For anyone looking for the most versatile product catalog app, this is by far it.  Out of a sea of ""plug and play"" apps, this is the best bet.  Trust us on this one and just download this app if you're really trying to avoid a more comprehensive set of tools like Adobe offers.  For us, we needed something quick and for the most part ZINation's tools provide that.  The new interface (with some additional features) seems promising and we will stick around to see if they follow through with some of those necessary additional features.  
Overall a good app with the potential to be great and customer service that does care about their customers.
Thanks ZINation
ORIGINAL REVIEW 02/03/2017
Extremely upset with this app and company.  We spent approximately 120 man hours building two separate catalogs, exported them via PDF, and sent them to our print press company for hard copy proofs.  Once the proofs arrived, they required a few edits, so we went back into ZINation to make our changes. To our absolute shock, the entire website interface changed and all our HTML and custom CSS changes are gone.  In fact, their is no way to globally edit CSS or HTML anymore.
The new interface may very well work for some users, but why on earth weren't existing users notified of these massive changes that were rolled out?  There is no way to recover all our work from the previous version/interface?  So, not only are we out the subscription fee that we paid (the lesser cost here), we are out the enormous amount of hours we invested in learning to use their tool and hours of heavy editing of the HTML and CSS templates.  
Absolutely the worst experience we have had with any app in Shopify thus far and truly a shame that a good thing could go so bad.
Our advice, invest your time and money in another technology like Adobe and build it yourself.  Don't leave the fate of your hard work in someone else's hands, especially ZINation :("
"This app seems stable, the admin interface is easy to use and responsive, but it falls frustrating short of our requirements because — as others have pointed out — it doesn't offer support for variants. The developer asked me to update my review in light of the fact that they do state in the description that this app doesn't support variants. I've revised my rating to 4 stars as I appreciate how important reviews are for small developers on the app store. But the fact remains; the app doesn't support variants, and the monthly fee is inexplicably high given the very limited feature set, so my honest review remains 3 stars. The developer has however kindly pointed us in the direction of another app which does what we require plus much, much more ... for a price not that dissimilar to this app. In summary: a useful app for basic stores. Not for more demanding power users, despite a price tag which may suggest otherwise! But thank you to Extendons for their support, and honesty in recommending a competing app."
Its very quick and easy to use interface. I have edited price of all products with 3 clicks. Great solution to bulk edit all ur products
"Helps me automate manual shopify tasks such setting discount prices, managing tags, etc. The user interface is sleek and intuitive."
"I did heaps of research on the best post-purchase upsell app – with a view to reducing the number of annoying pop-ups customers get (as we already have a few on our site so didn't want to add more) and good support if there was a problem. Well, the support is FANTASTIC. Shout out to Halyna, who has been super responsive when I had loads of questions when I was setting up my first offers. The plug and play interface is really easy to set up and understand, and the video tutorials embedded in each section of the app are nice and clear. I just set up my thank you page upsell and already got my first order. Very pleased!"
"This app is a no-brainer. Nice interface. Plenty of options. Reasonably priced (not taking a % of sales like others). Alex is always super helpful and replies straight away with any questions. I have zero complaints. If any, I hope they can offer a size upsell for the same product in the near future!"
AWESOME app and customer service! They were a huge help and VERY fast. The app is great for user experience and adding revenue!
"UPDATE: Screwed up my Shopify store big time! They promised free forever if people leave a positive review which I was happy to do when it worked. But out of the blue I go in and I've been cut down to 1 static tab and a message that says I have to pay. So fine, I paid since I thought if it works it is good. Nope, the interface wouldn't let me create text entries at all. I tried custom but first it wasn't let me enter hyperlinks at all and then later it did but they didn't show up on the page. I uninstalled and asked for a refund (here's hoping they do), but now my product descriptions don't show up at all just giving error messages that it can't find the tabs. If the dang thing was reliable as it was before I'd say go for it, but this is now a total nightmare, stay away.
OLD:
The app simply works. I used it to add information to my product descriptions in a more compact presentation. Recommended."
The app has given us a 35-40X ROI month-on-month. This is a must have app if the majority of your traffic comes through Facebook ads. The interface is great and Joe was helpful in providing us support.
Easy to use and great interface! You can select the displayed pages by urls. highly recommended!!!!!
"In the operation, one key synchronous optimization saves time and effort, speeds up the interface promotion, and wins the attention of consumers at the first time, thus increasing the order opportunities."
lousy interface and process to implement - Way too cumbersome to implement if you need multiple pricing per variant . For 4 options and 200 variants with different costs the effort is over 1000 operations - Per Product!
Really great app! No problems at all and the interface was really simple and easy to understand. Customer support was also amazing; super helpful and quick to respond to my concerns. I recommend this app 100%!
"easy to use! highly recommend, no need to worry about hidden agendas. Easy to navigate and no worries when it comes to UI interface. Great Clean Designs."
It’s helped expand most of the options I required. Interface is relatively straightforward once you familiarise with the difference in options and option sets. Customer service is helpful and prompt to assist.
"Great app, with a totally fuss-free setup and interface. If you're particular about placement and appearance, hop on a call with the LogBase team, excellent service as usual, and special shout-out to Sree, who patiently made all the adjustments I requested for."
Installed it it worked right away! I wanted to customise the interface a bit and connected with a customer service rep who immediately connected me with a developer named Sree who was able to customise it exactly the way I wanted. 5+ stars!!!
"This form builder has the best user interface, it’s user-friendly, very intuitive and always reliable. The system has never failed us, it's always up and running, and it looks great on our site! This allows us to create almost any kind of online form we want in just a fraction of the time from what it used to take for programming each form. Using this form builder, we spare a lot of time and therefore money. :)"
"Unfortunately my experience is lack luster from a number of issues stemming from the poorly designed app interface which doesn't allow you to customize the position of your uploads on your product. But after placing 2 failed orders it was clear that WC fulfillment is not only unreliable but they also have poor ethics. My first customers order was never received by the customer and that issue was never address by wcfulfillment. My second order was never even processed. After a week waiting I requested to cancel the order, to my surprise I was told I would have to wait 24-48hrs to cancel the order that could be shipped anytime between that same time frame. forcing me to keep an order I no longer waited. On top of that there is no other form of customer service or contact beside online chatting, which im sure is probably a 3rd party."
"Fantastic app, that does what it is suppose to. Easy to use interface with some great features built in. What's also great is the customer support! Michael was very helpful and patient with my questions and requests. Would definitely recommend! --------
Update: Customer support is still flawfless, happy to still be using this app with the support team behind it!"
Very easy to use and good interface!
"I love the interface and ease of use of the app. I made my first 10 sales after switching over to WC. Nate has great advice and gives every single resource you could possibly need to get started. The other gurus just don't compare in my opinion, I highly recommend WC, and I look forward to scaling to the moon with everything there is to offer here."
"Great Customer Support. The user experience is just great, they design it to feel like it's one of shopify pages."
"I started working with HTML back in 1994 when things were all so new and primitive - I still have my Quarterdeck Webauthor V1.0 floppy disk! I handcoded really complex stuff and used backend databases to add real-time dynamic content capability. Since then, I've played with many template-based authoring products which have removed the need for so much handcoding drudgery and minimised human coding errors. By and large, you can now just really focus on creating great content and dragging and dropping structural components and styling really quickly. I first trialled GEM pages about six months ago and have since totally adopted it as my primary development tool. I still prefer to build my own layouts and I've found the range of GEM Page components to be very comprehensive and functionally spot-on. I also love the ease with which I can easily create responsive mobile and multi-device interfaces. The working interface is very simple and nicely intuitive. It's made my productivity rate really good. Support is really quick and excellent too. The only thing I'd like to have added ASAP is backwards navigation from product displays to collections to make it easy for users to navigate within pages! (Please!) :) xx"
"Simple, reliable, and by far the most user-friendly interface we have yet to use. We will never choose another page builder! and Kenny form support is great!"
"So far so good! I just downloaded the app. The only reason why I am not giving it a 5 star is that I just started using it. From what I can experience now, I can tell you that it has a clear interface and I love the look of it. It is so nice. Plus customer service chat is quick and responsive,"
Installed the app today - nice interface. Support and developers were really efficient. Thank you for your assistance!
Super simple to use. Easy interface with results that can impact our sales. Another form to get customers back into our store after leaving.
As soon as i uploaded the app it was super easy to use and learn. I enjoyed the simplicity of the interface and how easy it was to input in my store. My experience with free trust badge was good.  I love it! Highly recommend. Thank you!
"Alex and Max has done a really tremendous job to customize my website wishlist according to my needs. 
I happened to chance upon their Wishlist King app as I was on the lookout for better Wishlist apps. I've previously tried and installed apps from other companies and felt that despite the companies offering me a cheaper monthly fee than Wishlist King, they have very limited features, poor customization services and mediocre customer service. It really wasn't worth paying for if the app teams will not put the extra effort to keep up with what customers are actually looking for.
But this Wishlist app is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G ! You can read about the features that they offer on the description such as sharing buttons, free installation and customization, no delays, full support and proper analytics, and they are indeed facts. Wishlist King has really live up to its name as you can really trust them to provide these impressive features to your website.
However, what I really love the most about this Wishlist app is:
- They're the only wishlist app in the market (which I am aware of) that allows your customers choose their variables in the wishlist page, depending on what variants you have created (eg blue in the color variant, size L in the size variant, iphone 7 in the phone model type). Check out the demos and you'll understand more. 
- The app team themselves - There's so many words to describe them: Cooperative, understanding, hardworking, meticulous and professional in their field. There were occasions when the team and I have a miscommunication but they're always taking the extra step to clarify any problems and taking the utmost effort to accommodate to your needs. They're also highly skilled and experienced, they've managed to integrate my ajax feature with the add to cart button in my wishlist page. If you have doubts such as user experience (UX) , they can also provide really good advice if you really need it.
- App team provides top notch customer service. They're really quick to respond to your emails, showing that they can be relied on when you need them to sort out matters at a short period of time.
You will not be disappointed with the Wishlist King app and the team behind it. Especially to Alex and Max, thank you so much for your help, you guys are in my books 10/10!"
"great user interface, easy to use, you can choose any badges. I would recommend this app to anyone that is just started to use shopify."
This app is awesome! It has a great interface and setup is easy. All my questions were answered promptly by Pauline and I highly recommend using this app.
"J'ai utilisé Printful parce qu'il propose des articles écoresponsables, venant d'Europe et que l'app est utilisable en Fr avec devise en €.
Le choix des articles est diversifié, la plateforme est claire et on est très bien accompagnés par les différents modules, tutos, vidéos, etc.
J'apprécie particulièrement l'interface avec les défis, très malin, il est facile de se faire prendre ""au jeu""."
"We just started using this app to manage our gift cards and loyalty program. The gift card setup is easy and quick, customers appreciate having a choice of gift cards designs and sending them directly to the recipient immediately or scheduling for later. The loyalty program took a bit more effort for us to grasp and implement because we migrated from a points system and Rise loyalty program works on store credits. The most amazing feature of this app is their excellent customer support - we've had multiple questions during migration and setup that were answered quickly and helped us understand the system. The support team is very helpful and patient with questions :-) Our Rise loyalty program will go live in a few days and I hope our customers will appreciate the simplicity and better user experience than the points collecting & redeeming option."
"I love this app!! The best part of it is that its FREE!! The free version includes so many features like analytics, charts, countdown timer, etc that with other apps you would have to spend $ for. I'm super impressed by the interface too, it's very intuitive and easy to work around, I'm able to set up a nice pop up for my store in just 5 minutes! Since installing, I've been having a lot more subscriptions that I can't wait to use to help me with my advertising. The analytics portion of it is great too. Would recommend!"
Great App. Very easy to use and user friendly interface. Would be great if it can add labels on the collection.
"UPDATE: I have updated my review to 2 stars for management reaching out to me concerning these issues. However, outside of the shipping situation, all of my concerns are valid and are features that they are looking into not the features they currently have. A promise is not going to change my mind today. Plus, I was asked to change my review which also has put a bad taste in my mouth since my biggest issues are not being resolved yet. I'm not going to rate something 5 stars if that wasn't my experience and the things I need are not available to me today. Thank you Shopify for the professional email regarding my concerns but I'm not updating my review to 5 stars. You have a 4.3 rating so my 1% negative rating that is genuine and authentic even by your standards per our email should not deter you from striving to be a better company or steer others away from continuing business with you. If in the future these changes are met then I will update my review to a higher star value. Thanks. This app lacks an intuitive interface. Setting up shipping was very complicated and because there are different print providers it gets a little tricky if your order is rerouted. I am currently switching my shirts from Printify to another POD since my selected printer no longer prints with Printify. It is a headache if your printer you select no longer is an option. Now I have to roll the dice on another printer that I am not familiar with. They also do not have a wide variety of printers that print labels or sleeves anymore which is a problem as many of my designs print sleeves and labels. The only printer that prints on a bella + canvas labels and sleeves aren't in the U.S, which can increase your shipping rates drastically. Also, there aren't any reviews on the site whatsoever which makes me even more nervous to choose a new print provider. You have to do your own research on these printers as well as on the products themselves. If you could see what other sellers think it would make things a little less of a gamble on products and printing. There is a ranking but it says it is based on user reviews that I have no idea how to see these reviews since they are not on the website. Felt like a waste to even start selling with Printify. Help has gotten better though."
"Been using Printify for many months. We are very happy with the app. Their service for any kind of issues is excellent.
Would love to see more print providers offering neck label prints.
Interface is excellent as well, although we would love to see better customization features. Their upload / save as draft feature is already great for customization (since we send our client a proof and might need to come back to make changes), but being able to link our manual orders to Shopify Delivered / Fulfilled Tags would be very useful, as currently we send out review requests entirely manually due to this, which is very time consuming.
Looking forward to continue using Printify and seeing how they improve the platform, hopefully we can add that fifth star soon :)"
So far so good! reviews are coming in - Positive and negative for us to help create a better user experience and provide a better product.
"The prints are a good quality. They have a clean, user-friendly interface. Efficient responses via the agents. Overall, very pleased. Only thing I'm really waiting for is the option for custom labels via US print providers."
"This app is so easy to use! The product assortment is great and the user experience is smooth. I'm really happy with product set up, viewing the product with the choice of white backgrounds or in an environment to show scale, and specs for uploading files is super clear."
"Great app, easy to use, very straight forward, and even more importantly great Customer Service. A few features that I hope to see added in the future, but very serviceable, and overall great. Read more if you'd like to see a full list of our pro's and cons. 
Pro's
-------------
Great Customer Service
Excellent Interface
Well Written Code - Fast, Reliable, No Bloat
Integrations with Shopify for Customer Account Creation
Simple Setup
Good Integrations with 3rd Party Analytics and Marketing
Dev Friendly, lots of options for adding identifiers for personal/team web design, if you know how to do it. (Please only do so if you know what you're doing)
Cons
-------------
Missing some integrations that other apps have--adding customer notes for example. 
Improperly set up additions (re:Google Analytics) can nullify a form from being used at all, only solution is to delete and re-make or reach out to support to have them remove the messed up addition. 
Would like to see more options for Form Customization. These are basic in design so they should fit most sites, but additional customization options would be helpful for smaller stores without WebDev knowledge, or a Dev Team. 
I would definitely recommend it at this price point, and want to point out that for $10 a month, you get a well designed, and streamlined platform, with quick, and very helpful Customer Service. I had complex questions, and they gave me answers quickly, accurately, and provided enough information to stop any follow-up questions I had before I'd asked them. 
5/5 Stars."
This is a must have app for all stores. Has helped me improve my customer journey. Simple and effective user interface allows you too see the recordings easily. Recordings can also be viewed on your phone. Will save you if you missed a bug during store set up!
It's really a must have for an e-commerce store! Very useful to understand the customer behavior and can help if you have any problem on your website that you can't see. I 100% recommend it ! The only thing i have to say is in my opinion the interface of the application could be better but still a really great app!
"I am new to print-on-demand, but I have checked a few other companies before I started. I must say I am very impressed by how Printify operates. The user interface for me as a designer is INCREDIBLE. Really easy to learn and operate. Very clean, intuitive, no issues using it! I wish everything in life would be and work like that!"
"really astonishing what this app is able to do. from what i have seen now, it might be very useful for the user experience and customer journey research. will try more and more. very quick user support!"
I highly recommend Gooten's customer service - received prompt response to design questions with direct information!  The app interface is clean and simple to use.  It also allows for easy design customization.
"Okay so WOW. I really really enjoy the functionality of this gamified wheel, I've recommended it to colleagues, friends who run stores, and even my own clients... It's almost shocking how efficiently this app works, and with the new added features, it's only not increasing conversions on friends shops, but my own has doubled in conversions. This app truly is a piece of art. I can tell you, the price of the app is basically paid off within the first week of use. I am truly shocked. It doesn't fail on any niche, it has multiple holiday themes, dynamic coupons so you don't ever have to make them, and overall the visual appeal plus effect on speed ( compared to the other gamified wheel, raffle, scratch off, etc apps ) it doesn't even slow down your store. I have 5 apps on this store, it's new, and without fail Wheelio has been worth every penny. I will always keep this app, i've tried the others, and I couldn't understand why any brand would even want to use them, please do yourself a huge service; and your wallet lol. Try Wheelio, you literally will make your money back in the trial period, if not half of it... it's a major player... I know i'll never switch. Amazing. Seriously. Speechless. The support is nice, functionality, how easy it is to run split tests, or even set up a simple 1 time wheel. The user interface is even pretty, I mean this app hit every target! Customer for life here, and I love Shopify, I think a store owner literally only needs Wheelio, a good theme, and the best ecommerce paltform imo after years .. Shopify obviously haha.. and you've got a ROI that will be profitable. THANK YOU for this piece of art! I really advise anyone to pause any other wheel or raffle or whatever, try Wheelio .. it's a game changer. Also it is an original, so you know what they say, "" why try the rest when you've got the best! "" Wheelio + Shopify = $$$$$$$$$$"
"I tried to use them for my mugs because the price was so low. But I always order samples first and time and time again , the samples were bad. I settle on using them for my greeting cards The interface to add products ( at least for Greeting cards ) have always been clunky and non-intuitive. The shipping feels extremely high. I hope they keep improving."
Great and easy to use app! The user interface is easy to understand and the support team is really helpful.
"stat interface not great, minimal ability to customize.  Seems like there are alot of improvements that could make it so much better and more effective.
Still does seem to help drive list building and conversions."
"Working with Gooten has been great since the beginning of our connection.  They were so helpful to all of our needs, big and small.  Very responsive customer service team as well!  A great variety of products to choose from, and they have welcomed our suggestions as well.  Love their customer interface, very user friendly.  Overall, great company to work with!"
It’s is cost efficient the customer service is great especially as a store you always want to communicate with your manufacturers. They have high variety of products to print on and the interface is very user friendly. I have been using them for 4-5months now and I highly recommend these underdogs
"We are using this app for Christmas sales till now. However, this is an horrible experience.
We got sooooo many negative reviews of user experience on mobile and tablet: iPhone, Android phone, iPad. Our customer support team handle 10+ more complaints every single days. I have many evidences to approve my review. 
Of course we asked for their support team to fix it, but they just got back and said they can't find any issue on the mobile version.
I'm going to ask for refund."
Great onsite search tool. Interface is so easy to navigate around and quick to implement changes. Susmit and Max have been great with onboarding and have weekly working calls to assist.
"So far, excellent product and easy to work with for rectangular items such as tea towels and shower curtains. Haven't tried much else yet. My only complaint is the cost of shipping to Canada. I am not sure I will be able to use for much due to that reason. Shipping three items to Canada $50 and for items that are not that expensive it is hard to bury that cost in the price of the item.
And I do like the interface! Very clean and easy, so far!!!"
Really easy and simple to setup. Page loads much faster than it did before. Doesn't make any difference to Google page speed but user experience much better.
Very good interface. Very good and imediate support. I would prefer this app to give also low stock alerts.
The best upsell app here on the shopify app store. Super easy to set up. Extremely great and effective user experience & the support is amazing!
Great app worked for me and still using it. Though users interface needs to improve to meet up with the sleek functionality it provides.
"A beautiful interface, easy to integrate and use. We have already received compliments from our customers. Their support team is great to deal with, efficient and quick to help/respond. I've had a couple of requests that I thought was out of scope, but they were able to assist. It's been a pleasure dealing with them. Highly recommend."
"The app is very easy and straight forward and a simple/easy-to-use interface. I even requested a ""print"" icon for easy printing on orders, and they quickly put one together for me! Thanks so much!"
Love this App. Minifier is a must have to optimize your store images for faster loading and better user experience for your customers. Best of all you pay only for images you wish to optimize with no monthly fees. Highly recommend this App for anyone looking to speed up their website and pages load time.
"Great experience, great support, the app is great and very useful for the the users.
The interface is beautiful. Thank you"
"GiftShip app provided the features we needed: multi-address shipping, gift messages, delivery date picker etc. It has plenty of options to configure the look and feel of the cart and user experience. The best part is their support! Kevin promptly helped us with the tweaks and mods we asked for. Highly recommended!"
"I installed this app while developing the store. This customer account interface is exactly what we hoped for. Very neat and clean, super easy to use. Now since our store is live, I'm eager to hear feedback from our customers."
"Great app with very user friendly interface. It is not easy to make custom changes from your own css but the support team are lightening fast at replying and implementing changes. Brilliant app, brilliant customer service."
This app is great and the interface is simple to use.  It really helps you with your price adjustments.
Langify is very good for translate your shop and have a great and very fast support. Langify is too good customizable. The interface is clear and intuitive.
"I've just started using this app to recoup sales lost when products are out of stock. It was so easy to install with a simple to use interface, and the support I received (when it clashed slightly with another app I use) was totally above and beyond what I expected! Thank you so much."
"Frist of all - does exactly as I expect it to with a clean and direct user interface. I had an installation issue and I contacted support and within an hour the problem was solved with great communication from the only developer, Kartik. Great experience!"
I installed app. Interface was simple enough to use. Took a while for all campaigns to start. Saw an increase in traffic but no sales. Decided to uninstall after $200 Fb bill. Possibly my site but I prefer to have more control over what I am doing. Adscale wanted a review the day it was installed....lol. Wait and see if it delivers and then request a review. Hope others have a better result.
"Works perfectly with both FBA and FBM inventory. Interface is very easy to use, and includes a drop down status window that shows you the import/export progress. On top of that, the support is excellent - all of my emails were answered with 1hr. We used the 3,000 sku plan - it took about 30mins to import from Amazon, and 1hr to push into Shopify - both with a click of a button. We selected this app since it also imported images from our Amazon listings - it would have taken us weeks to upload pictures to Shopify, but ByteStand did it automatically. Well worth the initial fee, and the monthly fee is also very reasonable."
we are working with them since last 4 months and we have seen a constant rise in revenues from there advertising and we would highly recommend them. The team is always available to help us out so its a good experiance so far. Its worth the money you spend so no harm giving it a shot.  What would make this app more usefull is customization on the ad interface and the team has assured that they are working on it. so its only gona get better.
"It does exactly what it says it's going to do. Interface is extensive, lots of (useful) bells and switches. manual entering could be better, but import works like a charm."
Easy to use app. The interface is simple yet very effective. No need to recommend you know already what McAfee does! Trust app at its finest! Happy to use it!
"I used this app to add a 'pre-order' feature as an option for my customers, and it also has a discount feature integrated that you can add for your customers who actually pre-order the product. I love how easy it was to use. It is a very intuitive app, that is also free for the first 15 products I believe. I highly recommend this app. I also love that their interface design completely blended with mine and one cannot tell that I am using an outside app."
"Great interface, easy to setup, highly recommend this app!"
The application is easy to use. It is very easy to set up cross sells among products. Back end functionality provides an excellent user experience. The Cross Sell team installed the application free of charge which helped me to get set up asap. I would highly recommend Cross Sell.
"Very clean user interface and very easy to use with video tutorials.
I'm using it to collect emails and offer coupons. Thank you."
I've been searching for an app that would help clean up the user experience when navigating through different variants to only show images for that particular variant and this product works PERFECTLY! I even ran into an issue with my particular theme and the way it was loading some images and the support team fixed it within a day. I cannot say enough about the product and the people behind this app.
"Good interface from Shopify to Etsy.
Able to sync everything. And also got very good support when I had questions and issues to solve."
"Super easy to set up, very straight forward user-friendly interface. 
Customer support is on point - super helpful staff!"
"Great experience with the Cross Sell app. Already seeing results. Very easy install and user experience. The Cross Sell support team is very responsive and did some customization with a very quick turn around. Must-have app, would highly recommend!"
The support given so far is excellent. The app can be better in terms of features and user experience. Look forward to the upgraded and improved version.
"If you are looking for a cheap out-of-the-box mobile app solution, this one is by far the best. We started with a different app, but found its limited features, iOS only option, and non SDK function just didn't make having an app worthwhile. In fact, we just got negative feedback from app users saying ""why bother?"" And while i would be nice to afford a custom purpose-built app, we couldn't justify the spend.
Enter Plobal Apps, offering both Android + iPhone (we are still hoping iPad will be added soon), SDK checkout for in-app purchases, a nice, simple ""less is more"" product and category display which really suits our store graphics, and after sales service that is literally second to none.
To say Plobal have gone to extreme lengths to give us the best possible mobile app is an understatement. They have responded quickly, and positively to every single request we have made, and our store interface is not an easy one. They have managed to incorporate spring loaded tabs, variant options, google fonts, and more.
Khadija, you are worth every dollar Plobal is paying you. Nothing has phased her, and no request or enquiry has gone unanswered for more than an hour or so. And that is taking into account vast global time differences for us. She is bright, cheery, knowledgable, and genuinely wants your app to be a huge success.
The cost of many Shopify-compatible apps is another issue. I cannot understand the extremely high price demanded by so many apps – our monthly app bill is staggering – and something we regularly monitor and discuss. Plobal Apps is not cheap, and the jury is still out as to whether the cost is actually recovered in sales, or its just a cool way for millennials to shop. But any other mobile app is also going to cost the same, or more, and a custom-built app, well that's just another league.
So in all, I would highly recommend Plobal Apps as the best out-of-the-box mobile app for Shopify by a long way. I am very happy to give it 5 stars."
"Instant Search works right out of the box.
It's very easy to install and gives excellent results as you type.
I like that you can also add some specific keywords to show specific products.
What I like less is their interface.
It's ugly and I wish they would use Shopify's framework to make a more user friendly layout.
It really doesn't want to go in and customize all of your options.
Another bummer is that the lower plan only allows you to see the last 30 days of stats.
Knowing what keywords were the most searched in the last year or last 6 months would be great... but I'm not going to pay an extra 60$+ per month for that option.
Overall, it does what it says and it does it well.
My visitors use it more than I though."
"This company has exceeded my expectations since day one! Since the very first day I came across this app in the App Store! Having an app can be intimidating! The research can time consuming and draining. The team over at Plobal Tech continue to leave me speechless each day with their exceptional on the spot customer service! I can say honestly say the team at Plobal Tech handle their customers with grace! I am more than positive that my sales are about to increase at least 75% because of this app. The admin interface is super easy to use!!! And if you still don't understand, the team is there to make sure you overstand. My success is you all's success! Thank you Plobal, Ali and Khadija for a seamless teamwork experience! Much success to you!!!"
"Still learning, and there were some issues with getting things to connect properly, but overall this has been great so far compared to the other app that I used. This app has a great interface, easy to use. Customer service always has someone there to help me! This has increased my sales and time by allowing me to sell on shopify and etsy! Must have!"
"To all who wants to starts a shopify store.
This a great platform to convert your store to a app platform. The interface is definitely very attractive and ridiculously fast. I have the SDK version which also has native login. I would suggest you to go for the SDK version because the extra investment is worth the price.
Now, let me share my experience from online store to mobile app platform.
1. 70% From mobile app
2. 22% From online store
3. 18% Over Phone (Draft Orders)
This stats is enough to decide what you want. Please note if you have more then 60% visitors from mobile, this is a must have feature. 
Instread of investing more on a native app at startup. Try to exatualy know your market and gain customers from platform like this. 
Now, about the suppport this team provides.
1. 24/7 dedicated service team for you round the clock.
2. No matter what ever problem you face, this team makes sure you get out of it. 
3.  They make sure you are a valued customer even after or before subscription. 
I will end up saying, you must try this app, I am sure you will definetly stick to it. 
The push Notification and advance analytical feature will definetly help you bring more sale. This is more a growth platform then a app platform. Happy Selling. 
Team Baritoz"
"I highly recommend the Plobal App team. I did research about the mobile app intagrated with shopify and i found the app with well user experience and functionality.
Their support is fantastic, the team reply all my messages in 1 hours!
Thanks Plobal apps and i waiting your next update."
Amazing customer service! Super easy app to use. Great team to work with and many easy adjustments for store owners to customize. The only real choice for a pop-up as the interface is easy to use. Highly recommended.
"Amazing and helpful staff and such a great user experience !Everything is working well , i really loved this app"
Brilliant!!!! Easy to use. Super user friendly interface. Setup and tested in under a hour. I have been looking for something just like this for a long time!! So glad I found this app. Very happy with the results.  Check out mine in action http://crazyhorseclothing.com.au/
Easy to use app. The interface is simple yet very effective. It fits on any device! Definitely a recommended app! Happy to use it!
"From the beginning I was really impressed with the layout of Buddha Mega Menu, the layout and easy to user friendly interface, made it effortless to integrate into my store. 
I had a couple of teething problems at the beginning, however, when I contacted support, they provided me with one of the most incredible customer service experiences I've ever had. 
Especially Roxana, who was extremely attentive, patient, and kept on top of my query, and followed up on promises in a timely manner.
Very impressed, and cannot wait to use this app more! 
Highly recommend"
"Highly recommend this application. Its ability to heighten user experience is the reason why I downloaded it. If you have a large catalog of products or services, it's important to have everything visually digestible. Buddha Mega Menu does a great job at that."
This app is absolutely amazing. The interface is extremely easy to use. I have used other apps and the Buddha Mega Menu allows me to design those beautiful menus that you see on all the top fashion retail stores. I had an issue installing the menu and Roxana was quick and efficient in showing me what the issue was and getting the issue fixed by their developer. I am very happy!
"It's okay. Does what it says it'll do, but the interface is clunky and awkward, and it's missing a lot of the functions that some of its competitors have. A solid entry in the category for sure, but not the best anymore."
"Nice interface and easy to use. One great point for you. Their program is really make sense in redeem part becos they are gen a coupon code for use, it will not affect your main system actually. Really appreciate that fast response and great support compare with some loyalty app even I paid. A little bit crazy and surprise that is FREE here."
"This is a great app. It helped organize my store to allow customers to quickly see the inventory. I have limited website construction experience, but Buddha Mega Menu has a very intuitive user interface. The instruction videos were helpful also. 
I can't speak for the whole app (since I only used the 'tree' option), but the one thing I would have appreciated is having a fourth level for the tree. But it's still great as is."
"Very buggy, feels more like the thing was hacked together than what I would expect from an app. We stupidly paid for about $1000 in dollars in add ons, most of which seem like they should just be part of any good wholesale app right out of the box. Setup took weeks and we were left with a very unusable ""app"".
•Non-wholesale customers were seeing flashes of wholesale pricing. We received numerous emails from customers stating that the ""sale"" prices were not there when they went to check out.
•Inventory control is a complete disaster. From the moment you decide to use the app all inventory control has to be done through the app interface. This becomes quite annoying for a number of reasons. Under the normal Shopify product section is makes copies of variants for each wholesale category that it belongs to. For example a product called Blue Socks would end up having up to 4 variants. Blue Sock, Blue Sock (sw), Blue Sock (lw) and so on. Those wholesale pricing variants show up in Shopify POS and make it extremely annoying to use reports and adjust inventory levels.
•The app administration section where you adjust pricing, change inventory and administer wholesale customers is very obnoxious and has the look of a “lite” version of an app that cost $1000 plus a monthly fee. It has never ending scrolling banners for MicroApps other apps. For the love of God please quit shoving moon mail down my throat!
•The way in which you set the minimums definitely doesn’t feel like an “app”. To make the minimum of “Blue Socks” 5 you have to go into the product page in Shopify and create a tag that says “ws-min:6”. This is problematic for us because we like having our tags visible on our product pages so that customers can click on them and see products listed with those same tags.
•Very little is actually user adjustable in this app. If you want to adjust and tinker with your shipping methods over time to make sure it’s perfect you have to contact support so they can go in and change it. The custom checkout terms like COD, Net 30, Net 90 etc… have to be changed by Microapps support as well. 
•Some of the customizations just seem a bit ridiculous that they would be considered “customizations” in the first place. Most of them seem like features that would be required of an app that claims to be a wholesale app. Such as $71.99 to show the MSRP next to the wholesale price, $155.99 for product minimums and the one that really hurts me now that I paid for it and am no longer using the system, $623.99 for a “custom” wholesaler checkout experience. 
•Wholesale customers were taking the time to get to checkout and having the order page to just fail to submit. 
We are cutting our losses and walking away from this.
Somehow my 1 star review keeps being changed to 5 star. Super sketchy company here."
"I'm happy with this service. A GUI interface to select products from feeds will be appreciated. A lot job saved with this app. i hope you will update with new options soon.
The customer service is very professional and available to fix my issues.
Very Thankyou"
Realy  Good Addon and Perfect Live Support I like it.  The interface is also very handy. i haven't seen better.
Great app.  Super easy to set up and link to as a page instead of a pop out but also has option for pop out button that works well on computers and ok on my mobile (android).  Simple & clean interface with options to customize the form and to put html before and after form page.
"I *never* write reviews to anything I buy, but I had to for this service. I've tried literally 10 different apps until I found this one. The interface looks a bit old but it's the best data export I've found yet. Super versatile and a google sheets integration, and a very low cost. Most importantly - the data is super accurate and reflective. Some other apps I tried gave me conflicting data, but this one is right on the money every time. This gives me a sense of confidence when making my analysis, and it's so user-friendly that I already have around 10 different automation. The customer support is INSTANT, which surprised me. They answer within seconds when using live chat, which is the fastest I've ever seen. Even Amazon has a long funnel and a minute of waiting time before getting to a representative in their live chats. Like I said- I never write reviews. I hope this convinced at least one person to try this app out because I promise you will not regret it."
"We have used this app for a long time and It does its job in a great way.
The interface is easy to use. Kind of an all-in-one tool for overall site optimization.
The support team is great and quick to respond to requests and any Help."
"The interface is very easy to use. The customer service is superb. I contacted them several times for help, they responded each time promptly. Special thanks to Guillaume - very helpful and patient in assisting me to find solutions. He sets a high bar for customer service!"
I used this app to translate my shopify site from Dutch to English. The interface automatically translates into English and allows me and other assigned to my organisation to review the language and make corrections where necesssary. Most parts of the website can be translated including widgets and hidden text within other apps (like the currency convertor). Instances that are problemtic are followed up by a swift technical reponse from the support team. I definately would recommend this app to other shopify users and I plan to translate into other languages like German. The only snag with the service is the payment option. I don't seem to be able to pay by Paypal or other than creditcard.
"Truly amazing... here's why.
This app is what the Shopify Products page should have been! Allows you to ACTUALLY use the 'does not contain' and other search modifiers, unlike Shopify's absolutely garbage interface. This is also much faster, shows you a preview before you run jobs and lets you undo edits. It's literally brilliant.
Worth every single penny. Highly recommended."
I am a gym owner and I use this app to design and sell customized clothing to my members.  The format and user friendly interface makes it very easy to give my members lost of different options of colors and styles of clothing so that there is something for everyone.   Apliiq is a fantastic tool to build your brand
The interface is pretty straightforward. I ran into a snag with getting my site's fonts to show up correctly and Colby helped me get it all sorted out. It's great knowing that their customer service is so responsive and supportive.
Very user friendly! I used the app to help my only store and have been very impressed on the user interface and step by step guides. Can highly recommend.
Really amazing app and Fantastic customer support! well thought-out app user interface and very helpful automations. Thank you!
"The best app and customer service. Simple to use, clean interface and the customer service is brilliant (an actual lesson in how to interact with customers1). I really love how they listen to what we are trying to achieve and proactively come up with solutions on how to tailor their app to work for our needs. Thanks team"
"A ""must-have"" app for all big catalogue merchants.
We have 20,000+ SKUs and this app helps us create beautiful FB ads in seconds.
On top of that, the team at Socioh helped us in making sure all the complex settings in FB interface were dialed in. 
Super happy. Highly recommended"
"Excellent app, and outstanding service. – This is Luis from the IT/Websites area of CanvasLab.com, we were looking for several alternatives to our current set of apps, just in case some of them became unavailable, suffered of irreversible changes that affected in any negative way our User Interface or Customer Experience or in case some major disaster appeared in the horizon. – Gladly, we not only found a great backup app, but an extremely serious alternative to replace the whole infrastructure that enables the sale of our entire customizable items' stock. – Although the app is a very strong alternative on its own as an out of the box solution to the most robust customization apps that are available on Shopify, the best part was to find a willing development team that helped to create and integrate a unique approach based on several guidelines of the Marketing and Operations departments of our business. – If you don't find something available on the app, ask about it, request a quote, sit back and enjoy the perks of a top quality service. - The best experience I've ever had regarding Shopify Apps."
"Very very cool tool!  I signed up when the app was just leaving beta and I wanted to use it during our Black Friday and Cyber Monday sale.  It's now December 1st and I am very impressed!
It works like many of the other sales apps, picking the products, selecting the days, setting discount, etc.  It then allows you to create a “marketing plan” based on the social platforms you connect to and the number of posts you want to publish each day. (ex. Friday: Twitter 5posts, Facebook 2posts, Instagram 3posts, etc)  It then pulls your product images from Shopify and automatically generates some well designed ""generic posts"" for each day of your sale.  All the images and text can be edited as well.  You'll need to do some small adjustments on the images and customize the text, but the app makes it 100 times easier than creating each post from scratch. 
What I really like about the app is the “pre-settings” are smart and designed to get the most out of your sale. For example, I might not have posted seven tweets on black Friday. (I'm not a tweeter) But because the app suggested seven nice images for me to post, I came up with seven different things to tweet about.  Another example is how nice the ""generic designs"" are. All of them work fundamentally well for attracting customers.  Big bold font, images arranged with a good flow, little gets cropped or cut off when published.  It leaves you to choose the design that works best for your brand's style and not worry about which designs work functionally better than another.  You end up with a ton of options which leaves little need for adjustment.
If you use my example above, “Friday: Twitter 5posts, Facebook 2posts, Instagram 3posts, etc” you would need 70 posts during a one week sale.  This app allows you to organize a large amount of social content and holds you to your marketing goals.
As you can tell, I really like this app and the company behind it.  Being that it's so new, I have found a few bugs which they were able to fix in an incredibly short amount of time. Which leads me to the best feature of this app, the chat window at the bottom of the interface. You actually get to talk to a real person who can fix problems in a few hours. (during business hours)  They're excited to help, want to hear your feedback and are looking for suggestions. You can really tell they are proud of their product and want to make it the best it can be. Which is why I went out of my way to write such a long review.  : )
So check it out!  I think you’ll be impressed!"
"I was looking at some different back in stock apps and this one was last on my list because of the price. Although, the massive amount of 5 star reviews compared to the other apps was note worthy. After trying some of the other apps and finding them to be dysfunctional with slow customer support and unsavory-looking email notifications, I found myself installing Back in Stock by Back in Stock. I can see why they have so many 5 Star reviews. The user interface is simple, easy to understand and use. The email notifications are prompt, well designed and customizable. I had an issue with the ""add to cart"" button on my product pages and after reaching out to support, they quickly responded (turns out it was not related to the app at all). I then learned they could do away with the floating tab and add an ""email me when available"" button, instead, which was preferable and awesome! Really love this app :)"
"Fantastic must have app for every Shopify store. One of the rare times you install an app and it just does it's job with zero issues. User friendly interface, excellent pricing and not that you'll be needing it but if you do have questions the support is A+. I usually don't write reviews but these guys deserve it."
"Truly phenomenal customer support. The interface is intelligently designed, and when our team ran into a road block, I emailed customer support. They were in touch within minutes and were immediately helpful."
Excellent Application I really appreciate the user friendly interface extensive details and information gathering process.
"The app is perfect for my needs, simple and lightweight.
The support is also amazing, would highly recommend for any website that wants simple upload interface."
"Outstanding design. Easy to understand user interface. Uploads are very fast making our site comparable to our competition and that makes us very, very happy. And customizable - not just in the supplied functions and fields, but thru easy to understand classes and id’s. So easy, in fact, that we had the entire app, system, and complete stylings ready for over 30 products and launched within 2 business days. We tried another uploader and though it was similar in functionality, or so it seemed, it was limited in giving us the ability to customize it to our shop and for our uses. And perhaps reiterating what many other colleagues here have said the customer service is outstanding - faster, better, and more communicative than other apps we use - and we use a lot of them. Yongyi in tech support was on spot with every question we asked, and certainly kept us up-to-date so we were never left wondering what our status was. Highly recommended for Functionality, Support, Customization, and all around General User Experience. Five Star App!!!!!!!!!"
"This app is simple, easy to use. Great for users that are not technical (code). Uses a drag and drop interface that didn't take long to get used to. Granted, it has its limitations but for most users, I guess it would more than suffice their need. Not to mention, support have been absolutely brilliant. Toby have been patient and excellent throughout. So even if you run into any issues, you can be sure he is on hand to help.
Lastly, thought I'd help those who are on the fence on this. This app would be perfect for those who wants to use a theme and wants to make some changes to certain pages. E.g. banners, text etc. (I create a number of my pages using this app)"
"All around 5 stars! As a business owner I am concerned about customer experience, so my site has to reflect our brand and our message, and high level user experience. Hypervisual is an awesome app, their tech team and customer service blows away their competition. Response time is excellent and they are always going above and beyond to assure that our business needs are met. I highly recommend Hypervisual!"
"We were looking for a solid, easy to use menu app to expand our linear navigation into a megamenu.
The interface on this app is so straightforward - and lends itself really well to changing navigations from desktop to mobile.
Can't say much else. Definitely a great solution!"
"Great interface, easily understood for even a newbie to eCommerce. just follow their lead to the next step and you would have build up your marketing funnel! Couldn't ask for more for someone who are overwhelmed by what others been telling you in their ""guru"" forum."
"Its one of the most useful apps on Shopify. It automatically creates GST invoices for all orders, its very straightforward with a clean interface. The support is just excellent, never come across such great support from any of the other apps I use. They will fix every issue for you! 5 stars to this App!"
"Amazing app + support. Nice interface & features, easy to design nice landing pages. Much better than other landing page builders.
Support is ridiculously good. 
Thanks for all your help Toby."
The customer service is really great. The interface is easy to use. The best part is being able to update the GST rates of entire collections together.
"We have tried many review apps so far but no more we are looking for one since Stamped.io is just what we needed. Let me just say that none of them can compare to this app. It has really detailed and simple interface with all the features you need for your store's review section also you can send review reminder mails through app's internal features. They have such a support team that is really professional when it comes to helping and completing tasks that we could not managed to fulfill, they were always in the line when we need it.10/10 app and support!!"
"I really like this app. I am not a programmer by any means, so I have a hard time going into the Shopify code and making changes. I have found that the Shopify pages are difficult to customize, and I was looking for a way to improve my pages without going into the code and figuring out how it all works. Hypervision allows me to add images and text to my pages in a very easy-to-use way. They also have very good customer support. As of now they are still in the early stages, which means their creators are looking for feedback and quick to fix any problems I have had. I definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking to improve their pages but struggle to find how to do it within the Shopify interface. I plan to continue to use them as I think of new content to add to my site."
"We switched to Conversio after Mailchimp stopped integrating with Shopify.  Although it wasn't one of the suggested options for switching services, I was informed of Conversio by someone in the ""biz"" of email marketing and consulting.  We couldn't be happier with Conversio!  Although there are no free plans, the price is minimal and the interface has been much better than Mailchimp in just about every way.  I wish we used Conversio from the beginning of our online journey - but now that we have it, we won't be switching.  The integration with Shopify was seamless and the available features are well worth the subscription."
"I got this to replace Mailchimp since their integration with Shopify is ending. I really like the wide variety of pre-made templates for follow ups with customers, and after a month I've already seen a few conversions from them. It's relatively interface friendly, as someone not super tech savvy it's been pretty straight forward to build emails. I am a bit bummed about the monthly price, as I was on a free plan with Mailchimp and being such a small company, I don't need to send excessive amounts of emails, but hopefully over time it will prove to be worth the price. 
I will say there are a few features that have been difficult for me to implement on my own, even with the Conversio instructions. I had to get their help to verify my domain to intergrate my email marketing customer list from Shopify. I also reached out for help with adding code/widget to show reviews left through Conversio follow up emails, but they wouldn't help me without charging me a fee. I feel if I am paying a monthly fee, it should include help with these available features if their provided instructions are not enough for me to complete on my own. Other than that, I've enjoyed the service so far and hope it will work out long term."
It was great interacting with a very helpful support team and I found the interface easy and purposeful.
"Owner of igbaa.com here.
Love this app for new product launch. Smooth interface and easy to use. Definitely will recommend this app. The app allows you to add single products or multiple products at once."
"EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE !!
They have been very prompt!
it's simple 
it's user friendly with very clear user interface. I am trying it out"
"Absolutely fantastic. The first time I am jumping on the review right after installation. I am developing many websites for my client and according to the country I am using PRE-ORDER NOW and ADVANCE PRE-ORDER when I need partial payments. Both are great apps (PRE ORDER NOW is really good) but they missing the features from each other (cart warning message, partial payment, discounts etc) so it si complicated to use as if you need partial payment you will, for example, miss the cart warning message etc. Guys, Globo Pre-order is doing everything. I really installed with ABSOLUTELY NO EXPECTATIONS as it is free...but man, I was like ""ok they have this feature, but sure I won't be able to do that"", and each time they proved me wrong. They understood EVERYTHING to our needs and you can be sure they spent huge time trying apps of competitors. It is super easy to configure for beginners ('nice step by step' guide. congrats.) and the interface is crystal clear (not like advance pre-order). I assume it is free so they can get clients and reviews before starting to charge s so guys, install it now as you are going to save $29/month ! The highlights of the app for me : mix cart warning message, the fact you can display upfront payment AND partial payment options for a same product, pre -order on variants not just the full product... congrats guys"
"A very good user interface, a big field for customization and amazing customer service! Well recommended 5/5"
I like the new interface.  Very nice.  Upgraded to Premium to get the most of the product and to get a dedicated expert.
"Great app! Love this interface, super easy to use. Hope this brings me more sales - I believe it will."
It is user friendly and integrates seamlessly with Shopify. Great user interface. Customer support is top notch. You will get a response in less than 1/2 hour. Rachel was super helpful with my question on how to move out the capture date of a customer's monthly charge.
"We tried a few different pre-order apps before settling on Globo Pre-Order, their app has what we need and functions well, easy to use interface and the support is outstanding, quick response and over and above the call of duty to support us - I HIGHLY recommend them and we'll be checking out their other apps"
Great app but could be more intuitive in the interface or have better integration with the shopify app
"The app is easy to use and has a great interface, it was also easy to install and in less than a few minutes it was up and running on my page. Best of it is the team promptness to help."
"The app works great - frankly it blows other landing page builder apps out of the water. I tried several before going to zipify. All the other ones were either buggy, had non-intuitive interfaces, or lacked the features I wanted. Zipify solved all of that. In addition they have a really great support team that is standing by to help you out if you have questions. Don't waste your time with other LP builder apps - zipify has what you need."
I love the interface and how easy it was to set up! I would definitely recommend Marsello to a friend.
"This app amazing - it is so easy to use and the menu options just flow with ease of use. I selected it for our new business then thought, ""lets have a quick play around for 5 minutes"". 3 hours later and I had literally customised every single setting for our business and created a functional loyalty rewards system too! And its all done now until I want to modify it!
I love the user interface (so easy to understand) and the fact that you can add easily change things around without needed to code anything. The fact that I constructed every single email transaction for every event possible and a fully scalable loyalty system in 3 hours (when I wasn't even planning to do so"" speaks for itself.
And the ultimate kicker - its free! Obviously its only free for a certain number of customers but I can easily say that I cant wait to get more customers and will happily pay for this app to service all of them. Great work guys and gals - super happy new client here!!!!!"
"i love how easy it is to use and it have a very colorful interface. it is one of the most helpful apps i have, now only if i coudl get more customers and better marketing."
"started using this app recently and really think these guys have the outlook to be the best email platform in the game.
the reviews and email flows really go hand in hand i was skeptical at first but i realise the interface is most user friendly ive tried and this makes it a winner.
thank you"
One of the best apps there for flows! Love the concept and the easy to use interface. The email automation app you will need! Use Marsello
I had a code and user experience problem with the Weglot application and I had Christophe (member of the staff) who was able to respond effectively and especially QUICKLY to my problem to solve it. I clearly recommend this app to anyone who would like to use a pro translator!
"Great app,simple interface and looks great suitable to any theme for all the stores,I totally recommend"
"Wiser works Wisely! Just an amazing app to setup increasing sales. I was much impressed with its unique options and intuitive interface. Not to mention, the support team is really awesome! Karishma from the support team helped me in setting up the app features. Kudos to the team!"
"Free plan is gold for new shops. The interface looks clean and tidy, a must have for your shop! I would recommend this."
I am using this app and its working so good and so useful. Easy to use dashboard interface and team behind the app is so helpful.
"Easy interface and great customer service, thanks! Would recommend for a return management app service"
"I am using the app to translate my website from EN to DE and it works great - the interface is easy to use. Moreover, Margaux from the Weglot team has been extremely helpful and answered all my questions with thunderbolt speed. Totally recommend Weglot!"
"Really good on optimizing your ecommerce, but doesn't have a good interface (good = straightforward) in my opinion. In general, it's pretty good."
Great GUI interface for making your shop pages. Impossible to do in Shopify's limited page interface. So much functionality and ease of use. Great service from MAX and Karl. I highly recommend Shogun for managing all your pages.
I used this app to provide a better user experience and it works very smoothly. Marcus helped us with the final settings very quickly to make it more customizable for our website.
"bonne application très pratique, elle permet d'économiser un temp fou, son interface intuitif est facile d'utilisation"
"Great app, highly reco. It got the features I want, and easy interface to use every function. Impressed with the work."
"I used the app to manually translate my site from English to French. The interface is easy to use, responsive and allows me to feel confident that all the content on my site has been translated."
"Mobikul App Maker is an amazing mobile app builder with rich design and functionality features which you will hardly find elsewhere. Additionally, Mobilkul offers exceptional customer support. Unlike other mobile builders, the app is rich in functionality, support multi-currency, multi-lingual and the team is always open to new ideas to improve the user experience of this wonderful app. Simple pricing packages reflecting great understanding of the user and market needs and once you have additional requirements, you need not to worry, they got you covered. I always had great support from the team, I talk to them directly and they never Disappointed me. They customized according to how I want my mobile app to look like while I am still in a Trial Period knowing I can uninstall anytime and leave their efforts to waste. Who would do that for you? I believe a good business comes with best customer service. I recommend to use Mobikul mobile App builder for their website and wish their team the best of success for the great job they are doing."
Great app and great simple interface for settings! Loved the sample email. It allowed me to a see what the customer will see and exactly where I would like to make changes! When not a lot of people sent me Birthday gifts it was always nice to receive emails and discounts from retailers! It added a personal touch and I want the same for my customers!!!!!!
Super easy interface. I have no doubt it will entice customers.
"Does what it says on the tin. You have the option of sending 2 timed emails and can customise the email templates to how you want them. The interface is clean and you have full control about whether an email is sent or not - useful since the app pulls in very recent abandoned carts and schedules cart recovery emails for them. Had it installed on my working store for less than 24 hours and recovered a cart already. Worth the money, especially when combined with the Persistent Cart app."
"Keeping Us updated. Good system, Highly recomended.
Very good interface, a lot of knowledge!
I give you A+ :-)"
"This app is awesome! It creates really professional looking mega menu and the interface was easy for a newbie!
The support team also responded promptly when I had an issue with the app. It was resolved within 1 day and they were so helpful throughout.
5 stars for the app and 5 stars for the team too!"
"Very responsive support, very reasonable pricing for very capable app. 5 stars easily. User interface is very easy to understand also ."
This shopify app is simple to install and has a clean interface. Marcus was quick to respond and a great help.
"Instalei e a principio tive alguns erros, mais contatei o suporte e foi resolvido rapidamente, sobre a interface, e muito boa, obrigado pela ajuda"
"Muito bom esse aplicativo para mostrar os melhores reviews na minha loja, interface muito bonita e interessante."
"Good App, I really love it, the interface is well designed and system is really good, im so glad i found this app"
Looks good and helps conversions. I really like this app because the interface is simple and the support is fantastic!
Good and easy to use App! perfect for better user experience. Hope that helped you for now. I think i will keep using it.
"We haven't dived down deep on it but from an overall experience its decently well, Interface looks clean as well and that's a big plus for us."
"The best business app, we have used in the market place. The support team our absolutely excellent and considering we have our own in house we development team, the interface ease of use is immense. It is a joy to use and gives us everything we need to know about our stock levels, future purchasing, revenue and end of year projections. Excellent!"
"So far using the app experience is great, good interface and great support from Shubham with Live Chat."
"This is our experience with Shoelace:
- Already had a few sales in the first couple of weeks thanks to Shoelace, with very little ad spend on Facebook retargeting, and with no effort on our end apart from installing the app and creating our message.
- Very helpful personalised customer service and they go the extra mile to show us how the app works to our benefit.
- Always responsive to messages and show they care and interested in us succeeding with our campaigns.
- Great intuitive interface and simple to use.
- Really like the auto campaign suggestions.
Thank you Shoelace team especially to Reza and Nancy who have helped us get set up and settled with the software. I look forward to more sales coming from Shoelace as I create more campaigns from it.
Regards,
J"
Great app with a great interface and easy importing of reviews. Also have easy integrations with other apps
"We've switched Stamped.io platform after using LoyaltyLion & Judge Me for 2 years. Now, stamped.io Loyalty and Stamped reviews work much seamlessly and more flexible than before. The migration process was very seamless. 
User interface is very similar to Shopify, that's why it is much easier to our staff. Also, stamped io provides external staff login by which we don't need to give access to all apps for those who need to be admin in Stamped. 
Support staff is amazing, replying and resolving problems less than a day. As enterprise customer, I've never seen such a great team that are very flexible, quick and helpful. One of the many update requests, for example, we asked to give points to customers only if their review, photo or video is approved. It has been done in a couple of days. 
If you think that Stamped.io Loyalty is new and less experienced than others, I guess you're wrong because Stamped io platform is much capable, robust and easy to use for both customers and staff."
"Fantastic app, I tried many other pre-order apps including top rated ones and this is the only one that provided an easy interface, worked well and was free from serious bugs in core features - all the others failed on all 3 accounts! When I had a minor issue (which did not affect my selling!) the service team had it sorted very very quickly. Hope to work with them for a longtime."
"Have been looking forward to getting into this app and upgrading our emails for out upcoming new site. Unfortunately for me, it has become a hassle.  The biggest headache is that after you spend considerable time on customizing an email, most of those customizations do not carry over to the next notification template. This did not seem correct so I checked the FAQ and it says to use the ""Replicate"" feature.  Well I can't seem to locate it.  Additionally, when going into he company settings, I continue to get a login error.  This is after I am already logged in.  Even after resetting the password it still gives the username / password error and will not log in. Very frustrating!
The vast majority of reviews seem to speak well of the app.  So take my experience with a grain of salt and I would recommend you try the app for yourself before making a decision.  For me however, it just seems to be a bit too quirky for the price. 
Speaking of price, for the amount charged on mid to high tiers, there really should be a few more quality templates available to choose from. While the ones available are decent, it would still be nice to have a larger selection.  Perhaps more will come in the future. For now, be prepared to do a good bit of customization.  The interface is easy enough to work with though and you should get the hang of it quite quickly.  Good luck!"
"Spently is a great app for people unfamiliar with coding or wanting to spend hours trying to learn how to create automated emails. This app does it all, with a simple easy to use interface which has allowed me to monetize my business. five stars."
"I used this app to link up my three sales channels and to allow Shopify to become my hub for all. It is outstanding! After a brief period of getting used to its interface I find it very simple to use despite its huge amount of function. There are cheaper but less equipped options out there, but I was sold after incredible tech help and customer service. Replies are fast and any issues I had as swiftly dealt with. John has been particularly good on this front and helped get me up and running FAST!"
A must have app. Great Support team and easy to use interface for creating shopify email notifications.
"I tried for a week to interface to eBay using another plugin with no success, I loaded Codisto LINQ and was up and running in an hour. It's a great solution for interfacing with eBay and Amazon with a great support team behind it."
"Guy and your dev team, you have made us the best app..so intuitive and fun, smooth interface...you must have done your user stories really well...thank you!"
This app was super easy to set up and it blends well into my websites interface! Very happy that there is a free version as I am just testing out the subscription model
"Very practical app for running and managing subscriptions! Easy to use and to implement. Amazing support from Henry, who helped us fix a few things to improve our store's user experience. Would definitely recommend this app!"
Simply remarkable! Has a very simplistic interface which makes it quite handy to use. Would definitely recommend it to everyone.
Great software! Neat interface! Works well for our website www.bluejadeservices.com
Just tested out Omega Instant Search and I really like the interface it's easy to use for myself and for the prospective customers. Makes selling a fun experience.
"A simple and functional application that deserves 5 stars for a friendly interface and easy installation. Five Star Support. Clear and concrete communication has impressed me. Overall impression for 5+! Sincerely grateful, nina-trade.com"
Fantastic app with great user experience and results for very reasonable price point.
"A very detailed app with numerous options. A must have if you need to export orders with line item options (not included with the built in Shopify export functionality). The interface is a little daunting, but Adam helped with setting up exactly what I needed."
Great app so far. I love the user interface. Will keep you updated along my journey. Tested a lot of different app. So far so good.
"Seems to be a great app, with a easy interface. Very happy with the support from Raj. Will give it a few weeks and see how it goes."
Great app.User friendly interface.Detailed support with deep info.We use it for amazon and ebay integration.Also variant group/merge/separate  works great.
"Brilliant! Image quality is especially important to us as a site selling premium quality wall art based on Scott's photographs. To be able to reduce image size but in a lossless way is critical. Minifier was able to do this quickly across all our product images with a very easy to use interface. We'll be using this app again as our store continues to grow and amend product images.
Happily recommend to others."
"The products looked promising. But I gave up trying to use it, because it is just too slow, and too difficult to use. 
Too many details needed to be handled manually - using a terrible interface. 
Would have appreciated it if it was presented in a step-by-step manner. Like
0. Upload a design. 
1. Choose a Tee
2. Choose all sizes you want
3. Choose all colors you want
4. Choose underbase
5. Mock up options
Or something. Instead I see page after page of words that drive me nuts. 
That's even before i see the damned mockup. 
Pity."
"My absolute favorite of all of the fulfillment companies.  The prices and products are fantastic.  The app isn't all that complicated for the products I use them to fulfill (pillows, blankets, totes, etc...) 
TOP NOTCH communication from these folks.  They have responded VERY QUICKLY to all questions I have had and they go above and beyond to make things work for you.  I recommend Gooten.  If you find the interface difficult - it's like everything else - you have to learn how to use it.  Start with a single product type and then reach out and ask them questions if you can't figure it out.  But, definitely give them a real try before moving on because I don't think you'll find a better fulfillment service.  They have shipped every order within the given estimated time frame and have even shipped some of them out in less than the predicted time.  I'm very pleased with this service.
The only negative - and I do mean ONLY - for me has been figuring out how to charge shipping.  It was very difficult to set up something that would work since the shipping charges vary by product and by area of the country you are shipping to.  But if you can get past that hurdle - this is the service I'd highly recommend."
"Really great service, like the products.  Love the personal attention to customers, I always get a great answer and they take my feedback very seriously.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Interface is fairly straightforward and they are updating stuff all the time to make it easier and easier."
"This has been a go to tool for us to increase total order value and drive a streamlined user experience for upsells throughout the site. Could not recommend this more, it's outstanding and the support team behind it is top notch."
"We LOVE gooten! 
Such a good interface and powerful tool four on-demand business."
Great apps to improve conversion and user experience! And it provides free plan for us to try first even before we decide to go for it!
"This app absolutely rocks! It helped me identify a lot of flaws in the store design & I took those inputs to improve. For new store owners this is an absolute requirement. Go for it, the value is beyond measure and user interface & observations are a breeze with this app. Once you check this out, you will not search any further, makes life easier."
"So far, this app seems amazing. I'm still new to it, but it seems like a great, comprehensive solution to Messenger and I LOVE how many different ways there are of acquiring new leads and the customizability. I'm looking forward to trying it with SMS marketing and upgrading to their paid plan. The interface is awesome and easy to work with and support is great. Also the tutorial videos are extensive and extremely well put-together. 100% recommend."
Great Messenger App. Excellent Tutorials. Intuitive Interface. Great Functionality... and Katie from the Support Team was very helpful.
"Hands down the best messenger platform app. Feature-rich, top notch customer support, great front-end interface, and it seems they're constantly working to expand features. Do yourself a favor and switch over from whatever you're using."
Good and convenient interface. I had some problems with support but after my complain then the team was incredibly helpful trying to solve my issue.  Recommended app for sure.
Easy to use. Simple instructions and very clever interface. No trouble at all to install and start tu use it right away. Did what is says.
"Pretty simple interface, does everything it says. Developer was very helpful and added a couple of feature requests."
"No way to sort/organize your rates in the backend interface making it a nightmare to juggle more than a few rates. It does what we need it to but is not even close to being user friendly. Built a user base as a free app, but they have yet to make any improvements or add any features since they started charging for it though that was their claimed reason."
"This software is very convenient to use, and the operation interface is also simple, which I like.
I will continue to use this Facebook Messenger"
"Seems to work well, as far as I can tell. Does the job! Nice user interface, pretty simple to understand. One thing I noticed is that it doesn't have an option to not add a 'Compare Price' - so by default it just adds a compare price to any products that don't have a compare price. This should be fine in most cases, but I'm sure some people like to have no 'compare prices' on at least SOME products."
"Great app, we are managing 3 stores and this app makes managing our feeds a breeze. The support team is super helpful, showing us screencasts, giving ups tips. The app has a lot of features allowing us to manage all our feeds into one single interface!"
"8/31/2018 Update: It looks like the original developer sold the app and now Parcelify is a paid app (it used to be free). We previously gave this 5 stars because it was a free app and it performed the intended function well. Now that it is a paid app though it should have a much easier to use interface. Setting up rules is complicated and time consuming. There are certain things that are trivial but add up; they price things in cents instead of dollars, you have to use certain keyboard symbols for and/or etc. They don't have a way to easily exclude US territories etc. It's a good app, but if they want customers to pay for it they should really consider updating the user interface.
Original Review: The standard Shopify shipping options are an absolute joke. This app certainly has a learning curve, but once you get the hang of it the power of it is incredible. We are now able to offer all sorts of different shipping options since we can assign them at the SKU level, which is bringing us significantly more profit.
You do need carrier calculated shipping to use the app (it's not an app issue, it's a Shopify restriction) which is only available on the Shopify Advanced plan. After some research you can call Shopify and ask for this feature and they will turn it on for $20/MO (you have to call though, this isn't advertised anywhere). If you switch your billing to annual they will also turn this feature on for free (you just call in and ask them to turn it on).
Side Note: Shopify includes territories that are not states (Puerto Rico, Guam, Armed Forces Americas, Virgin Islands etc.) in the United States dropdown… so the US rates you setup will default to including those territories. Be sure to exclude them as states in Parcelify if you don't want your USA rates to pull to those territories."
"Wanted to add a free shipping option, but exclude certain regions. Parcelify did everything we wanted in a clean, simple interface."
"Shopify falls short when you have products that require truck shipping. I tried a bunch of paid apps before this one and found that most are US based and are not set up for  Canadian freight companies. Another app in the store showed promise but wouldn't  work with Canadian FedEx ltl accounts. I have established rates with many Canadian freight companies, some local, some national that will probably never interface with shopify.
What this app allowed me to do was create shipping rates that would populate in the checkout for products that were too heavy to ship by Canada Post, FedEx and Ups. I was able to select products by sku that would trigger the truck freight rate  and then calculated the rate based on the subtotal of the cart. It works pretty slick and has a lot more flexibilty to calculate rates by weights and more.
Prior to this app, I created a message asking the customer to request a freight rate when no rates were available for those items that couldn't ship with C Post, FedEx and Ups and people would abandon many carts. Now the customer can see a rate and I ship with the freight company of my choice. No need for special account integrations with multiple carriers. 
I also used this app to apply a free shipping rate for a single product. I introduced a new product in my store and wanted to offer free shipping on it, and if the customer added a second item to the cart, calculated shipping rates would apply and the free shipping offer would disappear. With Parcelify, I am able to create a 'shipping rate' and apply a variety of filters to qualify it to appear. In my case, I was able to apply an individual product filter to receive the rate. I also only wanted to offer the free shipping rate to residents of Canada so I made another requirement for this shipping rate that only addresses with the country code 'CA' get to see the free shipping rate. So how does it work in the cart? What Parcelify does is it displays the free shipping rate in the checkout if the customer's address is from Canada and if the product is the one I selected. Parcelify doesn't suppress the calculated shipping rates, they are still showing but the free shipping rate is displayed at the top of all of the shipping options so it is easily seen. The Parcelify free shipping rate for this product will disappear if the customer puts another product in the cart because I also set the filters to require that all products in the cart must match the product that I selected in the filter, otherwise the free shipping rate will disappear. Parcelify allows for great degree of filtering options and additional weight and price based rates. 
PS. There are some reviews from some whinners saying the app is not free and you need calculated shipping. Here are the facts. My store is on the basic $29 plan. Call Shopify and prepay an annual store subscription and Shopify will give you calculated shipping on the basic plan. That's how I got it, now you know how to get it."
"If you're serious about Google Shopping, Facebook ads, or just growing your store through new channels, you need to be using DataFeedWatch. The new interface makes feed management a breeze and gives you features beyond any free Shopify app to increase your sales."
"Great app, simple to use and good user experience!
Works better than a lot of payed apps while being free! Thank you."
"This app is definitely a must for all HK store that use SF express. The interface, and SF details provided are so up to date and accurate, it's 100% worth what we paid for. Also, the support team is probably the best we have even encountered. They are willing to help at their best ability and come up with excellent solution for problems encountered. 100% recommended!"
The app integrates with Shopify checkout page so well. Friendly user interface and smooth user experience for customers! In addition I'd like to highlight that the Wave Commerce Team is so helpful and offered professional customer service.
"I installed this app a few days ago. I changed from another app because it wasn't user-friendly when it came to answering messages and I didn't particularly like the message interface on the website. I find JivoChat very easy to use and was really easy to set up. I also love the chat box and I have had a few people use it already, so I am very happy so far."
This app is bad ass!  I like that the clean and professional user interface that because it enables me to give my site visitors a Big Time presence!  If you want to communicate INSTANTLY with your site visitors you should get this app.
"I've been a customer of Skubana since they began, and the experience so far has been pretty remarkable.  The features they offer are powerful yet intuitive, and they roll out with new functionalities on almost daily basis.  The number of features they offer is pretty ridiculous actually.  You would literally have to combine NetSuite + ShipStation + Teikametrics + AutoMCF + Hublogix + Shipwire to get the full scope of what they offer, and you get all this in one centralized interface for a fraction of the cost.
There are no set up fees, no signup fees, no contracts, no custom development, nothing!  It's all out of the box integrations with a simple pay-as-you-go consumption model, and I can leave any time -- which I would never do because these guys and girls truly work hard to not only earn my business, but actually keep it.
Speaking of which, their customer service is top notch -- attentive, helpful, knowledgeable and readily available.  They take time out of their day to show me every little corner of Skubana to ensure I get the most out of the software. That sort of hospitality and patience made me feel like I’m the favorite customer.
The whole experience has changed my view on what an e-commerce software can be, or I guess what it should be!  If you are serious about selling, you owe it to yourself to try Skubana.  You won't be disappointed."
"I was tried different chats because I'm very pretentious in the end jivo chat was exactly for that i looking.
all inclusive in 1 chat, allow you make automatization by yourself, very friendly interface, full customization and very very easy to work. Amazing support. 
Im very happy, highly recommend!"
Interface could be better. I still need to test everything out
"GemPages is by far the best page builder app out there, after trying them all I can honestly say GemPages are way ahead in their field thanks to: 1) Amazing interface that is virtually limitless in its possibilities, whatever and however you want your store to look like, it's possible with GemPages, including the ability to edit elements code and insert custom code into your page. 2) Super easy to separately edit Mobile and Desktop views which is so important these days, including home page, collections page, product pages, sub-pages, and more. 3) Last but not least, and maybe most important, GemPages customer support is by far the best support I've gotten from an online service. Their amazing customer support team goes above and beyond to solve any issues you might have, from small to major, and they make sure to update you along the process. I promise you that you will be amazed by GemPages abilities and that you will want no other page builder that is out there."
"Great support #RonelR #RhemyR, easy to implement, very good app interface, many useful tools to get ratings!"
great app! easy to work with and great support. Love the design and the user experience they have. :)
"GemPages is a fantastic app.. and their customer service is the best in the world! You can build any kind of landing page, product page, and home page. They are constantly updating more features and developing the user experience. I highly recommend."
"L'application est plutôt complète, a l'essai pour le moment. Interface sympa."
this is an awesome plugin for a shopify store . Works perfectly! interface is great.
"Great app! Love the interface and how easy it is to navigate. Great features within the free tier, so that's awesome."
"Great app! very simple interface, support are friendly, I think you the best! I wish you good luck with your business!"
This was really easy to import my reviews from a different app. I really like the interface. Clean and innovative! Thank you Fera
"Dam this is one cool app. looks amazing and has the most user friendly interface I've seen, great customer care too"
"Super easy to set up, I love the self explained, flowing interface. I love what this app can do for my shop, and for free! And, on top of it all - the great, super helpful, patient and efficient support by Naomi, that speeded it all up even more. Thank you!"
"We genuinely love this app! It's brilliantly easy, clean interface and support are outstanding - and fast. And it does what it says. It should do more! We want more!"
The app was easy to set up and was up and running quickly. The interface is intuitive and easy to use. Would recommend!!
"Do not use this App. This app is a web based piece of crap with bad user interface. There will be other app which also does the same thing but this app uses a SLOW API and really bad INTERFACE. Again, A REALLY BAD INTERFACE. It's like a Grade 6 student made the website"
"This app is exactly what I was looking for, and more! The interface is easy and intuitive and the design options are more than plenty. The chat support is also extremely helpful and quick to respond. Amazing app!"
ShipStation is hands down the best shipping service we have ever used! The easy to use interface makes the whole shipping process a breeze! Great Service and overall a great app!
"We're very impressed with ShipStation, its proving to be a boon for efficiency here at vitrazza. We easily connected with our shopify store and amazon seller account, and then with 3 different shippers we use. The interface is awesome, reports are great and having all our orders aggregated just makes it all so much easier. Highly recommend."
Very simple interface. Customer support is fantastic when you need help! Glad we picked this app!!
"Beautiful interface, intuitive to use (maybe because I watched the video!), lots of information right at my fingertips, and quick response and load times."
Very helpful and awesome SEO application. Strongly recommended fixing so related errors. Great tool and its free.Very helpful tool plus a nice interface.
"We downloaded this app to try the refer to a friend option. It does integrate well, there is no need of extra coding unless you want to customise the interfaces a bit more. It does integrate with Mailchimp, but haven't quite understood yet if it syncs the info automatically or you have to push them every time. The support team is quite helpful, I spoke to Dwight to get help with the Mailchimp integration part."
Very helpful and awesome SEO application. Strongly recommended fixing so related errors. Great tool and its free.Very helpful tool plus a nice interface.
Great support. excellent app. Easy to use interface backend and front end as well. Great app for printing..
I needed an app that allowed users to apply their own images onto the products that I offer. That is exactly what I am getting here. Easy to use interface and if I need any help the support team has always been able to help me quickly each time
"So happy with the customer service provided by Referral Candy. I contacted them by LiveChat and Mardie replied to my message in seconds. She was so kind and helpful. This is so important for any service you provide: how fast and efficient you reply back to your customers' concerns. Thank you so much again, Mardie, YOU ROCK! The software's been working great till now. A very friendly interface and clear information provided all the time. Highly recommended"
"This app allowed me to create a designer tool to let customers customize our product. The interface could be a little easier and the documentation could go more in depth on details, BUT the support is amazing. They quickly responded within a day to take care of all my tweaks and adjustment needs. Highly recommend this company!"
"What is this magic? Not kidding. Just plain incredible. Re:amaze... I have been Re:amazed and Re:awoken to what a CS tool should be. We've been so frustrated with tools like Zendesk and other CS tools that do a small piece of what we need but don't tie it all together. Just plain WOW with you guys. You really do get it and understand what it's like to sit in the CS seat. You've thought out the user experience from the POV of a CS help rep and you've made their job easier and better. You've provided so much more than we expected and we're excited to bring amazing service to our customers through your incredible tool! Thanks so much for seeing the potential to create what we really need. Can't recommend any Shopify app higher than this one. Dead serious, it's the absolute best."
"At first, the name Re:amaze was confusing to me, but after being on the platform for two months, it makes perfect sense...it IS amazing!
Our store's average order amount is $5,500 and people don't just spend that kind of money on a whim. Our customers are researchers, they visit our site numerous times before even identifying the product they want. Before Re:amaze, we were using Zendesk's chat tool. It worked, as a chat tool, but our customers needed more than that and truthfully, I didn't know how to identify what our customers needed...but Re:amaze already knew and they had it sitting there ready to go. It's a chat platform in front, and an entire customer support ecosystem in the back. From the live view we are able to see our visitors, where they are from, whether they're already a registered customer in our store, what products they have in their cart, their site history breadcrumbs, etc. Then we're able to selectively interact with them if we see behavior that warrants us reaching out, or, we can build out cues that have the system interact with the customer for us based on page visits, behavior, etc. and it is all 100% customizable through their interface, and can be dug into deeper if you know how to code/program. Never has a little chat bubble in the corner of a site done so much for our business.
Within just a couple of days, I had an entire customer-facing support and communication platform up and running, and running well (I'm OCD and incredibly analytical so a normal personal probably could have done it faster). Within the first 72 hours of being live on the site we had our first sale thanks to Re:amaze making it so easy for our customers to reach us, but it didn't stop there. We had real-time information about the customer and their sale right there inside Re:amaze. The customer was able to view their order status immediately, just furthering that rapport that we previously would have had to work incredibly hard to do.
We've all used an app that was either form over function, function without form or that just flat didn't work. Re:amaze not only has its foundation, its primary function, nailed down but it looks good while doing it. Their chat widget, which they call an embeddable, looks absolutely stunning and it's the zippiest widget we have on our site. Little things like being able to either show the avatar of chat operators who are active or a custom one, to modifying every single piece of text to ensure the verbiage matches your brand. It does all of that and SO much more and they have made it nearly effortless to navigate the admin side of things and make these changes live, in real-time for your customers to use.
An app is only as good as the support system behind it, and yet again, the Re:amaze team has that figured out and they've done it better than some of the multi-billion developers/vendors we've been working with for years and a lot of that has to do with their ability to support you directly through Re:amaze. I haven't had to wait longer than an hour for them to respond to a question, and most of the time they respond within minutes.
We cannot thank the Re:amaze team enough for all they have done to build this product and especially for supporting us so well as we worked to integrate it into our workflow. Thank you, Re:amaze!"
Are you kidding me! This is such an amazing app that simplifies all of the multiple channels of customer inputs and feedback all into one simple interface - CRUSHING IT now on my CRM management - Thanks Re:amaze!
I used this app for a couple of days now. The support was awesome. They sorted out two problems with our shop very quick. The app itself is easy understandable we got into it very fast.  Did enjoy the support and easy user interface.
"We LOVE Re-Amaze! A lot of our customers use a combination of their Facebook credentials and email to communicate with us, which resulted in us flipping through multiple systems to figure who we were talking to and what their order history is.  With ReAmaze everything happens in on clean easy to use interface.  We also love that we can serve up our FAQ right in the chat window.
#PowerfulReAmaze"
This is an esay to use app. The interface is user friendly. Its great for dropshipping businesses.
"I really like the interface of the app. It makes your website look far more elegant than it already is.
We are facing a lot of struggle when it comes to understanding the app as it is complex. With Stephen's help, it makes things a lot easier."
I like this app as it really helps my mobile ranking in Google. And it is quite easy to setup too. The interface is clean and easy to navigate.
"So far, so great. I came across this app early on in my build for our new e-shop (open end of June ... plug) and although I've not yet used it in anger I have to say I'm more than impressed; it has all the angles covered for me. I particularly like the tie in between customer service questions which, if relevant, can morph into a knowledgebase question which I post from the app to my knowledgebase page in seconds. Love it. In this current trend of ""beautiful software"" (Shopify, Xero, Tradegecko etc) I'd add Reamaze to this list. Almost. A little more tarting up of the user interface would get it there. Meanwhile, a great tool for customer service ... which is what it's all about at the end of the day."
"The interface should be improved on for the reason of aesthetic. Other than that, everything on this app works well. I would still give it a 4.6/5."
This app helped me in marking my product that were on promotion for a better user experience. Would recommend it
Not sure yet. Just started using. The interface was easy to install though. Lots of customizable settings already in place for success. Next step is to see if it works well in the store.
"Quick view is an important feature for the user experience on any ecommerce store. This app delivers the needed functions as promised. 
Using the Supply Shopify theme, the quickview buttons that show up on a hover over a product listing image are slightly off-center to the left and show a bit farther up from the bottom of the image on some products than others. 
I also found that the quickview buttons started appearing in the general vicinity of thumbnail-sized product images if they linked to product pages. Unlocking these images removed the problem.
I'd say both of these are minor concerns and fair tradeoffs to  get a free feature that improves the overall ease with which a customer can add products to their cart."
Great app! Use it to facilitate user experience
We believe this app has greatly simplified the user experience of our online store.
"The best App I've used on Shopify, and quite possibly the best I ever will.
I'd recently launched my Facebook and Twitter accounts for my store, and wanted to raise awareness and drive traffic to them. This App is truly fantastic at both. There are so many ways that you can reward and/or incentivise customers to perform different actions like making a purchase, answering questions to give you some market insight, following you on Twitter, the list is plenty big enough for all my needs and more.
I signed up for the business package as this had all the features I wanted, most importantly being able to only include certain countries (I only ship to the UK) and having the competition tab located on my site.
The interface to set the competition up is pretty straightforward, and there's plenty of ways to customise things too. I'm very happy with this app and am looking forward to getting much more use out of it in future."
Gleam has built an incredibly easy and solid promotion interface.  We just completed our first promotion and grew our social audience in a big way.  Looking forward to running more promotions in the future.
"Gleam has quickly become an essential app for us. The competitions are really fun for not only our customers, but for us as a small company. It's given us a chance to connect with Modern Industry fans in a whole new way and show them how thankful we are for their support.
Gleam's interface is really quick to set up and easy to use. Not to mention that the final result makes you look like you know what you're doing.
Using Gleam proves that you get what you give. Be kind to your audience and they'll be kind to you. If you really care about your customers and want to grow organically, you've got to try Gleam.
Cheers!"
"We're really impressed with Gleam. It's easy to set up and there are lot of ways to configure competitions and the way they integrate with different platforms. We've had a great response to the competitions we've run, and the vast majority of users seem to be able to use the interface without running into problems understanding what to do. If we had feature requests they would be greater ability to match appearance of the widget to match our site, ability to send entry confirmation emails via Mailchimp (so that they could be configured to match our other emails), and ability to add custom fields when entrants are added into Mailchimp (rather than just the name and email as it present). But overall, a great app."
Excellent customer service that goes above and beyond! Easy to use interface with a bunch of help options as well
Very impressed. We added over 300 likes/follows on Facebook and Twitter with our first competition. Great interface and easy to use. Highly recommend.
"I was very pleased with the service and support I received from Cart 2 Cart.  I was migrating a Volusion 1 site to Shopify with over 2,000 products and 4,000 customer records.  It's a bit of a leap to rely on a service like this to do an auto transfer of data, but their interface was pretty easy to use and the online chat was helpful during setup.
We launched the transfer late in the day and when I got up 9,000+ records were transferred.  We had a glitch in the data migration process, as a non-standard field we did not have mapped within Volusion did not transfer over.  Cart2Cart support handled it and within 24 hours we had revised the data mapping and had a perfect match.  
I would definitely recommend the Cart 2 Cart service."
"Excellent support! A great tool to use for reviews, good interface, lots of customisations, highly recommend it!"
"Fully satisfied so far. Great service and app userinterface. The results still have to show, but I'm sure they will come soon."
"The absolute worst user experience and service. The flow of this product is so terrible because it tricks you into continuously looping through setup so that it can continue to charge your card, and it also adds ""migration insurance"" (whatever that is"" onto your card. The people who run the support are 0 helpful, I'm not even sure they work at this company."
Excellent!  Great flexibility and easy to use.  I created my first popup in less than 10 minutes.  The interface is intuitive and I highly recommend it!
"This app is literally perfect. The design is modern and clean, the backend is extremely easy to use, and the user experience for customers from the gallery to the tagged product is seamless. We use the pro version because it is important to us that the products be tagged within the gallery to increase the likelihood of conversion. Also their customer service is top-notch- they've responded to us all hours of the day and night and even helped with customizations. If you're looking for a way to monetize your IG posts- this app is definitely it!"
"The custom CSS function really allows to fully manipulate the app to your needs, but also a great and easy interface to use and implement. This was great, thank you!"
"Service client au top ! Réponse immédiate, et aide irréprochable. Rest en communication jusqu'à temps que le problème soit résolu. Interface simple. Bonne application gratuite, je recommande."
Great app. Quick resolved issue. Friendly interface. Easy to install. Happy with this product. Recommended :)
"Very well built and easy interface.
good support staff.
Helped me set up and import all the reviews from amazon.
Keep up the good work.
Hoping to see new good updates."
"Customer service response is very fast and patient, professional, the app has many beautiful features, and the user experience is great."
"I didn't find the interface perfect to use (I couldn't easily see how to do a coupon only popup at first) but once I got there it worked perfectly and was way more customisable than the one in my Shopify theme.
I'd recommend the app for sure."
"Great user interface. The developer is friendly, knowledgable and an absolute pleasure to talk with. It's good to know the app is still being improved to become even better!"
"Super impressed with this app. Not only the interface, but also the functionality and very user friendly. But what sold me completely was the support they offer. Live chat support and always willing to help."
"Wonderfull APP!! Very good support team. The best thing about the app is, very fast and simple admin interface ! You don't need anything more than this app does"
"Great support, easy to navigate interface, helped me implement good looking round colour swatches for my colour variants when I was using both Shogun and Shopify."
"Although I've only been on Shopify for a week, this is by far the best app I've had. Does everything I wanted it to and more (with the buy feature in the photo descriptions) and so easy to use with shopify interface intergration. Wonderful UX."
"The app solved a lot of issues, the amount of customisation available allowed us to fine tune the look and feel of the swatches/buttons to get it exactly as we envisioned. We required some support from the development team and were amazed by the quality of work along with their friendliness and timeliness. Highly recommend this app to all users in need of an enhanced user experience! Great work guys!"
Very easy to use interface with lots of customizable options. The free option does not have intrusive branding like the other free plans for countdown timers so I chose this one. The ability to add a button is also a nice feature that we use. It could make the mobile countdown timer a bit bigger though that is the only complaint. Well-deserved 5 stars.
"Great app, easy interface and very flexible in what specific requirements you have for what can and can not be picked up."
"Couldn't be happier with the functionality and user experience this app has given me. I've been using it trouble-free for about 6 months now. During that time, I've needed some help from the developer to implement some enhancements. Each time I've reached out via email, I've received the help I needed within minutes - even though I'm based in Australia! Where else do you get responsive service like this? Happy to recommend to anyone who needs what this app offers. Thanks guys."
Excellent customer support—truly above and beyond. App is easy to install and very customizable. Simple interface allows one to easily make changes to pickup times and dates and availability (and locations).
A clean well thought out interface that works great.  Working with Drew was probably one of the best customer service experiences I've had in years and I can't say enough about the service he provided.  These guys do it right!
"Unbelievably good support staff.  The very best out of anyone I have ever worked with.
Easy to use interface also."
"I've been with Omnisend for the past 5 years while everyone else was gushing over Klaviyo. We tried Klaviyo, and the email builder was so clunky and not intuitive at all, and the customer service was just decent. I have always resonated so much with Omnisend's interface and how intuitive it was, from the email builder and automation flows, managing multiple accounts, and more. I could tell they were going to be BIG one day. Even till today, their support has been incredible and personal. Couldn't recommend them more as a powerful email / sms / push notification platform."
"Absolutely loving this app. I have had it for a week and have set up workflows really easily and found the options for segmentation far more advanced than the platform I used before. The interface is easy to use, I have had a quick response to any help queries from support. The team show the new functionality they have in the pipeline which is really helpful and already I can see upcoming functionality I can't wait to use! Just launched my first campaign, not too painful, the drag and drop is pretty straightforward."
This is a perfect app for our store. The user interface us easy to understand. Very helpful Support team.
Amazing and extremely useful application. Totally recommend because of the friendly interface and the way it works is smooth and nice
I love this app and their customer service. It has an easy to user interface and I think it is much better than Loox Reviews
"I really loved to use this App, it is very user friendly, very oriented to make our life easier avoiding the struggle understating the tools (Love the User Interface and User experience), very straight forward without spending so much time trying to understand all the logic behind, something to help you do it quick and effective without losing half of your day! Thanks Diego for your support yesterday, it was so quick and effective!"
"The team behind this is amazing. They're incredibly responsive to questions and feedback. The user interface is very easy to manage and maintain. I've tested several other instagram shoppable apps and this is by far one of the best apps out there, particularly because of the ability to create galleries with specific hashtags so this is handy for companies that have distinct product lines or want to get creative with promoting products. I'm confident this app will only get better."
"This app has a lot of great functions. Customer service is also very quick and good. The only negative comments is that the user interface is not as efficient or intuitive as it could be so it can take a long time to get it exactly as you want it. However, once you've set it up, it's great. If they could fix the UI, I'd give it 5 stars."
Awesome service and a really great platform! Look forward to getting our account fully set up and automations underway! Super quick interface also!
So far I really like it! The interface is extremely easy to use and even the free version is robust!
I love this app because it offers a very simple and easy to use interface. On top of that they have wonderful customer services and offer free training on maximizing your email marketing efforts.
"A good tool for working with the store, everything is created quickly and easily, and the interface is clear. Thanks to the developers"
"Excellent user interface!
What more do you want me to say in this minimum 100 characters description"
Really great and simple to use interface. Also the support was doing a good job when we requested for some small changes. Happy to recommend!
"UPDATE: Still AMAZING SERVICES! Love the customer service read below. I have seen my Average Order Value increase by over 70% & conversions via upsell triple vs previous app which cost me more, and almost receive an sale per order via Honeycomb Upsell Funnel A+!
ORIGINALLY:
First off Lynda with customer support is amazing, but let me give you all a little insight on my experience with Upsell apps and why I ended up with this one and so satisfied I felt inclined to leave a review :)! I've tried 3 different similar applications, all with the same exact offers, however the general user interface this one offers, the flexibility, and the perfectly seemless integration makes it one of a kind! My conversions for those of you looking for a comparison are at about 3-4x what I was getting in conversions from other upsell applications. So A+ Customer Service, A+ Effectiveness and Ease of Integration, and A+ for the Flexibility it provides. Don't waste your time, try this upsell app, and thank me later! Btw they also have an awesome trust badge app!!!! Beyond Happy!"
"Someone has already said this but, this app is probably the easiest I have encountered on the shopify platform. Great interface and quick. Now lets see if it helps me conquer the world!"
"So far everything has been great with this app. From the user interface as well as the simplicity and guides. And lastly, the customer service and help that I get from the support team is always exceptional. Definitely, don't hesitate to get this app and start messing with it will surely do wonders."
Absolutely fantastic user experience and exactly what I was looking for!I am yet to start using it for my Ambassadors but I am so excited!Set up was super easy and you can personalise it so much to your brand. I highly recommend. I am on the free plan at the moment but I am looking to upgrade when I can.
"Omnisend is super simple to use and yields fantastic results. The ability to add a pop-up to your store to get new subscribers is priceless. If you throw in a coupon for your store on sign-up the conversion rate is pretty great! The analytics are fantastic, and the user interface is very easy to use. It pays for itself each month in a fraction one newsletter/campaign."
"Great! Clear guided setup process, nice clean interface and in under 30 minutes you're ready to start inviting and receiving affiliates. Would most definitely recommend!"
"Awesome services, amazing support team. Downloading this app is a no brainer. The interface is very easy to get around, and a lotta features that I can't believe are free."
"I tried another app first, and it just didn't work. Installation was impossible. Deleted that and tried this which was actually my second choice. It should have been my first. This app is simply outstanding. Its interface is simple to use. All the options are customizable, which is something that the developers do not do a good job of promoting. If you want the pre-order button to be in Spanish (my case) or to say something other than pre-order, you can do that. Simple to install, simple to uninstall, it literally saved us this Holiday season when we had some issues with delayed deliveries from our overseas suppliers. If you're looking for an app that allows you to do pre-orders, stop looking and install this app."
"This app makes reporting out of Shopify possible, and intuitive. Anything beyond basic analytics is extremely difficult to pull natively out of Shopify. With Better Reports and its easy to use drag and drop style interface, we can pull all the data we need to run meaningful analysis on our store. We've run into a few snags, but support was very helpful in modifying our reports and even adding in some custom fields."
"I've used pre-order now for months and I love the functionality. Even after trying other apps, I've returned because of the simple interface. Their support team is also great and quickly respond to issues that have been reported."
Works perfectly! Prevents all theft from your store :) It has a really simple interface and it's pretty effective
Highly recommend Tapcart. Easy to use and beautiful interface that fits our brand perfectly. I can't believe how it seamless it was to create and develop our custom app. Thank you Sina and your team for creating such a great app!
"I needed a 'Pre-Order' app to allow customers to buy items which were in transit to my shop. I liked how their other apps worked, and gave this new app a try. I like the interface and ease of setup. Had a small problem with a new feature during early adoption which was fixed promptly. The only improvement I would like is a phone number or chat for support, other than email."
"When we realized that no one in our industry had a mobile app, we started looking around for options to be a trailblazer. After kicking around and testing a few mobile app makers, we decided that they were too ""clunky"" and ""heavy""  for our use so we put the idea on hold for a while. Fortunately, we discovered Tapcart and started the process to build it. From day one, Sina and his team have responded to EVERY question, concern or recommendation we have had and it feels like we've known them forever. The back-end interface is easy to understand and use and everything is spelled out in layman's terms with no technical jargon. The front end is SMOOTH and customers are already telling us how easy it is to navigate through the app. So, ease of use for us, coupled with a pleasant end-user experience, has made Tapcart our app builder choice. So far, we ca't say say enough good about the experience. Here's to the future!"
Great app. Offers option of scrollbox which is way better for user experience than popup.
Does everything it says on the tin and made updating nearly 400 pics and file names a 30 second task instead of a nightmare! Very intuitive User Experience and very reasonable price. Support was also fast and thorough!
"App is very easy to use, very intuitive interface. Excellent customer service! Pavi has been very helpful with resolving a few installation issues with my theme."
"This app has a great interface but unfortunately it randomly corrupted a scattering of images right across our site, including some collection images - this took a long time to sort out as there were over 1400 pictures to check.
Update: Developer working with us on issue - great support."
"I just downloaded this app and I have two things to say! 
1. This is the best app for the solution it provides and I have checked others before trying this out. It definitely does what it says and the user interface is great.
2. The customer support by Dako was one of the best I have experienced in a while. He really took the time to help me customise the app to my needs and the output was great.
For that it's easily a 5 STAR App.
However, I would say it's definitely a little pricier than some other apps and I think decreasing the price by $2-3 would lead to more customers for them. Also the app is not prefect (yet) and could definitely improve to smooth out some of the functionalities. 
To conclude, for what the app does and the customer service this app is definitely worth using."
I am using this app on my store and its an awesome app and works like a charm and very easy interface. Recommended.
"I needed some urgent help and Marcus helped big time , he made sure I got every support I needed , he was really professional and helpful The app is easy to manage and have very friendly interface."
Huge change from what I was using before. Interface is beautiful and easy to use. Great experience. Great service.
"I just discovered Automizely and I'm really impressed. The interface is really easy to use, which is very much appreciated for those of us who aren't very technical. Best of all is their customer service. When I asked a question through the support messenger, I was very happy to get a prompt, friendly response from an actual person. Lovish helped me right away with my question and I couldn't be happier. I highly recommend."
"Great app to use , it will make the user experience more easy and comfortable, it will save a lot of time and effort. They have a great support team responding immediately to the questions and inquiries , special thanks to Mr. Fennec for his beautiful and professional work."
Easy to use and good interface!
Excellent with Easy Interface. Had a Brand Video on my page in minutes. Absolutely incredible. You have to have this app.
"This app is very misleading, I feel like I was scammed out of $45. It looks 'okay' at first glance but it falls short of being a real multi-vendor marketplace solution for several reasons. Also, the English translations are TERRIBLE and I spent 2 full days just rewriting the entire store and creating help articles for my vendors (becuase the ones that Webkul have are horrible). But again, thats not even why this app is a bust.. let me explain.
Premium Pricing, But Not Premium Functionality
To get the marketplace to 'work' you'll need to add a bunch of different add-ons (including on Shopify's side). At the end of the day you're going to spending approximately $150-200 monthly between all the different add-ons and fees. At this price, you're better off just looking at different solutions that require upfront investment and are worth your money. 
Horrible Backend Interface + Bugs Bugs Bugs
The backend is littered with bugs. This software needs WORK, it needs a good polish and it needs it now. The interface is not intuitive at all and you'll be hard pressed to get vendors to use it without numerous questions about how to set up things. Something tha should take 1 or 2 clicks takes 5-6 and even then its not obvious how to update/change certain settings.
Why 2 Stars Instead of 1
I'm only giving 2 stars because admittedly the support was good. The Webkul team responded within 24 hours to each of my inquiries. But at the end of the day, this platform is not a good solution."
"Update!!  do not use if you want a professional working application! **** It’s dropped a star, now it’s garbage when you pay $45 a month!- why? Emails with an underScore “ _ “  not recognised when verifying which means two lost clients. updated with an “update” after the issue was reported but this is basic! Variants on products deleted/removed on any update = sellers have to re enter. I’ll up date this - a $45 a month app take ALOT of hours to make it work***** 
I’ve a very live site thinking it was stable and of a quality. It is not. 
It’s ok but not great. If I had the foresight  I have now I would have chosen a different product. What’s good- interface is user friendly, it does do what it is supposed to do. See caveats belo.
What’s poor-
1. Full of bugs (most of which have been addressed after tickets raised, however they we simple corrections. QA seems to be lacking)
2. Inbuild css is not always compatible across all devices.
3. The price point is for a premium product. It doesn’t reflect the quality expected for the price paid monthly.
4. Syncing with Shopify does not always seem successful. Missing images, descriptions, uploading images not loading etc. having to contact support to fix with 25 vendors and 350 products and growing. I don’t expect to have to manually check ever one!
5. Unable to add customer fields to invoices.. it still contains fax numbers as a default but no email.. legacy coding perhaps?.
Having raised over 25 support tickets  over the last few months it seems I spend a lot of time debugging / questioning software which  for $45 is steep for the bugs and formatting issues. Hopefully either webkul pick up their game or an alternative developer produces something of better quality."
"This app uses clever technology to improve user experience by preloading contents of webpages the user seems interested in, speeding up the website in the process. I like the thought process behind it and the available customization."
Great App. Just love it for its easy to use interface. Just what i have been looking for since i have been hunting for a replacement app to replace the Product Reviews app.
"Responsive and helpful support. User-friendly interface. Overall, a great loyalty program to encourage our customers to keep coming back!"
"Today I am celebrating my 1 month anniversary with Gorgias and I couldn't be happier. Mind you we migrated 4 separate Zendesk Basic accounts into 1 Multi-Store Gorgias Pro Account but the process could not have been more seamless and their team continues to exceed expectations at every opportunity. Mind you, in parallel we we operating with reduced personnel BUT I'm confident that without Gorgias we would not in the healthy state we are today in addition to the tremendous improvement we saw in our KPIs, see below:
Of our 4 stores existing within our 1 Gorgias Advanced account we've seen:
- 60-90% improvement in 1St Reply Time, 145 HRS w/Zendesk vs. 18 HRS with Gorgias
- 90% improvement improvement in Avg Open tickets a Day,  255/day w/Zendesk vs. 27/day w/Gorgias on avg
-20-40% improvement in % Tickets Solved, 59% w/Zendesk vs. 85% on avg w/Gorgias
Net/Net: You can't beat the price, intuitive interface, the modular flexibility, nor the support level. Best decision we made this year"
"A great messaging tool for businesses, the interface is simple and easy to understands. The snooze option is a definite plus with keeping the flow of tickets organized and clutter-free. Also, appreciate how easy it is to tag tickets without too many rules to do so."
"Gorgias seamlessly integrates with Shopify, providing easy access to the information that agents would need when resolving customer inquiries. Mostly, Gorgias has a super easy-to-use interface eliminating tiresome training time, great integrations, and valuable analytics that help us tag and understand what our business should prioritize in order to better serve our customer. To top it all off, the Gorgias team is responsive, agile, and constantly developing a better product.  Highly recommend - if you are on Shopify, it is a must."
"Very very good program and interface, easy to use and very effective"
"Great support, intuitive interface. Recommend to everyone! The Nexus Media Team solve my problem in minutes!"
"This is a great booking app works good with multi-users, nice interface, which would be even better for customising the colour/ theme! Also the CS is really helpful!! Thanks a lot!!"
Great app for managing customer service tickets all in one interface
"Great App - Easy to use interface, perfect solution to organise multiple customer channels. Fantastic integration into shopify and has improved our customer service experience. Their own customer support team delivers personal advice quickly. Would recommend."
"We've only had it for week, but looking good so far; definitely great to keep customer service separate from inter-office mail and organized going into the holidays with office closure. Only suggestion would be to create a cleaner, streamlined interface (especially where customer info is displayed on right side of conversation) with less ""comic-y"" font and have everything justified to the margins so info is easier to read vertically."
"Absolutely fantastic support, we encountered an issue on our end when setting everything up and the tech team at Sesami created a video tutorial to walk us through our specialized requirements.
The app works perfectly for us and love the interface. One piece of advise from the consumer end would be to change the advertising video as this nearly turned us off of the product."
"The software is very powerful. The interface is clean and beautiful. The macros and the tagging system, which can be color-coded and searched, are quite powerful. Love it!"
"Very nice interface, easy to use and fully customizable for large business requirements and specifications that my locations required"
"We use this app for a new startup that we just launched. I found Ehsan and his team to be very responsive with our queries. The admin interface is not intuitive, but the app actually has a lot of functionality even for complex features."
"I like the interface, and the app works better than others I have compared it to, but I wish I could schedule more than one appointment in a time slot without having to create more ""team members,"" as our appointments are not specific to a person and I think that will confuse people. Also I wish it had the option to add additional details, such as if the person is bringing extra people along."
The product works smoothly! Full marks to the logic and interface! Support (Anthony) is quite responsive and helpful!
Deveria ter um outras opções de línguas e interface com meios de pagamento do Brasil diretamente pelo app para torna-lo melhor.
"Responsive support team, easy interface, works great. No complaints, and great feedback. Works well for our store and does exactly what we need."
"I am sometimes hesitant to leave reviews for apps that I really like. There’s something to be said for knowing a well-kept secret. But S Loyalty is good enough that I can’t keep it secret.
We happily used another loyalty app for about 9 months. But I ultimately needed something with a) more visual and textual customization, b) more and better reward options, and c) a better customer interface. While I’m not a huge fan of popup / overlay windows, S Loyalty gave me all three of those, at a great price.
Notifications — An amazing array of options here. Popup windows and reminders abound, and all can be toggled on or off as you see fit. Email notifications are also available on the Silver plan or above, which means you can have email notices go to your customers for only $39/month. That’s far cheaper than any loyalty app I’ve seen.
Rewards — This was what originally drew me to S Loyalty. You can do percent off, percent off collection, dollars off with minimum purchase, dollars off specific items, and more. There’s really every possible kind of reward to be had with S Loyalty. 
Setup — Because S Loyalty is so customizable, there are a lot of decisions to make during setup. It’s only a few extra minutes, but be aware that you’ll have lots of control at your fingertips. I think the sweetest part is that they have a bookmarklet that allows the app to generate the necessary discount codes in Shopify in a single click. I have yet to run across anything that easy.
Interface — The basic customer interface on this is awesome. It’s slick, modern, clean, and pretty customizable for look and feel. It is a perfect fit for our site, and looks really pro. While the basic layout is locked down, there’s enough customization here that it looks like it would work on any site, any theme. The organization is really intuitive, and it makes it really easy—and really tempting—for customers to manage and cash in their rewards. 
Support — I used to be a developer, so when I install an app, I tend to bombard support teams with lots of detailed questions. Anthony and Nancy at S Loyalty handled all this with grace and aplomb. I couldn’t have asked for better help.
Our previous loyalty program was wildly successful, so I was a little unsure about how the new setup would affect customers. So far it has been great—within hours, we already have people cashing in their points through the S Loyalty interface. 
Loyalty programs are not for everyone—after all, you’ll end up giving away a lot of free stuff—but if you’ve been considering whether to install one on your store, you really need to look no further than S Loyalty."
"The app itself is fantastic. The best customer support app that I could find in the Shopify app store. It saved a lot of time, and the interface is user-friendly. 
I had some problem in installing and running the app, the customer support is excellent and quiet supportive.  
Please add more features by allowing automatic ticket support is assigning to customer support executives."
"Easy to configure, like the user interfaces, the settings are suitable for booking module for any session products."
"Reasonably simple to set up. 
I really like that we can designate the specific available appointment windows by hours, days and date. A much much easier interface for setting up and managing than BookThatApp, which we used for several years."
Very helpful team excellent customer service! We found the application an excellent marketing tool better than that of other competitors (more flexible and stronger over all features with a user friendly interface).
"Pros:
1. Very good concept, I consider it the best among the customer communication apps. It's convenient to manage all communications and manage orders from the same interface. 
2. The interface is clean, easy to navigate and find useful information.
3. Reasonably priced, has a very good beginner's deal.
4. Support is excellent, had a pleasant conversation, and they do listen to customers.
Cons:
The reason I did not give 5 star is this app seems unfinished, still need a lot of improvement to deliver what it promised: 
1. If your domain e-mail is not g-suite, you may have e-mail delivery issue for outgoing e-mails; I know there are ways to work around this, but it's complicated and not documented by Gorgias. 
2. Does not work nicely with contact forms, not able to hide contact form system information from customers .
3. Does not yet have a desktop app to work efficiently for LiveChat support. 
Overall, keep an eye on it, once this app gets mature, it will worth the money."
"It's a great app, support has been prompt and very helpful. It also has a great user interface. Very convenient to manage your vendors and sellers with. I fully recommend it."
"An excellent and easy to set up system. I like th interface. The 14 day trial period is just too short to get a feel if it will work. The problem is that you now have customers wiith an expectation of rewards - but we  believe it will work. I like the fact that you can go back and award poits to past customers. It would have been great if you could have sent them an immediate email saying that they have been awarded points.
We also received some free support frum the S loyatly team who made our widget look smarter and included our logo in the reward tab - great support and help - Thank you!
We have also advertised the programme in a newsletter to customers. We have seen an increase in our online  sales and believe it will continue,
For us it is now about leveraging the flexibility of the  loyalty points system to build a loyal buying customer base."
"Edit Order fills in a glaring Shopify omission: The ability to edit orders. Customers are bound to select multiple items one size and accidentally add one with a different size. (My former shop would flag such discrepancies in the checkout window.)
Edit Order does not flag discrepancies but it does allow you to contact a grateful customer and change line items on their invoice. Refunds and requests for additional funds are seamless handled through the Shopify interface. Customer service has been excellent.
----
My only complaints have nothing to do with the app, but rather how Shopify maintains its audit trail. Edits require the original order to be canceled and a new one created. Cleverific makes this process as transparent as possible; it can even adjust inventory.
The issue is that Shopify includes multiple sales in the customer history following an edit. If you edit a variant description without even touching the price on a $50 order, customer history will indicate 2 orders totaling $100 have been made. Need to make another edit? Now the customer has placed 3 orders totaling $150."
"Excellent customer support: fast, polite and very proactive. Has lots of templates, tutorials & tips. It would be good to be able to open full screen the app as at times is a little hard to work on the small interface. Other than that, it leaves within your shopify, which makes all the linking to products a breeze. Thank you guys!"
"I've used this app for a couple of years now and really love it. It's easy to use, and the interface let me create a design that was exactly what I was imagining! Customer support responded same day, and answered some questions I had recently. It's also priced as a great value. - Rod Moore, Leader, https://coolguitarshop.us"
"This app is fantastic! I wish I had it when I was working on a site 2 years ago! It starts off with a quick tutorial, then you're in... The interface is extremely intuitive and they are prompt to answer any questions you have. This should be something integrated into shopify for sure."
"It is a great app. they have a good free plan and great features, with a really nice interface. Recommended!"
"Detailed descriptions do not support editing pictures. Editing text content is updated synchronously, resulting in all original image data in the store being deleted, unable to recover, months of hard work in vain, and poor user experience."
"Very instinctive interface, the fact it's built-in within Shopify makes content creation super easy, great for beginners."
"I've tried a few bulk edit apps, but this is one fantastic piece of app. You wouldn't believe this was free. Full of features, the interface is slick and easy to use, and it has saved me a ton of time. Absolutely recommended"
"So far, awesome. I seriously struggled with creating newsletters until this app. So easy! And the user interface is just like the Shopify backend so it's not a whole new platform to learn. And it's free for a new biz like me! Perfect!"
"This is BY FAR the best auction app on the market. Auction Pro identified and adjusted to my ""vintage"" style theme seamlessly. The interface is easily navigable and very responsive. Seriously, within minutes you can have fully-functional auctions on your products. Registered customers can view previous bidders and set an automatic bid amount! Customers are also notified via email when they`ve been outbid. Auction Pro will speak for itself if you utilize the free trial. The statement ""priority customer support"" is without question a great understatement. My theme is WolfofShopify: an older theme with several translation errors resulting in a registration page without a first/last_name key. The Auction Pro app requires this information. I contacted support@enginelaser.com with the issue as described above. The Founder and Developer at EngineLaser responded to my email within hours. Our conversation made it clear I`d have to create html for a first/last_name field. I have absolutely no idea how to code. Jeffrey offered his assistance without hesitation. He inputted html to improve my website; ultimately, granting access to this incredible app within hours. A top-notch auction app with a customer-driven Founder and Developer. I`m sold! My sincere appreciation
Cheeky Breaks"
"Works well so far, easy to use interface."
"good as a free up it does the necessry things , it nedds mor work to simplify the interface a little"
All perfectly! Thanks! Everything works great! Very quickly set up and launched. The interface is very convenient.
Excellent app with a clear and intuitive interface and amazing support should you need it. Would recommend though prefer that our competitors didn't know about it of course.
Whatsapp used for basic enquiries customers have. It is a good tool for communication as the interface is easy to operate.
interface 4 spent ***** *** hours very **** :D :D :D :D hard use to This exactly what you will get from user interface :D you will understand nothing very hard to setup may be good application but the stupidest interface I have ever met since 10 years working in digital marketing
good app easy to use and its free interface is easy to customise and have enough elements to edit so good enough
The app has good features but the user interface is hard to understand. It needs to look cleaner and clear.
I cant change the number and it automatically inserts my personal one. I don't understand what exactly i have to insert. user interface is too messy.
"User interface is horrendous. Very difficult to navigate and actually understand what you are setting up. Descriptions in English are poorly written. They have also plastered callouts about their app all over the setup screen, such as ""NO XYZ.COM"". I wanted to like this app, but no, it did not work for me."
Simple and functional. no ads and good experience. nice interface and high level o customization. Recommended.
"Too much spam!
The app looks like a page where 5 pop-ups could open at any moment.
Please rework your interface!"
"Gostei da funcionalidade porém a interface do App não me agradou, além do monte de propaganda e pedidos para serem avaliados."
"Great customisation options, nice interface. Would be good to control which pages it shows on but aside from that, good stuff!"
"This app was ok, the user interface is really poor though and really horrible organised. Also, I would like to cancel the recurring subscription charges. I tried contacting customer support but no one replied for ages...."
We integrated whatsapp chat using this. Its smooth and wonderful. We would be experimenting with their other features. The User interface is not clean and is confusing. They can surely work on it and remove the unwanted and non working stuff from there.
"this app looks amazing , simple to use and verry interface friendly.
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
"Mostly easy to use interface, save button is in bottom right :) They also have support available if needed - all free!"
"App easy to install and to use. 
Filters are great. Are you thinking of adding price range filter? (maybe it already is added and I missed it). 
Nikita was super helpful and reactive on our first requests to personnalize the filters for our store interface."
"Hi, I am trying different filters and seeing what they are like. The interface for this one is nice, but it doesn't seem to support different filters per collection, which is a requirement if you have different product ranges.
It also requires some manual setup, with more work this will be a good app I think."
"Nice and easy ,did the job, save time , good interface , reasonable price , help busy admins, Thanks"
"I'm not sure where to begin... 
The app itself is pretty good. Easy to import new products as well as connecting old products to new suppliers. The SMAR7 Express app plays a key role in my day-to-day operations, the interface is clean.. easy to find products, check the original listings, etc. 
Straight forward fulfillment process, imports all of your customer information.. the only thing you need to do is confirm and pay. Once you've purchased the item, you can easily sync the order and tracking IDs. I was using Expressify in the past but like this one much more.. SMAR7 Apps does a great job on educating its users on not only how to use the apps, but how to maximize its use.
They take it a step further, helping users learn how to drive traffic, market their products, etc. Our success is their success, and I can see that in how they treat us like partners.
I haven't had any issues resulting in me needing to contact support but you can tell by the way the SMAR7 Apps team manages their Facebook page that they have a solid support system. They are very customer oriented and go out of their way to make sure you have the tools, and the know-how, you need to succeed. 
Without SMAR7 Apps, I wouldn't be anywhere near where I am today!"
"The search feature on our site was revamped with suggestions and more filters that make the user experience a lot better. The support has been awesome, we received help to make this app fit better on our store. Thank you!"
"I want to give this app 5 stars as the value is great, the layouts are fantastic and definitely a must have if you want to get away from Shopify's boring ""free"" templates. But I do have a few things that I've noticed: Numerous spelling errors on the app interface, Can't add submenu's on some of the design blocks, Can't add hyperlinks (unless I'm missing something??)"
This is an easy to use app and beautiful interface.  I'm glad its a free app and i hope it stays this way :)
"Super easy to implement and it looks great! The user experience is very slick, and the sentences collapse down form a menu."
"So far so go. Love the ""Shopify"" style interface. This makes it easy to navigate once you first start. I had an issue that was quickly resolved. This issue was something I did on my end. Maria did a great job explaining why I was incorrect and how to correct future layouts. She even included snapshots of where to find it. Great job LayoutHub."
super appli vraiment utile. Decouvert par hasard. simple d'utilisation et belle interface. ravi pour ma boutique
Lots of power with a friendly interface. Had it up and operating in just a few minutes.
i used this app first time and it works well. thank you for easy interface. I suggest to go with this. thank you very much.
Ive used many affiliate apps and this one is super good.  Very easy interface and easy to set up.  Support is quick to set up and get started.  The information is clear
"This app looks absolutely perfect. The interface similar to that of Shopify makes navigation very convenient. There are a large number of possibilities, everything is very well thought out. I'm almost done setting up and can't wait to use it. Everything looks very reliable. Documentation and tutorials allow you to configure everything on your own, everything is very well explained.
Only downside: the integration of the domain name for emails, which requires outside help despite the different supports (Growthero & Sendgrid). It would take a DNS expert within Growthero support, able to add the elements to the Shopify backoffice.
For the rest, everything is perfect, this application is a marvel and the support is fantastic, always available, open to improvements. A big thank you to the team and especially to Simon for his availability and his professionalism.
This application is recent but is already very advanced technically. Chances are it will become the best for affiliate programs."
It was a real task to find the right brand ambassador program. Happy with my decision to go with Growth Hero. Easy to customize interface and Simon from support is incredible. Literally replies within 5 minutes with a great response to any question. Would recommend.
Great user interface. Has all the features you need to get an affiliate program started quickly. Highly recommend
"I was looking for an app to bundles several of my existing products into one product to sell. I kept looking around for long time as there are not many available in the app store, I can say MBC should be the only one offering the bundling function together with inventory management of individual products within the bundle. Very easy to use interface, works with Ajax cart (with backend modification) and most importantly very prompt and reliable support.
I had an issue with the layout of the bundle product page, these guys are responsive, kept trying to resolve the problem and of course, succeed eventually. 
Highly recommend this app and this company."
"I am using this app for my book website and I must say it is great. Although it is not a beginner's user interface, if you take some time then you will learn the ropes and get used to it. I think it is better than the others, ultimately. There seems to be more to offer."
"Very happy with Privy, been using the app for 6+ months, initially only got the Convert plan (pop ups etc) and just upgraded to + Email, migrating from Mailchimp. The app is great, they really do get Shopify users, the interface is really easy to use, the ready made ""recipes"" are great. Just a single pop up campaign has become my main source of email collection and very happy with the results. The support is also great, special shoutout to Amynata who is the Queen of Support, has an answer for everything, finds a solution to every problem. My main reason for upgrading to email was that I wanted a solution for abandoned carts that would create unique discount codes for each email sent out so that they could each expire after X days / hours to create urgency. They have this solution, and doing it with Mailchimp would have meant working with another app on top of the one already needed for the shopify integration, and Klavyo wasn't convincing. I would have given it 5 stars, but the only reason I can't do that right now is because of some small shortcomings, like the free shipping bar campaign clashing with my sticky nav, which they're working on, and some other email features I miss from Mailchimp but I have full trust this new and younger company will do things better and release new features continuously that are truly optimised for Shopify users. Overall super happy. Also their content is REALLY GREAT, would totally advise subscribing to their newsletters."
"The best affiliate marketing app I could find. Super easy to set up, easy interface for affiliates. Great customer service."
"We have several of Bold's apps on our new store. So far, we have been very pleased with all the products. The store locator is easy to use and find it useful for those who dont wish to purchase online. The sales motivator is just that and the user interface (customer) is pleasant and easy to update/modify on the user interface (store side). Customer service has been really responsive and helpful with our many concerns/questions. To summarize, we would definitely suggest Bold apps to any other store that is setting up or needs a little boost in their product sales."
Im really happy I found this app! I have just launched it and the user interface is so smooth easy to understand and most importantly MY EMAILS DO NOT GO TO SPAM!
"A little confusing to navigate the interface but we have been able to create a usable, easily updatable find a retailer page, which our stores appreciate."
"We have been a customer with Shiprocket since 5 months and the service provided by my account manager Ayushi Gupta is commendable. She has helped us with all our queries seamlessly. She has always helped us in everyone issue that we face. All over shiprocket's response to queries , the website and app interface are all very user friendly and good. Would definitely recommend shiprocket to anyone who is looking for shipping facility for  their business."
"Overall I would like to give shiprocket 3 stars. The reason is there user interface is not that good. Also, there are many things they need to work on. I gave 1 extra star for my account manager Aman Grover. He has been very helpful and patiently explaining everything to us. I will update my review if shiprocket improve there user interface. Otherwsie I am satisfied with overall performance."
"Privy is going to help me with email marketing, with its easy to use interface I believe it will be highly effective. All you do is drag, drop, and fill in the spaces. It does not slow down your website and is a wonderful app a must-have"
The backend user interface of the app is friendly and the options are easy to set up.We wrote in on a couple of issues and they were all solved quickly by the team! Everything works great. Thank you!
"shipping fees are reasonable, interface is easy to use and good support as well from my account manager. thank you"
Good rates and a very good software interface. Does the job smoothly. The option of couriers and support of RM is nice although they don't provide a direct number to contact.
Simple user interface. Great for startups and a very dedicated support team for technical and other support. Very timely assistance from our R.M. Anuj Tripathi of Shiprocket.
Shiprocket has been easy to use the user interface is excellent. Support has always been extremely responsive. Especially our account manager Varun he is there to help us always and solve the queries evertime. Thank you
Way too difficult to use. App takes you out of the Shopify interface and forces you to use their UI. Poorly designed and convoluted.
Shiprocket has been easy to use the user interface is excellent. Support has always been extremely responsive. Especially our account manager Sanjeev he is there to help us anytime. Thank you
"I am using shopify to schedule my Amazon & shopify orders since Feb2019 and I can tell you that this is one of the best shipping app available in  India.
It has a very simple user interface yet a very powerful system. If you are delivering 800+ orders per month then you can get an exclusive account manager and it saves you a lot of time and energy.
Thank You Shiprocket Team"
Great app. I like the intuitive interface and great features. I would highly recommend this app to others
This variant option is the best app for custom products! The interface is very user-friendly and whatever customization you might need is there! (so far as we use it) The technical support is very quick to respond and help you with queries and requests. Highly recommended!
"So far so good. There interface design is bulky, and there are a few notices obstructing the experience. Beyond that the app seems to be doing what it promises."
"Inexpensive and gets the job done. The user interface is a little bulky and old-fashioned, but it works.
Edited to respond to developer response: I would update to a more modern UI framework that's cleaner and easier to navigate. Material UI is elegant and most people are used to seeing it. It makes navigation and elements much easier to find. https://material-ui.com/"
"This app is awesome!Very easy to use, interface is clear and options self explanatory. Robust features, leaves little to be desired. Extremely friendly and helpful support staff. Would use again!"
"Great app !!!! Works perfectly. Great support, intuitive interface. Convenient and simple to use.Highly recommend using it !!!!"
SMS bump chat help is perfect ! I'm gonna test how it can help my business. Interface is very user friendly
"Been using this app for the past year & really enjoyed the easy interface & the numerous features I didn't even know we need. Very handy for slimming down your site & fixing meta tags, title & descriptions. A great value. Thank you!"
It's pretty good. I like the option. I wish the interface was more user friendly. Most of our customers are on mobile so I am hoping there is a mobile feature.
"There are a lot of features with this app. So many in fact, that it's getting very difficult to find items. The interface is not super intuitive and it's glitchy. 
That said, it does what it says it'll do. Our popups have been successful thus far, but the time it takes to create a new campaign, one that actually looks good and has no glitches or formatting issues once published, is not worth it for us to pay for any aspect of the plan. 
I recommend JustUno revisits their campaign builder's UX and that they onboard every customer - - even free ones (via live webinar is fine)."
absolutely worst customer service and apps interface. no responsibility displayed by the companies emplyees
"Amazing app, incredible features, simple to use, great navigation, user experience and interface. Recommended."
"Pros: Cutting edge tech app; Well integrated User friendly interface; Logistic charges are not too high; Daily pickups.
Cons: Low manpower->slow response and action; High no. of weight discrepancies on even freezed SKUs; insufficient client support on FAKE ATTEMPTS."
"I needed a simple to use photo editing App to replace the Shopify plug in that stopped working. I tried a few Apps before this one but they were either too complicated for my needs or did not provide what I was looking for. However this App does everything I wanted and lots more too all wrapped up in an easy to use interface.
I am currently testing the free version but fully expect to take advantage of the paid option soon. Highly recommended.
BlackMike Models"
Very friendly professional service felt like family. Highly recommend and their interface is very user friendly
Great tool for collecting contacts.  Clean interface with useful and very customizable templates.  Highly recommend
Overall a very good interface and reliable account managers. Faced some delivery delays but received assistance to resolve the issue.
The app interface is really easy to use and the wizard helps create new promotions by taking all the guesswork out of it.  Really easy for someone who is busy trying to run other parts of the business.
"Very nice services, I am using shiprocket from past one year.Attractive shipping rate, Nice interface, All courier partners at one place. Very impressed with Customer success team in resolution of queries and providing direct support promptly. Please keep it up."
I used this app to help me build me email marketing list. The tools are easy to use and the interface is setup so even a novice can create a campaign!
Love JustUno and its ability to convert prospects to leads. I have significantly increased my email list conversions because of it. Sometimes I do wish the user interface was easier...but I don't mind hiring someone to help figure out the hidden powers of it on my behalf!
"Just started setting up the app but so far I like how it works and look forward to seeing some more results! The interface could use a little bit more work and I'd love a live chat option to get help in real time but other than that, it seems to be a great lead capture app."
SO FAR SO GOOD. INTERFACE COULD BE BETTER DONE. I WOULD RECOMMEND TO A FRIEND. FREE VERSION IS LIMITED BUT ENOUGH FOR NOW I GUESS.
"Interface is quite user friendly. Really easy to get started, especially with the templates, they give you a pretty good idea of how to make a pop ups."
"Used in a few years ago, now I am back, missed them! Very user friendly interface and stable, not overloaded with features that its mind-numbing to try creative things easily."
"J'utilise sendcloud depuis plus d'un an. Tout se passe bien, l'interface est claire et facile à utiliser. Le service client a toujours été rapide et efficace.
Je recommande"
"Excellente App. Très complète pour l'envoi de colis. L'interface avec la boutique Shopify est bien faite même si parfois certains paramètre sont difficile à trouver (mais l'équipe SendCloud a été toujours là pour m'aider rapidement - chouette système de tickets pour l'assistance d'ailleurs).
Je recommande chaleureusement."
"Really easy design interface with tons of templates to quickly get you started. The only aspect that took me a bit of time to figure out was programming the coupons, but other than that it's a simple yet powerful app."
Super easy to use and great interface
"Very useful app, our orders are shipped faster than ever!
We like it because is very simple to use, and for it's very clean interface."
"Very happy in the beginning. Till I realized all my Customer dashboards are showing wrong shipping information to my Customer. By ""all"" I mean for at least all my latest 60 orders. I started receiving Customer complaints. The shipping dates shown to my Customer on the sendcloud dashboard, were 3 weeks ahead of the actual shipping dates!! 
I contacted the Customer Service and they explained this is a known bug, and this can only be fixed for the future orders. I had just to deactivate and activate a page to fix it. As a Customer I expect if there is a known bug in the system, I will be informed asap of such bug. Is it so difficult to inform via Newsletter all your Customers about this problem? If sendcloud can´t do his basic job (showing shipping information to the Customer) and is not able to inform his Customers about this, the app is not worth the price. 
I understand bugs can happen, but not informing your Customers about it to be able to fix it, is just unacceptable. 
Please, KEEP YOUR CUSTOMERS UPDATED ON ANY BUGS AND REQUIRED ACTIONS to avoid such bad user experiences like mine. 
Therefore 1 star review."
"As a technical service provider we recommend to use Sendcloud. 
For us, the connection to shopify was very intuitive and offers us many possibilities. 
On the other hand, the tool offers our customers a nice user interface in which even technically inexperienced people can find their way around immediately. 
I can only recommend Sendcloud to anyone who is looking for a tool to help them process their online orders."
"The interface is a little clunky and confusing at first, but it seems to be an effective tool."
"Super simple and intuitive interface. Have pop ups built, integrated and active in a matter of minutes!"
I am using Privy to help maintain proper communication with my customers and so far I like how simple its interface is.
"As of today, we love the app. Easy to use and the design interface is well done!"
Downloaded for popup newsletter signup. Works great so far but still early. Interface is easy to use. No issues.
super slick app I dig it. really nice interface
"Loved it!  Its very easy to use, and interfaces well with my website."
"Great app, but as for me. I think their interface is a little complicated to use."
"First test done : very easy to manage, cool interface. I hope now to capture plenty of emails with my first campaign."
"A great user interface, makes it very easy to add Aliexpress products to your store. Also there is brilliant customer service."
Best shipping tool and incredible service :-) great interface and the Pack&Go is a great tool! Thank you!
Really amazing products!! Good descriptions on products. Good support chat/Good interface. good fotos highly recommend this app.
Really amazing products!! Good descriptions on products. Good support chat/. Good interface. good fotos.
"At greatbritishgarden.de we are very happy to have found Sendcloud. Brilliant interface, super ciustomer service and very competitive pricing. Absolutely recommended!! Thanks"
What I like about this app is that it has an extremely intuitive interface. So easy to deal with and great selection of products.
"einfach klasse das tool, macht was es soll und das sehr gut...
super einfach zu bedienen und jetzt mit dem neuen interface noch besser als vorher...danke!!"
"Great app, easy to install and setup. Import function is very easy, and the interface looks great. Thank you"
"I cant really leave a useful review since I am being forced to at this point with very little exposure to what this app can actually do. This is literally mid-publish.
The interface is very clean and easy to use."
"Great Free App, but the user interface is bit complex.
Overall Must Have!!"
"Great app - relatively easy integration, and excellent interface. This is a feature we were scrimping and saving to integrate for years! So glad to have access off the shelf."
"Mission critical app.  Sometimes it's a little kludgy, And I think the interface could be better, but it WORKS very well.  And the support is stellar... always there to fix and help."
It looks fine on the site. It is very easy to install and has a useful interface. thanks. perfect...
"I used this app to add a waitlist button to my store, once installed the customer service was fast and easy to understand. They helped me navigate the interface of the app so I could customise to suit my store. Very important!"
"The installation took considerably less time than we expected, despite our theme being non-standard and significantly reworked. The support team reacted swiftly and was really friendly. The app interface is intuitive and requires no effort to adjust. We definitely can recommend this app as a must-have to every store."
"The app is a great addition to our site.  Cheryl in particular has been a huge help.  She's not only responsive, but helpful in making suggestions and providing ideas to improve our user experience."
A great app that i love to use and great user interface but since Jun 16 they limit to 50 reviews for free account. Disappointed to know that i have to pay even I just need the basic features of customer leaving rating and just publishing it. Will look for other free alternative apps.
Does what it's supposed to in an easy to use interface. The free plan works fine for a simple feed and customizations with an upgrade.
The interface and functions are very simple. Works perfectly. I would recommend using this app. Thanks!
"Quick, responsive & efficient customer service. Easy to use user interface + custom features can be translated upon request. Thank you!"
Hello! I had some issues to set the switcher position on my desing to make it responsive on mobile devices. Max from the customer service connected to my account within the same day I wrote them and provided me solutions. He addapted the the position switcher for mobile devices to my design and I'm supper happy with the results! I did not start translating yet but the interface looks super friendly and easy to use. Also I really like the fact that you can slowly translate your site and check the results via URL before publishing the language in your site. Overall...super happy so far.
"I really like this app and does what it’s supposed to do. Easy to maneuver on the back end and very professional looking on the front end. But there should be a way for users to utilize the function while the app developer works on any updates. The app disappears on the front end when the app developer is making updates. It happened enough times for me to notice. I expect this from a free app, not a premium one. 
Hopefully, the app developer works on that to make it an even better user experience on the back end and front end."
easy to use. custom language interface and emails. Highly customizable in anything you might think of. Supoort is quick to respond. easy to use and not too complicated. easy to setup as well.
Great for filtering products across the store although I would say the user experience could be improved as I was unclear on the set up steps. Having said that the support team were extremely helpful!
"Super app d'affiliation en plus multilingue ! Je recommande fortement.
En plus interface ergonomique"
"Very good professional app, very nice and helpful support. Interface also is good and understandable."
The support team is very helpful and responsive. We find the features effective and great especially for intuitive and user-friendly store interface.
"I am still new to the app & haven't seen all of what this app can do. So far they make integration & setup very easy. The interface is user-friendly & easy to set up. So far, so good."
"The app interface is user-friendly. Had a few issues, but support came through......................."
"J'ai beaucoup hésité à choisir une app pour faire de l'affiliation sur mon site et je suis très content de Goaffpro, l'appli est en Anglais mais on peut configurer l'interface client en français donc c'est top. La configuration est simple à conditions de se débrouiller avec l'anglais. Bref je recommande pour les sites français !"
I use this app for dropship suppliers because it offers so many options for products made in the US. The team at DropCommerce are very helpful and easy to contact and go above and beyond. The interface is simple and easy to use and importing products is simple. Love it all so far!
"Fantastic app, great support whenever you need it as well. A must-have for any store with a larger inventory or smaller inventory, but would like to improve the functionality of their product catalog and user experience."
"We are a supplier for the growing DropCommerce network.
Much needed development for the sellers looking for products shipping from the US.
Shipping from the US means faster shipping, higher quality products and more return customers to your store!
Support walked us through the every process. System has a very easy set up and clean interface."
"(+): App support is very responsive. App provider also interfaces quickly with vendors if needed. Many nice US made products from small batch suppliers. Product invoicing options from some vendors. large selection of items. (-)So far, not all the vendors featured in the few orders I've done have been prompt, but is a limited sample. But for one instance waited almost a week for paid order to get shipped--and still waiting on the product. Likely will be 10 days or more and was a simple stock item of detergent. In another instance waited a few days because the payment wouldn't go through. Margins lower than typical. Some vendors demand minimum pricing. Shipping cost arrangement a  bit of a surprise once I started ordering, but it will just ensure I don't go over the max orders per month when the shipping reimbursement stops, or it won't be worth it due to the high and unpublished shipping costs from some vendors. Also, the fulfillment process is a little klunky and does not fire off a fulfillment trigger to Loox nor to Judge.me for reviews for some reason but it is hard to say where that issue lies...but the non-Drop Commerce orders work fine. Though Klaviyx does pick up the events, so there is a workaround but it means two different flows in my campaigns.  Also imports variants incorrectly, but the support folks have been very open to fixing it in a future release, which would be nice. It is not a showstopper but requires handjamming the changes on every imported product.  So overall, a 4.5 rounded up because the staff is responsive and friendly and there are unique nice products worth checking out. Not sure if I'll keep but definitely worth a try to see what you think."
Excellent interface and very easy to set up!
We needed a well-designed product filter that can deliver a friendly UX. Great customer services and sleek interface. Recommended!
"Have recently installed and haven't used much of its features.
After a period of time i will be in a position to give full review of the usage.
Till now every thing looks perfect with easy to use features and clean interface.
This is my first experience using such an app so was trying to know how my i can make my influencers can have it convenient to use.
Don't have much to say at this instance"
"Less then 2 hours in. Will update review. So far, user friendly. Good app.
I email Sunday late night, get replied Monday morning. Say's it all.
Great app so far. Really user friendly interface with many options. Easy to understand. 
Looking for a FAQ by the way, they have an good app for that also. ;)"
"Ive only been using this app for literally 32 hours, but I can see the robustness and power behind its simple interface.  I only wish there was a way to have a direct link to a sign up page instead of a small pop up tab.  Id like for my customers to be able to see the page directly, but incognito has its up sides as well"
"Wow. It set up really easy. It's kind of perfect. I don't have any experience using it except to set up and test which only took about 15 minutes, but wow, so easy to set up, and I love the interface."
"Here's my story with GoAffPro — I first installed this app when I had created my very first store 2 years ago. They did exactly what I needed and offered me just enough access to tools and set up with the free version that it helped me to not get too overwhelmed. (since this was my first time attempting affiliate marketing) Jump 2 years to today and I now have more experience than when I first started out so, naturally, I wanted to create a new store. As I created my brand new store, Mycloset.clothing, the very first app I installed was GoAffPro. Since my last time using them was 2 years ago I definitely was able to see all the improvements they made and even what they improved for the free version. The user interface is easy to use (I would only request that when you are in the admin dashboard that maybe instead of bolding the setting tab you are on, maybe adding some tab highlight too so it stands out more?), they make setting up the commission, payments, and design a walk in the park, offering you just what you need, and even what you might not have thought you needed, easy to access on your admin dash. I'm still using the free version since my affiliate program is new and I haven't started growing that network yet, but knowing that I have everything in place and a good foundation to build on with easy to see profit tabs and even a creatives section for affiliates, makes me feel a lot more confident in taking that next step. And last but not least, the customer service is spot on. I made a silly technical error, put in a ticket late night on the weekend, and by early next morning, Anuj answered my question and even fixed my issue with one reply! Thank you GoAffPro for offering a free version of your app with enough features to let store owners test it out and even run on it smoothly. P.S. if you're wondering about payment handling - GoAffPro takes care of that for you and even offers a plethora of different payment options, if you're just starting out - you can't go wrong with these guys."
I love the test feature that shows me the kind of user experience the affiliates are going to have!
really nice products n clean interface. found products I liked right away! i like how I can see all the suppliers in a list.
"I've installed this app this evening.
Very nicely developed - clean interface, many customisabe options and straight-forward to use. 
Hopefully I'll see noticeable differences over time. 
Thank you to the developers for allowing this to be free for the smaller businesses out there!"
Great App! Great walkthroughs to set up! I would recommend this to everyon. Very simple interface. Woo
"Absolutely love this app! I can't recommend it more, literally, everything is customizable and my affiliates love the interface! Can't ask for more!"
Such a great user interface!  Simple and to the point.  Very easy way to drive repeat sales.
Just set it up. So far so good . Friendly user interface and quick set up. Will update my review in some days.
"I love this app, it's easy to set up and support my store language
and can customize interface with a few click
Thank you"
"It is amazing! Makes Email marketing much easier. Easy to use and fun interface. I was struggling with email marketing as a new drop shipper, but this made it fun. Keep up the great work! Thank you!"
Nice interface but not for us. We are a little bit disappointed as once deleted the scroll down is still present on our website.
I've just installed this app recently and I love it so far! The user interface is beautiful and I love that in free option have abandon cart push included compared to other apps that have abandon cart push only in paid option! So far so good! Recommended
I just sent my first email to subscribers.  I like the interface - it was easy to set up and I like that its free if you only have less that 100 subscribers!
Great app! Easy to set up with guided instructions. Love the user interface. Definitely recommend it!
Clean interface and easy to install
"Do not hesitate if you are looking for the best translation app. We had a few issues with backend translations and after struggling a bit, we asked tech support for some assistance. Max solved it immediately. The interface is excellent, very simple and intuitive to use. After trying several apps, this one just worked. I would not hesitate to recommend it."
"Possibly the best marketing, cart recovery app available. I love all of its easy to use functions and its user friendly interface."
"Fantastic app!. Great interface, very simple to use. Especially if you, like me, prefer to do your translations manually. The support team is also excellent. They helped me out with the setup of the app. Highly recommended!."
"I used this app to add French to my store. Most of the translations were pretty accurate, but I had to tweak some of them to sound more authentic French, rather than just literal word to word translations. I like how there is a Rich Text and a code edit option, it gives me the power to make those tiny adjustments myself. I do wish the interface was more adaptable to my website, i.e. currently if you have to make some changes to a section on your page, you have to figure out where that section is on Shopify and there is a lot of options for that. It gets hard to find the exact page you want to translate sometimes. But the service that they provide is amazing. I had to change the color of the language switcher and adjust its position on my website to suit my theme, the support team made the changes in no time. Keep up the good work. I hope to see improvements in future. Cheers!"
"User friendly, nice interface."
"Intuitive interface and good documentation make installation easy.  There is bit of back and forth with the bulk discount creation, but nothing too onerous.  Popups and customer portals are customisable and look pretty good.  Will update after I see the results."
"It´s a great App , it works very well and you can personalize the fonts, colors and your brand logo, witch is great.
It is also matching the emails that you have already in your list to not have any duplicated.
The interface of the app is super easy to work with and the analytics are simple and have all the information that you need. Totally recommend this App to everyone that want to increase clients list and also sales. Thank you CrazyRocket"
"app working fine, nice interface and design with really good and in time support, best game app ever for shopify store"
"i'm using the app for email marketing, the interface is easy to use, customer service is very helpful"
So far so good. Very simple to set up. And easy for online customers to use. The POS interface is a little cumbersome. That may be the only drawback
"Great app in my opinion. great prices, fast printing , fast delivery. now they offer better shipping to uk and Canada also. this is a big plus! I had some minor problems in the past but support is a++ and resolved it in under 1 hour. on top of that, the interface is easy to use. plenty of products to choose from. Also , again imo , the designer tool could get a little upgrade to make our life a little better. i also hope they will add an api soon!"
"Very good customer service, they respond quickly. they helped me with app making also and good user interface app"
Awesome! The support is top-notch and the user experience is friendly. Would definitely recommend it. Great experience with Tidio.
Great chat app. Lots of chatbot and automation functionality. Interface is great and set up was easy. Would highly recommend!
"This app is exactly what I needed to give us a more professional feel and look to our customers..
The setup was an ease and we breezed through it.. the ui and interface is beautiful and a lot of options are given to customize the interface on our website to match it's theme..
the app is very responsive to users visiting and messaging through this platform..
I have nothing negative to say about this app as it has lived up to it's reputation..
Also it's very affordable for small business at the moment.."
"Edit - A tidio employee had contacted me about the confusion, and it turns out that we had just been forwarded emails we were not supposed to see. Now with the actual review, Tidio is a really good app. Although a tad higher priced, it has tons of features for sites to use, as well as a really nice interface for every feature! If they change to interaction based payments instead of visitor views, I will definitely repurchase!"
"Really good app. You can import and review all the reviews from AliExpress. Very customizable and nice interface, easy to use. It was better before the update tho, where you were able to hide the publishing date. Above this. I recomand it, as it has multiple amazing features and it's totally free!"
Great support and tool for the price. The interface is user friendly and well made. I totally recommend!
App looks useful. Interface seems intuitive. Still trying to set up. Support was very friendly and responsive. Great service.
Makes search engine optimization foolproof. Great user interface and solid recommendations as far as what would properly optimize my store.
"Very easy to install, a beautiful interface that is easy to use. An essential communication tool to create valuable relationships with potential customers."
"As a new ecommerce business owner, I loved how straight forward and use-friendly this app is! They guide you through all of the relevant information and give you great tips for improving user experience on your website. I love it!"
"Excellent interface and options. The dahsboard looks clean and easy to operate. I really like that everything is highly customizable, which is a great feature. Fantastic support by the developers. I am very pleased with everything so far!"
"We are using Tidio so that we can reply to any queries that customers may have in real time. That's what we wanted, that's what it does! We're finding that this is really popular and encourages sales by meeting any doubts customers might have. It was really easy to set up and is very flexible to configure so that it complements our website design very attractively. The dashboard interface is very intuitive to use. There seems to lots of other useful features to explore so we're minded to do that, as its all been good so far."
This app is really easy to set up and I am happy that they have a free tier. They also have a simple interface for customizing the way it looks and the review cards look pretty decent right out of the box.
"Really good app and the translations are very accurate, i love how it works overall and the app has a friendly interface and hence why is suitable for new uers"
je viens de payer votre application et je ne comprends rien de la configuration de cette application... j'aimerai avoir un remboursement parce ce que je n'ai même pas utiliser. l'interface est très difficile en configurer...veuillez me rembourser svp. cordialement
"Currently, I am using the free plan and it has been great, and the fact that I can use their mobile app to chat live with customers is a plus. Their user interface is easy to follow and set up, so you will be up & running in no time. I have contacted customer service once (after hours) for a general question about their plans, and I received a reply in just a few hours after sending. I will be sure to post more reviews as I gain more usage an experience with this app."
A nice app with friendly interface and good support. We had some problems with configuring the translation but Transcy's support team provided prompt assistance and helped us a lot
good and easy to use. maybe some edit and rearrange options would make it perfect to use for my store. other than that no complaints looks good and has good User Interface options
This app are really easy to deal with. The interface are nice and its very easy to customize the setting!
"although this app did not suit my needs, i must say that they have amazing customer support. overall easy to use interface, but had some issues with currency and language converters working in tandem, was a bit buggy."
"This app works great and is a HUGE time saver for our Shopify and Etsy stores. Logical interface, short learning curve and fantastic customer service when I did have a question."
"It's a good alternative to Mailchimp since it's readily available in the interface. For beginners it's a great tool, but has some limitations for those that are used to a more robust tool. It's superb for setting up a quick email, integrating products, and looking professional on a smaller budget. However, things such as name tags (inability to include), true reporting (inability to view click reporting, open rates, compare/contrast emails, subject line. A/B testing, etc), custom templates (inability to add your own HTML/CSS templates), etc. are lacking. I'm hopeful they'll come up with more reporting and customization as they continue to grow. Customer support is always very helpful."
"I tried every single filter / search app on Shopify that had 4.5 to 5 Stars before finally stumbling upon these guys... God how I wish they were the first app I tried. Brilliant effortless user interface, amazing filter/search tools, and a customer service team full of superstars. None of the other apps would respond to my ""live chat"" messages and most didn't even have any customer support at all... I felt like I was going crazy. I'm so grateful I found these guys, their customer care is spectacular. These guys take customer service to a whole new universe. I've never experienced anything like it. Absolutely amazing. I feel bad for anyone that tries to use another search/filter tool. I'd give 10 stars if I could. I know you'll be as stoked on this app as I am!"
Used it to setup layered navigation. Great app. User friendly interface. Great and responsive support! 5 stars!
One of the most intuitive user experiences in an app i have ever seen. Editing orders was never so easy. was blown away by the simplicity of it
"As a startup, email marketing is new (and scary) to us, we tried so many platforms and we can tell Seguno is what we feel is best built and structured.
The interface is easy to use and navigate
The drag and drop email composer is the best we tried so far.
Templates are nice
Pricing is fair.
We hope we can see email collection pop up, and replicate the website font.
Overall, very satisfied as a new user, yet to launch our first campaign so fingers crossed."
"Any app has it's pros and cons. What makes the whole difference between a satisfied customer and a steaming customer is support.  I have experienced Thimatic support first hand, and they are second to none.  Hands down a great app with a very user-friendly interface does what it's supposed to do flawlessly.   Most important is that if it doesn't and you need help, it's there and it's very responsive.  I recommend this app for any business that requires bundling items or creating a product out of several items."
"This app is amazing!!! We were doing manual tag edits, but as our sku count grew, we needed to speed up the process quickly. This app has solved that problem very effectively, and saved us days of time by doing these in bulk. Bonus: the screen interface is beautifully designed and intuitive to use, and the customer service is A++++!!!
We've only used the tag edits so far, and are excited to start using all the great features of this product. Thanks Vela for making this super great app!!!"
"I installed this app because, at the time, my email was down so I couldn't bulk download products in spreadsheet form and re-upload it to make mass changes. In summary, this app does everything right, but it's too slow. 
This app is free, so I give it a pass. But if it was paid, I would ask for a refund. The interface is solid. It couldn't be more straightforward. The design is great and you can edit everything you would ever need to edit en mass. However, there is a huge drawback. 
This app took nearly an entire day to make a simple price change on my products. Granted, it was 5400+ products, but still... If my email were not down at the time, I could have downloaded a spreadsheet of my products from Shopify, made the changes in excel, and re-uploaded it all within 15 minutes. 
I have no Shopify app dev knowledge so I don't know if it is their fault how slow it is. And I can see how an app might have a ton of limitations when compared to a native bulk CSV upload. So devs, if you're reading this, I am not blaming you. 
At the end of the day, it is a good app to have. Especially because it is free. But if you are thinking about installing this, ask yourself a few questions:
1. Do you understand how to make bulk edits with CSV files? If so, and you have access to it, you don't really need to install this. But if that is you, you already know that. On the other hand, if spreadsheets intimidate you, install this app. 
2. Do you have time to spare? Is it okay if the edits aren't published for a few hours? If so, use this app. If time is of the essence, don't bother. Make CSV edits. 
3. Do you need something to make simple, non-essential changes without messing with CSV files and potentially making a mistake? Definitely download this app. 
It's a great app. And it's free. It's just slow. Despite the speed issues, I will keep this app. I don't like making edits to bulky CSV files for minor, inconvenient changes. I will continue to use this app for that single purpose. However, if the changes I need to make need to happen quickly, CSV it is."
Great app and the best part is that it is ease to use and build similar to shopify interface
This app has been great for our collection pages to really speed up the load and user experience. Support has been great helping us with some customizations to make it work with our theme.
"Fabulous app!  I have been with Vela since the beginning in beta/test mode, and it keeps getting better and better.  Excellent features, nicely organized interface, and superior customer service.  A MUST!"
A great app for store owners. Definitely helps to minimize the work load while giving customers a great user experience.
"Do not use this app. Just use the free Shopify Email app instead, because:
1) It randomly loses my progress when I'm working on an email campaign. You have to manually save every 5 min. Are we back in 90s now?
2) Buggy user interface all around.
3) Rude and unhelpful support. I'm a web developer. I know how easily some of these bugs can be fixed, especially for a big company like theirs. The support person always ignores my suggestions and blames me for their lack of best practices.
4) Shopify Email is free and has most of the same features you need. I have 2000+ contacts that I send emails out on a regular basis. This app has been incredibly difficult to work with. I really tried to work with Automizely for weeks, because only they had the features I needed. Not any more."
"So incredibly easy to upload designs.  There is no in between with POD's, they either have a super easy to use interface or you have to go around the world to get your design uploaded and looking right.  SPOD falls into the first category."
Nice user interface and fast shipping compared to other PODs. I like the clothing selection too.  Highly recommend.
"One of the best apps I've ever used, easy to use from the get go, beautiful simple interface and super helpful customer service. I didn't realise how easy it was to migrate to an app! 10/10 Thank you"
"I tried many other apps to create a mobile app for my website. So far none was like Shopney. Easy interface, pretty straight forward and most importantly you can customize your app however you want. Prices? Pretty fair for all of the features you can get out of this awesome app. I enrolled into the gold plan, and I'm pretty happy about it! Their support time is very cooperative and helpful with quick response times. Special thanks to Hazel as she is very patient with my questions.
If you are looking to launch an app for your store, go with Shopney!"
Designing the app was super simple thanks to their user friendly interface. Any questions I had were promptly answered by Melissa. I couldn’t have asked for a better experience with outstanding customer service!
Very easy to use to create your own app on Shopify! Great functionality on the interface and brilliant customer service to guide you through the process. 10/10.
Amazing service with great user interface and best customer support specially by melissa could not have asked for a better shopify app to grow my store.
"Best app for aliexpress dropshipping and there is also a free plan, simply wonderful, and beautiful interface.easy to use"
Very helpful. Easy to understand interface and worked when Oberlo didn't. I give it a solid 5/5 stars!!
"I'm relatively new to dropshipping and was looking for an app that optimized upsales and crosssales. The Bold Product Upsell, was by far the most highly rated when I researched into the different Apps out there. The interface is so easy to use and there are plenty of tutorials on YouTube from Bold and other Dropshippers who recommend the App.
Although I haven't been using the App for years, I have already witnessed it producing marvelous results! My sales have increased by 12.5% just down to this single App alone! 
I am definitely going to be using other products from Bold in the future as my store grows, such as Product Bundles and Product Discounts. I have no experience in coding or CSS and Bold solves this problem straight off the bat.
Number one Shopify App!  
The best thing is I haven't even needed to use the Bold support team! Bold make the App I use so simple to navigate, I have no need to contact them. The amazingly detailed YouTube advise videos from Bold gave me more than enough information to walk me step by step through all aspects of the App! I'm sure if I ever ran into any difficulty though, then the Bold support team would point me in the right direction as soon as possible."
Refersion offered exactly what my online store was looking for! The user interface is so easy to use and navigate. All the affiliate information is neatly placed in front you. The payment system is set up so it's very easy to keep track and pay your affiliates. I would recommend Refersion to any store owners looking to increase your traffic and sales.
"No fuss. Good Interface. Works really well! I would prefer if there are more customization but still, it does its basic function well!"
"Great app, and most importantly, impressive customer service. Just ask whatever you need and they'll make you happy! 
The interface isn't the nicest but it works well, and that's the important part.
Totally worth the money."
This app offers great customer service and has a Very intuitive interface. Would recommend because you can keep the customer's currency to the end of the transaction
"This app does a great job of filling the gaps in Shopify's native reporting tools. 
The user interface is not super intuitive, but the support is AMAZING - any time I need a report created or modified, all it takes is an email to them and the changes I need are created within a day. SO helpful. Highly recommend this app if you require any degree of comprehensive reporting."
"I installed the APP in my store yesterday and it is very easy to configure, its interface is clean and simple to use, for someone who does not have knowledge it will help a lot ... I give two stars because the most important thing in this application is not the WhatsApp Widged, but the automatic sending of an abandoned cart message ... unfortunately the template they have configured is very simple and they do not allow editing ... I asked them to help me to customize it and they refused ... I want to tell you that not all online stores are the same and each one has its own style to communicate with its customers, when they solve that problem I will hire their services and recommend them to my community."
"Really easy to set up, straightforward interface, and equally quick and easy to modify. Recommended."
"Perfect app. Easy to use, friendly interface and very responsive staff. Needed some help, got quick response even on weekend!"
"Optimizing images and cleaning up SEO were a breeze with TinyIMG. Customer support is by far the best and most responsive I've had on any third party app I've used on Shopify so far! Clean and easy to use interface and low, affordable pricing also put them over the top! If you're looking for image and website optimization that doesn't charge a ridiculous monthly subscription fee like most others, look no further than TinyIMG SEO & Image Optimizer. www.birdpalproducts.com"
"I highly recommend this app for updating your customer notifications. Up to this point, I've used Shopify's interface -- this app made the process so much easier, fast, and the emails look great. Very user-friendly. Thanks for creating an awesome app that saved me so much time!"
"Love the app and the super-slick interface both for the customer and to administer!
Eldar was great with his support and got me up and running with the integration quickly.
So far so good!  Just what I was looking for."
"We were ready to go live with our website but needed to leave the collections and shop locked for our private beta customers and hadn't a clue where to start. Enter Locksmith and Isaac -- what a life saver! Isaac was incredibly helpful in troubleshooting and creating additional workarounds that we were looking for. 
As others have said, Isaac is incredibly skilled but also provides a stellar user experience as well. This was the best customer experience I've had in a very long time! I can't recommend Locksmith or Isaac highly enough."
"I received absolutely first class support from Isaac. Quick to respond and fix a problem that was caused by another app, Plus he's a very pleasant chap.
Locksmith is working perfectly and is a must for our store. The admin interface is intuitive and slick and I love the feature that allows you to lock content based on customer tags, essential for custom user roles.
I whole heartedly recommend this app.
Many thanks!"
"UPDATE: 
Bold Options and Bold Upsell are awesome for both ease of use, performance and customer support. 
We had tried several other apps prior to finding Bold Options. It gives us the customization and add ons we needed without breaking the bank. It's robust, which typically means that the user interface is difficult. That is not the case with Bold Options. And if you do have a question, the support documentation is great and a friendly person is just a chat away. 
We are using a pretty robust theme and there was a need for Bold Options to do the install for us. We had a couple of functions of the theme that needed extra love and support was there to give it in a timely manner. In addition, they showed us a couple of things we didn't know about the theme. Pretty awesome!
We have engaged with support several times via chat, email and by phone. I really can't say one experience was better than the other because they all were stellar. Prompt, courteous service. A few specifics:
1. Custom Install. When asked how things were going after a couple of days (well within the window set of when install would be complete), my question was answered promptly and courteously. The install itself went smoothly. We then immediately updated to Premium and I reached out to Jade to make sure I had made the request correctly. The install was updated in less than an hour. Lots of love there.
2. Chat. I had an ongoing chat during one day while we were on our own learning curve. Rebecca - I don't think that's the right name - but she was awesome. Helped me get things set correctly.
3. Email. Email support has been great and prompt. I've engaged with Simranjit Singh, Jade, Mona Kundi and Nirav C (and I think one or two more). All have been great, responsive and clear in their communication.
4. Phone. Nirav deserves super kudos for working through our most recent support request having to do with customization of Quick Shop. This is an example of where there was a bit of user error on our part in that we didn't understand what wasn't showing up in our collections based on what was and was not in stock. He showed us the error of our ways, but in a supportive, non-shaming way. We really appreciated that!
I find the negative reviews a bit of a head scratcher. There's an ample free trial so I'd say go for it and call on support if you run into anything that seems to not be working for you.
ORIGINAL REVIEW:
It's only been a few days, but I am blown away by both the app and the support. On install - props go to Jade. He was quick and responsive when we upgraded to premium. Nice, too! I had a support issue on day one with the price not changing based on product options. I'm quite confident user error on my part. Rony on the chat rocked and reached out to one of his peeps, Rick, and they had it fixed immediately. Try the app. Use support. You won't regret it!"
"It's made to ensure a good User Experience on your site!
Thank you for your willingness and your fast support."
"Very responsive customer support, very sleek product! Would recommend. Really nice user interface, and they're willing to make it work for your theme too!"
Great interface and super helpful customer service. I had an issues and it was resolved right way via their chat option.  Highly recommended
"Boxify is awesome, and perhaps even better, is the masterful knowledge and ability to quickly and successfully troubleshoot problems when you reach their technical support.  In a world of plugins, apps, APIs, and multiple parties (e.g. Shopfiy, ShipRush, Boxify) all interwoven in the function of shipping and our eCommerce user experience - it is INVALUABLE to be able to get help and keep the customer experience optimized, display accurate rates, and understand how it all fits together.  
I use Boxify with my company as a plugin (app) to Shopify.
I had a question as to why one of the services (Fedex Ground) in this case was not appearing to customers on our website, and while this question had stumped Shopfiy on several calls, Dave from Boxify instantly knew the issue.  It took him about 10 seconds to ask the right question, and enable me to fix the problem (by un-hiding the ""Company"" form field in the Shopify checkout).    Further, I now understand the issue, which is that Fedex only offers Ground service for companies.  So, I then enabled the Fedex Ground Home Delivery option, which then solved my problem as well for residential addresses.  5 Gold Stars for Dave and Boxify!  
Whether this matters to you or not, or whether this was my own user error or not, it had stumped many others, but not Boxify.  My takeaway is that Boxify is a great service not only for the functionality they provide, but even more so from their expertise and ability thru customer support to help you use their service properly and get the most out of it."
"Good app to use. The interface is easy to understand and navigate. Had a bit of difficulty when setting up, but the instant customer service was very helpful. Thanks team!"
"Great app, has all the basic automations needed to run our eCommerce campaigns. The user interface is very easy to use and that was very important to us."
"I looked around quite abit for just the right Countdown Timer for my store. I wanted an easy to manage user interface, i wanted the timer to display just below the Add To Cart button, and i was super surprised it can be keyed to new visitors so the countdown doesn't reset for them if they come back later.
All in all, this App is perfect for anyone who needs an easy to use Countdown Timer for their store. There are more options than i mentioned here. It's just it was those specific features i wanted, so that's what i reviewed."
"Its so easy ! i love it
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
interface so amigable, and fast.. 
excellent"
Awesome app works great with our store and it works with the buy now button feature. Easy to use interface and very quick setup. I highly recommend it.
"I've tried refersion, affiliatly and promote and nothing can be comparable with the user interface of lead dyno+THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS SUPER FAST AND EASILY REACHABLE. 
Shoutout to Jennifer Goodman, customer service agent who answered to all my questions. I could feel her good energy through the leaddyno instant messaging platform."
"I am writing this review, after using this app for a couple of months.
This App is just PERFECT! Absolutely no problems whatsoever.
We have tons of products on our website i.e (headphonezone.in) but the app renders perfectly. 
The support is excellent! Really one of the best we've interacted with. Megan from their team is always super-helpful and it's really easy to connect with them. They reply instantly to queries and are super-fast in fixing minor issues. With them, we have fewer problems while handling this part of the website. 
I would definitely recommend this app to whoever is wanting to change their product page user experience on mobile as well as desktop.
Keep the good work guys! Cheers. 
- Aliza"
"Customisable and does exactly what I wanted. It was easy to install, has a professional interface, and fits well in my Shopify theme."
The interface is very easy to use and they have great customer service.
"Smoothest and BEST app I have ever used on Shopify. It works perfectly. The interface is beautiful. Makes my product pages look clean and organized.
Also, they have the FASTEST customer support service. I had a small problem (it was my fault) and it took 5 minutes from the moment I wrote to them to the moment it was solved. I'm impressed.
Don't even look at any other tab apps. This one is just perfect."
"This app has, so far, exceeded my expectations. I tried out Refersion first and it seemed pretty good but LeadDyno's interface and the affiliate dashboard blows Refersion out of the water. 
Also, LeadDyno's chat support is immediate and super helpful. Jennifer Goodman  just helped me and its so nice having instant, helpful support."
"This app is a very useful solution - imagine having your membership system literally run itself, no need to worry about payments or, if you are delivering online goods, about enabling access to content for members online. And any involvement on your part is made simple via the app interface which allows you to manage your memberships in a clean, clear interface. 
The level of automation offered by this app means that some coding is required - and stuff can go wrong at this stage - but the support team are very helpful, in my case Marty and Corey were on the case and got things resolved within the time promised. 
A great app to use if you are prepared to wait maybe two or three days setup time to iron out the code - but after that, your membership system is ready to run day-to-day without any intervention or management."
I love this interface so far. I can't give too much feedback just yet as I've recently began using it. But si far the GUI is very user friendly
This app is the single best app we could find for our store that really works well for GST invoicing. The support team is super helpful not just in solving queries and taking feedback but to implement that feedback for better user experience. Would highly recommend.
I very much like the chic simplicity of the interface but wish it was a little less bulky for java script!
Estou testando o app mais e muito bom para configurar boa interface e muito rápido eu recomento este app
I just installed it and it was pretty straight forward to set up.    I may update my review after it has been in use and I have a wider range of user experience to report upon.
"It works perfectly and free, although there is a little bugs in the user interface. The new email customization feature is awesome, I believe this would become a popular apps in the future"
5 Star rating app and support given by ZRX team. Very happy with the interface of the app and it is fulfilling my purpose to sell the bundles in our website. Kudos
"Excellent app and top-notch customer service! It's easy to use and has a clean interface. I had several questions/requests and Ohad always helped me. UPDATE: Unfortunately, the app didn't work with my theme, but I do recommend it for anyone looking for an app with great customer service and affordable prices."
"Good tracking interface. Very good also that it allows custom order statuses. Nice to have a free plan that gives 10 orders per month, but it would have been nice to have more.
The downside to the app is that even the Starter plan does not give email notifications. I opine that for that amount, it should. One shouldn't have to go to the Professional tier to have notifications. But then, I still would have upgraded to Professional if only the notifications would also be sent out for my custom statuses.
I really wanted to continue with this app, but after communicating with the developers, who were very responsive by the way, it doesn't appear my desired features would be coming anytime soon."
"An absolute must-have app.  I literally reviewed all of the apps on the Shopify store... looked at the number of reviews, the verbiage of the reviews (positive and negative), functionality, integrations, etc. and Excelify did not disappoint. 
This is a super easy app to use and it works perfectly.  There's a lot going on in these themes and I wasn't sure I would be able to manage to all of the sections effectively.  Not a problem w/Excelify.  
No review is worth its weight w/out an area of improvement... this is the only one that I've run across... knowing why an upload fails.  This is likely user experience/ignorance but I haven't figured that part out yet.  Luckily the app is so intuitive that I've only run into this issue once and worked it out using their tutorials.
One last thing, I'm the CEO not the CTO and most of you know what that means... this is one intuitive, easy to use app!
Update: As suspected user error was at play in the one area of improvement... Excelify reached out and showed me where to find the Import Results.  Just another reason to use this app.  The team has fantastic customer service!!!  Kudos Renars and Team!!!"
I love the app it looks great and provides a great interface for my customers. Not only that but the customer support team customized the appearance for me
"Absolute game changer. I personally love this app, your customers will love this app. This stops them from being all over the place, put the bundle and upsells right there to keep everything simple for user experience"
Nice clean interface. Super fast and helpful customer service. I have only used this to edit MetaTags... works nicely for that.
"I was about to leave a one-star review when I figured out why the app stopped working for us. 
Using Chrome on a Mac it prints very tiny, so you need to bring the printer settings back up to 100%. It defaults to 58% for whatever reason.
Using a Windows laptop and Chrome, it won't open at all because Chrome is blocking the pop-up, even when you set the app url permission for the pop up and redirect.
CHECK CHROME POP UP AND REDIRECT SETTINGS when trying to print an order with this app. It is not the app itself, as far as I can tell. Something has changed in Chrome. You will see a warning on the browser address bar when you select to print the invoice. Click on that and go from there. It is not saving the permission for us but the url is there as a link. Just click on that link and the order printer interface will open.
I have contacted Shopify and they are looking into this too. 
In the meantime hope this helps and you get your orders printed easily!"
"An absolute breath of fresh air.
Had a real mess on my hands after using a different app to import orders from an old eCommerce platform into Shopify and hitting a lot of errors.
Using Excelify I was able to fix the issues.
User interface is easy. Documentation is thorough and support is incredible.
Would highly recommend."
Super easy to use and great interface/look!
good apps...so helpful and will gonna used it for now. keep it up and improve it with better interface
"Simple to install and tons of options for customizing the interface. 
Thanks powr for a fantastic pre built FAQ. Would highly recommend this to anyone needing a effective FAQ page."
"By far the most important app for stores with many products. The app allows for complex changes through a simple interface. Get the app before you start any big jobs in Shopify, you will be glad that you did! Maris and support team are the best!"
"Great user experience, and I think our product page visitors will be more informed and more likely to purchase using this FAQ plugin!"
"I just installed the app only yesterday, contacted the support team twice and in both times they replied back in no time and with my requirements done. The app is more than I expected and I’m sure I will be satisfied with the outcome. Interface is clean and makes customers feel at ease. Thank you Adi for your amazing support and the team for this amazing app, highly  recommended...look no further!!!"
Incredibly easy way to create amp pages for your entire store.  Customer service is extremely responsive and helpful.  New version 2.0 has a fantastic and clean user interface.  Highly recommend.
"I love this app, It has all I need in terms of customization for products in my new Store, it looks amazing and with almost no effort, You can create stunning User experiences that will amaze your customers and also it will make your products super easy to customize. Customer service went above and beyond to help me, I could not be more happy with the help assistance I got from the customer service team, They are super friendly and professional, every single question, concern, and request I had was solved and explain promptly and satisfactorily. 100% recommended, Stop looking around for product customizer apps, I tried many different ones and I can say with confidence that Inkybay is 10 times better than any other one I tried."
excellent app that is simple to use and nice interface. looking forward to seeing pages indexed soon.
"This is exactly what I was looking for! Clean, straight forward, and easy to use. I hope that plan to release a Constant Contact interface soon."
it works great! Fast and efficient support! You can chat directly with supporter on app interface! They can fix your problem until you feel happy.
This new Fuel app is so great. I was able to setup by products in just minutes. The interface is easy to use and the products ship quick.
"At the risk of sounding too much like other reviews, I have to say we echo much of what has been said already.  We have really enjoyed using this app.  We have tried many design studios, including much more expensive ones that don't function nearly as responsively as this one.  Customer service has been quick to respond to our questions and special requests.  Tutorials for every section are readily available within the app, making setup fairly easy.  
The studio loads quickly, scales perfectly on mobile, and is deeply customizable.  The interface appears simple, but is surprisingly deep and complex - the app can be used for a variety of items and has some products pre-loaded as well.  It's difficult to explain how deep this app really is - it can definitely keep up with the other guys on the market.  Loading custom products is easy, as well as assigning various prices based on sizes, colors, printing methods, or whatever you choose.  
Rashed has been awesome at providing clear, easy to understand solutions to any issues we had.  Photos/Videos are provided for any changes we need to make on our end, while other customization requests have been honored surprisingly quick.  We work in a very complex market (screen printing and embroidery) and it can be difficult to price all the different scenarios our customers can choose from.  Inkybay however has met our needs and we haven't even used it to it's full potential (for example: creating art designs and adding more custom graphics).  We look forward to continuing to use this app and are very happy with it."
"This app is fantastic! I went through nine different customization apps- installing each app, learning to use them, trying to make them do what I wanted-- but every app had at least one ""deal-breaker"" that made me uninstall it. You may think I'm exaggerating, but I'm not. Nine customization apps that you can find here on Shopify.  Inkbay's was the tenth, and this powerful app is the only one that allowed me to do everything I needed, and even included a few features that I hadn't thought of, but were great improvements over the way I planned to do things. 
The app is not the easiest to understand at first glance, but the Inkbay support team was happy to arrange a Skype call to guide me through and answer all of my questions. Once you get the concept, everything falls into the place, and working with the interface becomes simple.
Inkbay's app allows you to have an incredible number of variations and options to your product, and to view those variations through custom images. Pricing can be adjusted within each individual option and the customer can see price changes dynamically as they make their picks. And the personalization tools are top notch! They include scores of fonts, but you can upload your own. Customers can curve text, resize text, flip text, add drop-shadows, outlines. There's also a simple clip-art gallery (you can add more images to it if you want something fancier) and customers can upload their own images. Just fantastic stuff. 
And as hard as it is to believe, the customer service is even better than the app! The gang at Inkbay has completed every request I have made. They completely re-designed the interface to suit my design sensibilities and the style of my site. I sent them what I wanted the interface to look like (a completely new design) and, within a few days, they had the interface looking exactly like what I had sent. This type of custom design work would have cost thousands if I had hired someone to do it. The Inkbay team did it for free. It's obvious that they are committed to top-notch support for their app, and that they hold themselves to a very high standard. I couldn't be happier with them and their app. Can't rate this app highly enough."
AMP Pages are great.  They're super fast loading for mobile users and integrate easily with google search console.  They're essentially essential for ecommerce stores looking to increase their site speed and mobile user experience.
"I loved this app so much that I have it on all my Shopify stores now! Amazing user experience and quick results. Thank you, Stephen and team, for being so responsive and helpful!! Highly recommended."
"Top notch customer service, great app, good user experience. You can pretty much customize anything you want, great for shops with many products. Highly recommended!!"
"Works great, the interface is good and intuitive, looks beautiful on the site. I had some minor trouble with some colors not looking as I wanted them to... support team fixed it in less then 12 hours. Overall great app and great team."
"The app focuses on the user interface, making it professional and you can drive the user to more cart stickiness; only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the wheel and subscription triggers which in my opinion are useless as you need to create and insert manual discount codes, which totally misses the point and some users can use that in a fraudulent way. Point from automatic code generation are: 1- it's totally unique for that specific user, can't be shared or used by another
2- The app needs to develop a countdown timer to the expiry of that particular code, to stimulate urgency and complete the sale
3- As store owner, you'll get to know how much you're spending as ""discount"" for your CAC."
Good app to follow up with the abandoned carts. Simple interface and easy to configure.
"This app offers a great product selection with professional photos and videos. So far, my only problem has been syncing the app with my personal drop shipping website, but I was quickly assisted by customer rep ""Rabbani shaik"" to help with the issue. Additionally, the user interface could be better optimized for newer users, but overall, the pros certainly out weight the cons. - A highly recommended app."
"Great, excellent email service. Easy to setup. The interface is good, and now my store can choose different currency now."
"By far the best product personalization app in the App Store. Take my words for it as I almost tried everything here. If you want to add text, images to your product as a personalization option, this app can do anything. They just need to develop a little on the user interface, sometimes you get hard to find your way thru, but there is an AMAZING support team on the back end, they literally answer in seconds, and walk you thru the steps with patience. Overall, a great app and a great team. I believe if they keep making this app more visual to users, it will be the number one personalization app very soon!"
"I really like FreeAgent as an accounts package and use it on several other business ventures.  I was therefore really pleased to see there was an interface to Shopify for my latest venture, however after nearly a month trying to get this working reliably with FreeAgent Support and the developers Codat I have had to throw the towel in on this one.  I've reverted to manual updates for now and when that gets too much of a burden I will have to look for another accounts package that can interface well with Shopify.  Such a shame but from my experience I would have to have this is an avoid."
"I used orberlo, dropified in the past, in terms of user interface i am still new with CJ and find it a little difficult, however, their customer service and support is top notch, whenever i have difficulties, i would just pop a question and within 2 mins, there will be someone there to reply you and assist you with links, pictures and instructions what to do. Yes the products are limited, and sometimes the sourcing is not exactly what you need but this is normal and they are improving. i really look forward to improve together with them and work with them more in future"
"Postscript has been exciting for our customers and we look forward to using it more. Very easy interface and the help content is great. Cailee helped us implement Postscript into our stack even though we weren't initially a Shopify store, by using Zapier and a bare minimum Shopify plan. Now our Kajabi site works with SMS which wasn't possible before with any other platforms and we look forward to seeing what SMS does for Hidden Jiu-Jitsu."
"Amazing customer support and easy-to-use interface!! Also, the tips they send through their newsletter are super helpful!"
"The interface is unnecessarily complicated. Too many screens have to be navigated to accomplish knowing if there are messages or even replying. However, it is useful and we will continue using it. Recommendation - make the dashboard the place linked to messages and be able to respond much more easily."
So far so good. We have our first campaign running to convert our email customers to text customers and it is going great. The interface is easy and intuitive. Michael hooked me up via chat when I had questions.
"We moved over from Attentive and couldn't be happier. Our client services manager is incredibly proactive and helpful in guiding us on execution of new ideas and best practices, and we love how nimble we can be with Postscript's interface and functionality."
"Senthil from CodeBlackBelt responded to my request to place the recommendations bar below my customer photo reviews.
The request was made through the app interface, and he fixed it instantly.
For that I had to write a personal review. That is top class customer service in my opinion. 
This app is the best looking Recommendations app. Maybe the user interface can be better than a long list of text, but the end result for my customers is what looks best without being too loud."
"This App is perfect for my store. The user interface is really intuitive (especially for a new user), no need for instructions! It is reliable and does everything it is intended to do. Thank you HulkApps for this awesome product. I'm on the Pro Plan. I have to mention that their customer service and technical support is excellent too. I would highly recommend this App!"
This was one of the easiest apps to install and configure. Great interface and professional looking. Love it! I will greatly recommend it.
"The app is really good. Intuitive interface. Very, very friendly and helpful technical support. Of all the things I've tried (and that's a lot) This is the best app of all! I am with you forever ;) Thanks!"
Very good and easy to work. All the interface is very easygoing and the support team is awesome! A+++
This s probably the best contact form app there is. With easy to follow instructions and simple interface..creating a contact form was a bliss!
very nice app easy to install and very smooth user interface. helped with the purpose for which it was installed.recommended
"It looks like iI picked a winner, quick interface and very easy to use , good job guys wes @ https://platinumleatheremporium.com/"
Great app. Very simple interface with many advanced and pre-set features.
"Great customer support, there's always a team member available to help with requests and the interface is very user friendly!"
"terrible user experience, they want you credit card in order to do a free mock up. feels like a scam, avoid them till they learn how to build an app"
Good and easy to use interface. Helps me bring in abandoned cart customers.
Very Proactive on the chat and help with getting your site up and running. Highly recommend. Easy to use interface!
"great product, great interface"
"If you have multiple product variants, it lumps them all into a single dropdown, which makes choosing the correct combination very frustrating for the user. Why can't it just provide the same interface as on a regular product page?"
"Great app, very userfriendly interface. I am looking forward to the update with the new features. That will make this app the one stop shop!"
"Wonderful App, Seamlessly integrated with our theme. Clean, Crispy looking user interface which is very easy to navigate and use. No Coding required. Some truly amazing features here and loads very quickly. Cheers, EuropaBay Limited"
"I am using PushOwl from years, and it done wonders. This app is so useful for every website, whether its new or already established. The interface is user friendly and most likely the staff is so helpful and ready to help at every step, which makes it so smooth to use the app."
I just started using the app and was kindly offered a free plan for small businesses. The customer support was very helpful with the set up and the app interface is beautiful & easy to use. Excited to continue using this and see the results!
"So Far The Interface Is Very User-Friendly and Everything is working as it should be, Once I create products I will Add Links .. BUT the reason am giving 5 Stars and I really Recommend Everyone to Try and Support this App.. is BECAUSE the Super Amazing Support and Customer Services, and The Creator ""Nate"" has a Channel on Youtube which is, in my opinion, The One and Only Transparent Channel about ""Shopify and Facebook Ads "" out There .. No Hidden Fees No Bullshit, The App till Now didn't Force Or Even Ask to review .. which make me come and write the review because I Felt Like .. I Recommend and I Will Update as i am Trying it .."
Useful App with an ingeniously User-Friendly Interface and Excellent Tech-Support / Customer Service.
"Wishlist King is the BEST
Beautiful integration, fast support on a custom install, fits easily and perfectly into our theme and user interface to make the experience for shoppers pleasant and seamless. 
Great addition to the stable of apps we are using!"
"i like this app so far just started using it so not much user experience to give a valid opinion.
will update"
This is such a wonderful app! Accurately tracks status of all orders. The user interface is also great.
This is the best tracking App. It has been functioning wonderfully and the support has been just awesome. The user interface of the App is also awesome and clean.
"The App is amazing. I made my first sale on the second day. Easy user interface. I didn't use any other apps for upselling and cross-selling, but I recommend this one."
"Very nice app, eye catching interface,and the developer team is very friendly & helpful . i just love this app"
"Testing app, waiting for conversion details. Good interface. The rest of this is just to fill the 100 character minimum :) yessir"
"Nice app with efficient support! A lot of useful features and a great interface.
Strongly recommend this app."
I really like how easy this App is compared to some other App. It helped a great deal. The interface is really easy to set up. We were able to monitor our Abandonned Carts.
"Great interface and capabilities.  Got us extra sales just in the first day of using it, can't wait for more"
Seamless interface and lots of great features! It's also really cool that this app is free unlike most of the others that are similar
"This is a nice addition to Shopify since Shopify does not provide bulk discounts, only percentages off products with a coupon code. HulkCode provides a nice interface to substitute for this. It's reasonably easy to manage once you get used to it, and displays on the product pages nicely."
Really useful app. The tracking feature that you can add to your store is super helpful and gives the customer a good user experience that looks very professional. Would highly recommend.
I really like how easy  ParcelPanel is to install and that it offers a perfect and very simple User Interface. 5 stars!
The interface and backend looks nice and very professional. I also like how the map looks and its easy to use.
"Great interface and just able to design as I wish. I got some troubles while customize and setting things up, Sarah is so helpful during the journey. Although I might need to message them for follow-up sometimes, I understand they might be busy. Overall, for a Free app at the start, it's a very good app. Can't wait to see the AOV raise after launch."
App was nice Recommended The design is simple and the interface is user-friendly It updates the status of my parcel fast
Everything going well so far. Quick installation and worked as intended. Easy to use interface. Thank you.
"Besides the buggy interface and slow customer service that I had previously written about, I just got served a $189 invoice by the app! Due to a ""mistake"" at their end they hadn't billed me for over 10months and then suddenly I receive an invoice which I am expected to pay. Had I known I was being charged every month, I wouldn't have continued with this app, since it is most definitely not worth the charge. There are plenty of apps that work better than this one, at a fraction of the price. My initial review is below My initial experience with the app was great. But on using it further it was way to buggy. I had to spend a lot of time going back and forth with the developers to get the app to work smoothly for my theme and inspite of being a paid customer and waiting for more than 4-5 days my issues were unable to be completely resolved"
"After some initial issues with the app, the CEO reached out and was able to resolve the issues very quickly. I really wanted this app to work because it has a beautiful interface and it was easy to set up and customize new offers. So far things are now working wonderfully and I would recommend this app after trying others in this space."
"Its great. Love the app and its features. Quite a light app and friendly interface. Most of the badges available for free. 
I Recommend this app."
Way better than other upsell apps in the market. Great interface and customer support. Plus it is free for the first 50 orders.
"The automated cart recovery circuit is very useful and easy to setup. The interface is easy to use, and very customizable."
"The Hulk team are so unbelievably friendly and professional, and incredibly knowledgable, they installed the app to my website very quickly and efficiently. Whilst sadly the app didn't have the type of discount I wanted (buy 3 for combined y price e.g. buy 2 for £50) meaning I had to uninstall it, I can see that this app will be perfect for most other types of discounts. This app is perfect for most discounts, and its interface can be integrated with the colours and themes of your online store so branding is consistent! Based on the above I would highly recommend this app :)"
Beautiful interface and amazing customer service!. They are always ready to help. they really do an amazing job!
"Very clean application and support very responsive to requests, I recommend the use of this application. Very clean interface also and easy to use."
Very helpful app. Great User Interface. Light-weight code. Great customer support. And its free!!! It basically does what other paid apps only try to accomplish at no cost. Also the Customer support is very helpful and resourceful. Thank You Sarah. I hope this app remains true. I would recommend for all your Sales Funnel needs.
"Great app interface, totally customizable AND AMAZING COSTUMER SERVICE! really recommended until we will see how the paid plan is..."
"Really love the easy to use interface and upsell options it provides. And, the best part is it's free and that really helps people like us who are just starting their online business. Thank you!"
"Trust me after searching for an app that does alot, I stumbled upon UFE I cannot be so much more grateful for the developers to make an app like this which has all the bundling requirements I need. The customer support is amazing and the interface for creating your bundles/funnels is intuitive, user-friendly, simplistic.
I Highly recommend this app"
"100% Legit app! It has an excellent interface. There are a lot of things you can add, some seem a bit pushy but you can customize it all to how you want!"
"Best upsell bundle app on the market. Super user friendly
easy to use, pretty interface, and awesome support!"
Great tools for optimizing your footprint online. Also a very simple to use interface. I am pleased with the quality of work thus far.
"So far so good! One week in and I like the easy interface. There are a lot of things you can add, some seem a bit pushy but you can customise it all to how you want"
I love the integration on the app. very clean interface. The app makes it very easy to send old customers emails. I am very glad I added this app to our store. I think it is important to be able to reach out to customers who may have been on the fence. I’ve the app 5 stars
Not cheap and very slow user interface but okay solution overall.
"Everything has worked Great for 5+ years that I’ve used it... Until Today! The new user interface is absolutely Atrocious. The screen looks cluttered, you can’t easily view the items listed in each order clearly because of the massive about of text on the screen. The layout is terrible, and the options for editing customs forms on international shipments is horrendous. If I can’t go back to the original layout, I’m leaving Shippo immediately."
"Warning for users with Canada Post API integration
I cannot speak for all Shippo user experiences. We are a Canadian e-commerce company using a commercial Canada Post account with API integration. In our case, the app has singularly failed to live up to its core promise of time and money savings. I have no doubt that Canada Post is likely most at fault, but Shippo should not be ""pretending"" that it works.
Our quest for lower rates began with the opening of a commercial account with Canada Post. After completing their application form, a rep from CP contacts you to begin the opening of an account. There should be an in-boarding process here, but it is merely a welcome email with incomplete pdf details on the process. You will be put in contact with a local sales rep. The rep is an elusive sort that does not return calls, and seems to be very adept at ghosting new clients. I speak only for the Nova Scotia market. Perhaps there are more diligent reps in other regions of Canada?
With a commercial shipping account, you are able to create labels and shipping manifests, and then schedule pickups directly to a warehouse. As a Shopify user you would also expect to be able to do this seamlessly within the Shopify environment. There should be no need to enter customer details and otherwise manually propagate data. Canada Post has not developed their own app for Shopify. They provide electronic shipping tools on a PC environment only. That is unfortunate, as all of our work stations are Linux. CP is completely dependent on third parties to manage shipping on Shopify.
The App
With the need for a CP compatible app we searched and found Shippo. In the setup we were able to enter our CP, API keys to enable billing directly to CP at the commercial rate. The setup process was straight forward, and the supporting docs and videos were very informative. So far so good. We had a couple hiccups with some settings errors that were easily solved . We created our first batch of 6 labels and created the manifest with ease. You can't schedule a CP pickup from the app. No big deal...only time. Just login to CP and schedule there.
Signs of trouble
On our third use of the system we tried to purchase 25 labels at once. You need to select each one individually as far as we can tell, then click buy labels. In a normal function, you would then get the option to send email notifications to clients, print packing lists, and more importantly download all the shipping labels for printing. What happened to us was an error with the shipping labels. The file would not load. So we have no labels. We made a call with Shippo support. I will add that it was easy to reach support, and they were quick to follow up. We were instructed that the labels were successfully purchased, but the load failure requires us to open and print each label individually? This was only 25 labels, but we have other things to do in our new Covid world. The time and efficiency promise is looking a bit weak here. So each label was opened and printed one by one. I asked about a log or some other way to find the batch, but when it fails, there are no more options. You need to deal with each order separately. A further surprise is that one purchased label could not be downloaded. This was clearly the label that may have caused the entire batch to fail. This is where I suspect some sort of CP API failure. So with the inability to simply refund the label you need to have Shippo find it. This is an issue the rep sends to the dev team. In this case they were able to retrieve the single missing label. That is good, because I don't want to try to negotiate a refund with CP hours on the phone, or have to buy it again which is another time and money fail.
Abandon hope all ye who enter here
We printed a few more orders each time making a prayer before batching labels. You never know when it is going to fail, and you have to think ahead about time required to fix the issue. As the business owner, I could not turn the process over to staff. They are stressed enough and I do not want to burden them with a faulty process.
So as a very busy person, I was not able to enter our mailroom for three days. The delay caused a backup of over 100 parcels ready to be shipped. I asked staff to enter weights and dimensions into the Shippo system. This way they would be ready for label printing and batching. We can't use pre entered dimensions. Our carts are combining products so we need to enter unique dimensions each time. We are ok with that aspect. 
I created a batch of 65 labels. The system churned and generated the fail I dreaded. My heart sank as it was already a late evening, that was about to get later. However this time there was a new failure that appeared. There was a ""shipping date error"" that made 13 of the orders ineligible for a label purchase. So out of the batch I had 52 good labels that could not be downloaded and 13 that did not generate at all? I was also unsure if it was safe to even send shipping notification emails. What would our customers receive? So many questions. I then tried to batch the remaining 45 orders. Again the system failed to generate labels and this time there were over 30 orders with shipping date fails that stopped the label purchasing.
There was a moment where I realized the scope of the problem. It was 8:00 pm, and I knew it was going to be a late night. I would have a hundred customers jamming our email with inquiries about their orders. And no answers to give.
So a call to Shippo was made. The volume of parcels and the multiple ship date errors failures, made this a much harder problem to solve. It is also becoming increasingly clear from pieces of information I am picking up from the reps, and reviews, that batching errors is a thing with Shippo. Sometimes it works great for users, then Shippo does an update.
The call begins with the regular issues. Labels did not load and some labels cannot be downloaded individually. In this case we had 21 purchased labels that could not be downloaded individually or simply vanished? Then we have 40+ cases of a new error with the shipping date bug that prevents the label from being purchased. With all the mayhem, I was not confident with sending any shipping notifications to clients, because who knows what was going on. This decision was not made lightly, as now we will be expecting at worst, a hundred customers reaching out to us on a variety of social channels and email complaining about the status of orders.
It gets worse.
 The Shippo rep is clearly frustrated with the situation during the multiple calls between me and her team members.  We are all trying to be professional, but she was clearly being short with me, and I was frantic with the workload ballooning by the minute. 
At this point the scale of the failure is a bit beyond what I can fully interpret. My guess is that some back and forth with the dev team occurred, and the solution was to load our shipping work flow into an older version of Shippo? I suppose a version that was not full of bugs and despair. So this is how it played out in short form
a. We had to go into each order and print a shipping label for purchased labels.
b. shipping error orders: These are the labels that did not get purchased. The fix here was onerous. Remember all the dimensional data I had my staff enter. It was all lost when the Shippo dev moved our order data to the older OS. I had to then go into our mailroom and physically find parcels in a literal pile, so I could weigh and measure them again. Then I had to purchase and download a label for each order individually. I had to go back and find over forty parcels on our warehouse floor. This might have been the ideal point in the evening to drink disinfectant.
c. Purchased labels that failed to download. With no means to ship, get refunds, or otherwise not incur losses with these parcels. Shippo asked us to give them a list of parcels in this category. Surprisingly they could not find this batch of errors on their own. They initially insisted that we were mistaken and they had tested the labels and they were all available. They likely did test a couple that worked, and just decided it was fine. I was more diligent and went through them all and found 21. The list was emailed to them, and while I write this review I have yet to hear what happened to these labels? These parcels are currently sitting on a warehouse floor. They should be on the way to customers. The damage to the bottom line is now getting real with unhappy customers. My only option is to buy a second round of labels and then battle with the inept team at CP for a refund? Please shoot me.
d. Despite plugins failing, we can always rely on Shopify order data to remain pristine. Well not so fast. As Shippo flailed with their ""fixes"" I took a quick peek at our order history. I noticed some orders simply disappear from our Shopify order history! Orders that were tangled with the Shippo bugs. The only record of them ever existing is the physical parcel sitting on our warehouse floor. Shippo has yet to recognize what happened there. They simply have no idea, and said to follow up with Shopify.
My Review:
 I would not be surprised to hear that Shippo works flawlessly in other markets. My experience in Canada with Shippo is simply the worst plugin failure ever experienced in 20 years of e-commerce. It easily tripled the time it takes to process orders and create labels. It did this while adding unknowns to our customer experience. 
Yes, that bad. There is critical weakness in the platform in its ability to deal with core system failures. Systems do fail and you need to plan for it. A platform has to develop safeguards and backups. When the wheels fall off Shippo's cart, they have no ability to triage. They clearly didn't do the hardwork on the backend that one would expect. I have no doubt they are fully aware of the weaknesses and infrastructure is currently in development as we speak. That said, it is worrisome that someone would put a product like this out in the market and not call it a BETA. If you are still in BETA, be responsible and let your customers know. 
May 2nd: Update, It seems some of the disappeared orders have suddenly appeared again in our Shopify orders list. They show as unfulfilled despite labels being purchased, and picked up by Canada Post. But at least they exist for now? 
May 4th: We are still waiting for Shippo to find labels for the 21 parcels sitting on our warehouse floor. Our account is still operating in an older version of the app. That means no batching or clear process for us to follow. Their dev team is either ignoring us or have lost the data completely. We have 95 new parcels to ship and we are not getting any advice to proceed. Made several calls to Canada Post. Their tech team informs me that they had recommended to management that CP should have created their own shipping app. This advice has been ignored. Canada Post is now recommending that we move our shipping operations to ShipStation? 
June 5th: It has been some time since our last update. A Shippo rep moved us back to the current OS. We are still using Shippo. We did not wait for Shippo to find the missing labels. We just went to each individually and created new labels. Canada Post confirmed that they do not charge until they scan them into their system. (Remember that we are using our own commercial account with CP). If you created new labels without an account, you may be double purchasing labels. 
Admittedly, there is still a high level of anxiety after earlier experiences. The scariest part of using Shippo is still the batching process when purchasing labels. We do not do batches larger than 20 labels. Since we started reducing the size of the batches, we have not had any crashes or label generating failures. The system seems to be working well at the moment. Today we noticed that the customer names in the order list have suddenly disappeared? They had been populating since we started using the system. We did not reconfigure any setting. Perhaps Shippo did another update? 
I am comfortable to update our review to three starts at this point. It is buggy and has some surprises but generally they are on the right track to making a great platform. 
June 10th:
Oh dear. Shippo must be playing with code again. We have another label creation failure with no clear path to resolution. After entering all the package details we received a message about a carrier error. We should be seeing the option to buy the label. To be clear we are in Canada and ship 99% of our orders in Canada only. We have a commercial Canada Post account and have integrated our Canada Post production API key into Shippo. Somehow we are linked to DHL? This could not have happened on a worst day. Clients are emailing for package updates and we have nothing to send. Going back to 2 stars today. We should have completed mailing today and moved on to our other hundred tasks. Now we need to work this problem and wait for Shippo support to contact us. I have yet to hand over the process of mailing to staf,f because I can't be certain that Shippo will be reliable. That is the simplest way to describe the app. 
Couldn't generate rates
- Shippo's DHL Express master account doesn't support shipments from outside of the US   ???????????????"
"This app is amazing, not only for searches but also providing quality user experience for my customers. What really made this app stood out to me is the amazing customer support from Neha and Naveen. Hell, they even wrote me an email to personally integrate Judge.me with their app when they realized I had it installed. Never asked for it, never even knew that was possible. I was pleasantly surprised. 
I highly recommend this app for anyone wanting to improve their user experience, backed by a reliable customer support team."
"We have been using Shippo for years. Hands down the best for any startup, Shippo houses simple rates and an efficient-user-interface."
"Huge fan of Shippo. Good rates, good support, and 10/10 user interface. Would recommend to anyone looking to ship products."
Excellent app and customer service! Inexpensive shipping rates and easy to navigate interface is a plus :)
"Shippo is the easiest and best shipping app out there ! I am a canadian business and I have been using it for a year.  I have tried a few at the beginning and I fell in love with Shippo.  It's easy to use, I love the interface, I can print my labels but also my customs documents in on place, and all that at an excellent price.
I have had to use support a month ago to help with a problem in the system after a change in Shopify and the support was fast and courteous and the problem was solved quickly.
I recommand this app higly !"
"A highly recommended app. 
A simple yet effective app and a very userfriendly interface. However it would be great if it can be fully Customised eg. changing of font type etc."
"We used this app to rotate our top features of our website.  I ran into an overlap problem with another bar with Privy, and reached out to Privy for help.  It's been 48 hours and I still haven't heard from Privy, so I said, let me try reaching out to the other bar, which was Seguno's Banner Suite.  
Marc, one of the developers. understood and guided me through the steps to take with code to get his Seguno bar in the right place.  He was very personable and I felt like he was honored to have his app on our site and that he cared about our experience with it, as well as the way it added to the important announcements of our online business.
Finally, the app is actually fun to use with all the options and it is a relief to see it in action the way one envisions.
Many thanks to Marc and his team...if you are looking for a sticky banner with multiple messages and links, this is the one to get.
If I were to say if there is anything for improvement, yes:
- It takes a while to load on a live site.  It would be nice if it loaded at the same time as the rest of the main site that Shopify hosts.
- On the interface, you cannot arrange the multiple announcements.  You have to cut and paste. It would be easier if you could move their order through the app interface instead.
-There should be the option to add more announcements to the multiple announcements.  Right now I think you can have about five but we have around 8 slideshow photos, so it'd be nice to coincide with those 8 slides instead of repeating the announcements."
"Laggy, slows down the page by several seconds, which is a huge amount of time and people don't want to wait forever for a page to load. 
Also, no discernible difference between the ""Slide in smoothly"" option and, ""Just appear."" Due to the lag, they both appear the same way. 
If you + your customers can handle that, the simple user interface install/set-up is super simple.
However, will be uninstalling, unfortunately."
"We've been using Shippo for several years now and love the easy interface. Pulling quotes and shipping orders is easy and flexible, and works with our existing UPS and FedEx accounts."
"Been using it for 3 years now and am very satisfied. Customer service is fast and responsive, and the interface is excellent. It's actually easier for me to scan my unfulfilled orders in Shippo than Shopify (sorry Shopify)."
Wonderful customer service and such a user-friendly interface. I would recommend Shippo to anyone!
Top-notch! User friendly interface with all the necessary details to ship worldwide. The support team also provides excellent customer service if you ever need them.
Great app. The push features are basic and straightforward. A few intuitive changes to the interface would definitely change my rating to a 5 star.
Quite a good easy interface in terms of designing products but a big minus for us is the automatic order routing. For example when picking a product you are informed that it ships from 2 locations in Europe. Then you get an order in Europe and Printful informs you that it is shipping from the USA. Due to automatic routing you do not have the option to change this. I would not recommend this for European orders.
Amazing integration. I can't imagine anything easier. Printful's design interface is super easy and comparable to Canva.
"The interface is very easy to use, but the rates are mediocre compared to other apps, I am using XPS for my shipping now, the rates are much better.
They get 3 stars for being easy to reach and good customer service, seem like good people over the , hopefully the rates will reflect it someday."
"AMAZING!!! SO MUCH BETTER THAN SHIPSTATION!!!!!! 
I've been using shipstation with constant headaches - error messages, issues with the carrier integrations... I am so happy I took the time to make the switch!!! Could not recommend Shippo enough. It's such a refreshingly simple and intuitive interface. It has all the features and auto-filling you need to make the whole thing run smoothly. If there's one thing I'd change, it would be better ways to combine or split shipments - this is commonplace and the 'help articles' recommend workarounds, not real solutions."
"John from support has been very helpful and attentive. I've been testing this product for a few weeks, my main use case is to bulk generate gift cards. This is the only solution ive found that can actually do this. Also a very easy user interface. Id recommend."
"This plataforma is the best! Great service and Quality of products!
100 % recomendable.
Easy and fast interface, service 24/7 all the year!"
Amazing Interface...easy to use...works like pro.. i would recommend this free app rather than paid in market..
"Awkward interface. I do appreciate the batch print feature, but I don't love having to manually reset the printer used, the paper size, and the scale factor every time I go to print. That being said, I'm quite appreciative of the fact that the app is free, and hope that Shopify continues to improve the functionality."
"Rise support has been very helpful with all of our questions. Hila, Pauline, Itay, and John have been excellent! The user interface is intuitive and straightforward. Setting up our store credit and gift card product has been a breeze. Thanks, rise.ai!"
"Terrible customer service! I have written in 4 or 5 times to check on an order that has gone missing and they refuse to get back to me. I even upgraded to Printify premium hoping to finally get a response, to no avail. If you have order issues I do NOT recommend printify. It's a shame because the interface is good and easy to use but they ignore my requests for help and I paid a lot for this order."
Good app. Seems to work well. I found the user interface was easy to use. I like that I can do abandon cart sms. Im a big fan.
"it is easy to use, great ! and it is help to sell more product, get great user experience, so thankful"
"I studied some Print of Demand apps, Printify app I liked more and I chose it for my new store. It's hard to launch a new store during such a period, but it's the best way to see how the Printify team works in such conditions, when every order may take their attention. I'm completely satisfied with their support, it's always very helpful, I was in contact with many employees already and they do their best to solve the troubles and questions. 
The app itself is made brilliant, it's the best solution I've ever seen. The interface is clear and very convenient to use. I don't plan to find something else ) 
P.S. The price is also ok!"
"Perfect app! It works perfectly well and it is very easy to use. Interface is very simple and straightforward, nothing confusing really. Highly recommended app!"
"Why are you paying for other FB abandoned cart apps when this is free? Not only that but it does so much more and even SMS, makes no sense installing any other app and the support is excellent. Someone is always around to answer the live chat messages within the app interface. HIGH RECOMMENDED!"
"This app works exactly as stated. It helps boost brand credibility with customer reviews and allows you to hear user experiences good and bad, which helps improve business processess."
"The Good
Simple interface, ideal for attaching pdf instruction manuals or rebates to products.
The Bad
No customization
No sorting options
No way to purge items from the list without editing individual products and removing their associated files
After adding a digital attachment to a product you must refresh the page to change the settings on how that digital file is delivered.  There is no way to configure default settings to apply to all products you carry.
If you use SmartVendor-Shopify E360 removing products with smartvendor breaks the list and leaves phantom entries.  There is no way to remove these entries.  We are looking at completely removing the app and reinstalling it to try to fix/simplify the list.
When we asked about future development we were referred on to a $40/month product that does not work well with stores that have a large number of sku's.  We have 4000+ so it would not have worked for us.
No way to attach files to a parent item and all it's sub-variants.  Even if all variants use the same file they must all be added individually.
This is all disappointing.  The app has a huge potential as an improvement in the system but Shopify seems to be more interested in farming it out to third party developers."
Nice app. I hope it will be better if the app can be installed easily and needs some improvements with the interface too.
"A great app, very functional, user-friendly admin interface, seamless customer login experience. Very reactive 24/7 support team! Guys, if you are looking for a functional, reasonably priced loyalty & referral app this is the ONE! Great for translating to your countly language (most shopify apps are not that apt)."
"I spent a long time researching loyalty apps to ensure I picked the right one to both reward my existing customers and also attract new ones. I'm very pleased I found Growave as you get so much in the basic package - points, tiering, reward in discounts and cash, referrals, plus wishlists, reviews and instagram integration! It's really intuitive to set up and you have a lot of control to enable you to integrate it with your branding. I was also pleasantly surprised that the support team do all the back end coding for you, leaving you to focus on the front end interface to customise it. The app itself is great, but the cherry on the top is really the support team who go out of their way to help you. They are both proactive and extremely responsive, no question is too small and they always follow up with you to ensure things are working. Alex has even helped me on an issue that turned out to be Shopify wide! And this is why I whole heartedly recommend this product... you can stop looking now, you've found the right app!"
Great customer service . Very easy interface. Would definitely recommend to anyone who need to save a time.
"First of all, professional support team that were able to assist upon all problems we had on our site. Easy to use interface that covers the configurations that we need. I would highly recommend this app!"
"Exactly as described, very easy to use interface, saved over 30% on my images. Would recommend."
"This is a great app. It's extremely useful and versatile. You can pretty much do anything you can think of with this app.
The user interface is well built and easy to use. We were set up and building forms within 5 minutes.
Honestly, the best part has been the support team. They contact you right back and get the issues resolved quickly.
Super awesome app!"
"I like the app but the interface could improve it and make it easier!  works well and meets its goal!  the customer service is perfect and very efficient, they will answer any questions.  I recommend it if you want to import fiex products from aliexpres in your Shopify store"
Amazing app and customer service! the interface is easy to navigate and things are well organized to find them better. Thank you
"Very supportive and helpful staff, despite the app being somewhat confusing. The app interface and UX can be improved."
"Fast, easy, lovely. Thank you so much for coming up with an app this precious and with a fair charging system. Other apps could follow your payment method to improve. Also, this app features an intuitive and very user-friendly interface. Highly recommended even when your images are already compressed (like ours). Peace of mind! Highly recommended, for the Ageless x"
This is a great piece of software that really brings your search facility into the 21st century! It greatly improves to the customer experience when searching for products on your store with a clean and sophisticated interface. The app also collects lots if helpful data that can be used. The ongoing support is very good as well. I would recommend.
"Great App.  For as much as I used it, I saw an important need for the pictures to be in the invoice and her added that in 1 day!  Talk about customer service.  This company listens and has a good simple product with a simple interface."
Good support by the team. Good app and very customizable with a clear interface. Id recommend it to everyone
"This is an unsolicited review.  I'm finally able to get the data that I need to create meaningful recaps and reports for our e-commerce site.
I did e-mail the support team and they got right back to me even during the busy holiday sales week.
The only suggestion I would have is to just add some more ""getting started"" material and create even more standard templates out of the gate.  Also, I think making the user interface more sleek would help tremendously.
I tried other apps that were ""prettier"" but none has offered the functionality and ease of xporter."
A big improvement over the original version with a straightforward user interface. Customer support was also excellent - I received a resolution to my query straight away which was much appreciated as I was up against a launch deadline!
"We used langify to provide a French translation for our Canadian site. Everything just works as advertised, and the interface is nice. Whenever I couldn't figure something out or didn't understand the documentation, their support staff were always fast to respond with knowledgeable and helpful answers. Big shout outs to Sabrina, Michael, and Jerome! I don't know if those are their real names but still!!"
"No other app is doing that on the market, as far as we know, great app with Friendly and Extremely strong  professionnel customer's service !
Exactly what we were looking for added it to our website, interface is great, dashboard is easy to navigate . this one of the best app on shopify !"
CED Commerce's support in getting everything set up right on Google Shopping was incredible. We have switched all of our market interfaces to CED Commerce because of their excellent support.
"Great app. It works exactly as I expected it to, and really improves the user experience in our store. The support team was very responsive (keep in mind that they are on not in the US so their support hours are opposite of ours, but even so they had resolved my problem in less than 24 hours). Thank you!"
"I switched from the Google Channel app to find a way to customize my feed. Easy interface, no mess in the merchant center. Excellent customer service and support, they solve issues in no time. 5 stars +"
"Does the job perfectly. Runs smooth, the interface is easy to use, and the customer service is friendly, very fast and efficient."
"The setup is easy, I should have added this app 2 months ago. I think my favorite app starting now. Its a beautiful interface! I would recommend this 100%."
I enjoyed using the app. The user interface is very simple and hopefully I will be able to scale my business with this app
Nifty interface and easy to use.
"Omega Instant Search has taken our user experience to the next level, and helps to increase sales. I particularly rate how easy it is to implement, and the analytics are very useful, without being overwhelming. With one click you can see what search terms are not returning results, and it is very easy to set up redirects so common search terms that don't align with your product names, will redirect to the product you wish your customer to see.
The search returns for mis-typed searches is very good.
Support has been quick to respond and helpful to answer questions, although it is highly likely you will have no questions as implementation and functionality is quick, easy, and intuitive."
"Perfect user experience. They nailed the required user action flow very nicely and integrated seamlessly with my page. Would have loved it more if widget allowed multiple instances in order to differentiate the number of rows showing in a widget. For ex. If I want to place the widget on the homepage, I would want to show only four rows but if I wanted to embed the widget on a dedicated page I would want to show all rows.
Great app!"
"I've tried other shoppable Instagram apps – this user interface is streamlined and easy for our users, looks great too. Setting it up was cake. Updating the feed is quick and easy. Wish I could give it 6 stars."
Great app and interface. Easy to use and useful features. I really like the apps versatility and creatives.
"This app delivers exactly what it promises - simple to use, clean interface, and easy integration. See for yourself!"
"Very easy to use, really attractive interface, and an elegant solution to the challenge of making Instagram a directly-shoppable channel.  Thank you so much, we are delighted with this terrific app!"
"Omg so happy. I'm only new to Instagram and selling, but this was so easy to use, and get up and running- makes me look so professional.
I love the simplicity of the interface and how I could hook it into Shopify without any issues. Plus the regular updates and FYIs from the team are awesome!"
These guys created a product with an awesome user experience. Seamless set up. They understand Shopify and its users
"The app is simply put a confusing mess. The language explaining the features is really hard to understand. Whoever planned the logic and user experience behind this app did not do a good job. I got a much more clear and concise feeling from the Webkul Booking app.
Support gave me a boilerplate excuse regarding the customisation of my theme to justify not reading the actual question (they have a special page that is supposed to detail what to do on my theme but it isn't up to date).
The features I care the most about (minimum blocks of time) aren't available.
I originally tried the app because of the impressive reviews. I am now doubting that they are real."
"Very complicated and unfriendly interface.
Too hard to set up .
Disappointed. Not recommend at all. If you look for simplicity, try to do it in another place."
"I really, really wanted this app to work. The interface is beautiful and the concept is great. I spent a full work day tinkering with it and playing around with bundles and kept running into small flaws in how the settings (don't) work that made it extremely frustrating. I chatted at length with two of their tech support people. While they were both very friendly and tried to help, they didn't really seem to get the issues and when they did conceded that they didn't have solutions. I really hope they iron these issues out in the future and I'll be happy to try again, but right now I'm super frustrated that I wasted a day on it."
Amazing App. Great interface and really easy to use. This is great Up Sell App. Great for putting all your eggs in on basket.
"A great user experience for the customer, easy to use for store owner!"
"This App is extremly practical to use as you have everything at one place. Before with langify, I sometimes forgot to add the translations because I had to edit those in a different interface. Such faults will not happen anymore. LangShop is very visual and even very easy to use for people who are not into technical stuff. the customer service is stellar. Also during the night or on weekends, they are always there and resolve every problem that might appear. I am very happy with this app and can recommend it without any reserve!"
"We researched a lot of other app developers before deciding to go with Plobal Apps. After reading countless number of reviews, the #1 problem most people complained about was the lack of communication with the other companies. Not with Ali and his team at Plobal Apps though. Like the other reviews have already stated, Plobal Apps do an excellent job at communicating and will often get back to you within hours, if not sooner. The dashboard is very straightforward and easy to use, and integrates very well with the Shopify platform. The best thing about them though is they are constantly looking at ways to improve the app, to ultimately create a better user experience for both us, their clients, and the end user, our customers. Keep up the good work!"
"This is an amazing app that helped us relaunch our couture rental store on shopify's platform. It keeps everything extremely neat, easy to use for customers, clean appearance, and even better behind the scenes interface. No more cycling through countless pages and programs to keep track of our rental schedule. 
The few times we did run into trouble (as we are not coding experts) they helped within minutes of sending in a help desk ticket. MINUTES! You literally cannot find that level of help anywhere in the online world. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a booking app."
"I love this app, very good interface on both mobile and desktop. Have been using it from 2 months it helped me getting lots of upsells in last 60 days. 
Great service, i guess they reply withing 10 mins. 
Thanks for great service."
"Amazing app! Everything works fine and smoothly, well done! Beautiful interface, good support and a lot of currencies with IP location switcher."
"Je connais cette application depuis longtemps et c`est de mieux en mieux. Fonctionne très bien, l`interface est très facile d`utilisation et plusieurs options au choix. De plus le support client est juste parfait et très rapide, toujours prêts a aider si besoin. Merci au support"
Absolutely recommend it. Fast customer support and wonderful user interface. I used to have another review app that would crash or wouldn't load at times. Html coding is something I try to avoid when installing apps and this does it just right no coding needed.
"We rely on this a great app to book events, classes,appointments...pretty much anything for our retail store. 
Easy to customize and schedule anything. 
Even though the interface is very intuitive, if I am ever in a jam and can't figure something out, they reply very quickly."
"I am new to BookThatApp, and I've already found it to be such a time saver, streamlining not only the purchase of classes, but setting them up in my Shopify.  The Zetya support team has been super responsive in helping me through the learning process.  Also, it was brilliant to have a chance to try out the interface before committing."
"Great app. We use it to manage our rental business and the calendar interface and inventory tracking works well. Looking forward to ""independent resources"" in future releases. Good stuff! You have our support."
"Works well and the team is very supportive, seems like they have updated the interface too now which makes things much easier."
"The interface is simple and comfortable.And the developers are very positive to help me solve the problem, thank them very much!"
Great app and a real time saver. Easy Interface. And best part of it is the awesome support team who explain how to set up the store in an understandable and friendly manner!
"Great App. Great new interface, makes setting rates so easy. Special thanks as well to Brian who is always on-hand for support. Cheers"
"I started off using Square a few years ago and it does everything I want it to.  I changed ecommerce host about 4 months ago to Shopify and I love everything about it, apart from the fact that it doesn't interface with Square, so I was having to manually update my Square and Shopify inventory every day which isn't great.  Then I discovered Trunk!  It does it all for me in real time at a cost that is great and well worth it, having taken all the pain out of maintaining my website and shop stock.  Definitely recommend."
"This is a great app. It allows us to set up templates for items with different sizes and shipping availability.
The interface was a bit confusing to begin with as we had a host  of items already on eBay from our previous store using a different integration. The support has been very good in helping me to get everything set-up to convert these listings and now everything is in sync with the new store and running well."
"This app EASILY takes the headache out of trying to figure out the right shipping combinations for your store!  I'm using it with the Teescape app to create custom shipping rates depending on how many t-shirts are ordered and where in the world they are shipping to; couldn't have done it any other way with such simplicity.
The user interface/settings are super simple to navigate and even though it does require Shopify's Real-Time Carrier Rates feature, it's well worth the money. I started on Shopify's monthly basic plan and was already planning to upgrade to annual billing for the cost savings, but when you upgrade to annual billing you can also ask Shopify to give you the Real-Time Carrier Rates feature for free. Some reviewers don't like that this specific feature is needed to use this app, but realistically, any website owner that is seriously planning on being in business for the long run shouldn't mind making that decision anyway. It's a no-brainer when you realize how much this app can make your site's shipping work smarter and not harder."
"best user experience among the apps on the app store and superior support, I dropped an email with my issue and got the response in a timely fashion with the solution"
"We started off slow with Abandoned Cart and now we have just expanded what we trust them with. Great service and excellent support, stunning interface that makes campaigns so easy, really pleased with the service and some excellent results. Could do with glitch reporting."
Clean interface and easy to use. I've had some good success in order recovery with this app
"easy to use, very intuitive interface.
Not code knowledge required, so anyone (even me!!) can use it..."
just started my first clothing brand using apliiq and shopify and so far so great! my goal is to make my brand a million dollar company at the least. apliiq's high quality products and competitive prices aswell as shopify's website design/user interface is a step in the right direction.
Great app interface and customer support. Definitely the best app out there for upselling and product recommendations.
"This is definitely the best upsell/cross sell app. You can easily customize your recommendations which a lot of the apps you can't do. The interface is super easy and intuitive. The customer service is amazing.  They helped customize the look of the widget for me, and even pointed out an issue with my website on some web browsers unrelated to their app so I could report it to Shopify."
The app is useful and well designed with a easy interface. I had a question that was quickly responded to -- customer service is far above average! Thanks!
"This app is very user friendly, the interface is nice and the customer service is great! It would be great if there was further customization- we hope this is something the AfterShip / Automizely team will work on ."
"Incredible support service that goes above and beyond, not only answering questions promptly but making suggestions for how to improve other areas of the site. Easy to navigate interface."
Easy to use and actually free! This interface is super simple to use and you can have it integrated into your shop in less than 2 minutes!
"Excellent app! Support was great in getting the app customized to our template and it looks completely seamless with the site design unlike some of the other apps that do the same thing. Other positives include easy to use back-end interface, and nice customization options on the e-mail notifications. This app is a must for a any store that loses sales from out of stock products."
"This app is awesome!  At first, I was worried about the icon's default size and placement, but that's all completely customizeable, very easily I might add,  through the app's interface.  We've had the app running for about four days and we've already got 55 in-stock notification requests, so people are definitely noticing and using the app.  We were ready to spend several hundred dollars to have our web designers add this functionality to our site, I'm so glad I noticed this app the other day!"
Does what is says on the tin. Easy to use interface. Piece of mind that my site is backed up and easy to restore individual items!
"This app is very great, super easy and simple but very important! Top user interface and great integration;)"
"How many times have you purchased a product or service, then received an email from the founder asking if he could speak to you about your thoughts about the service?   In my years of experience, the answer is a big fat zero.  Mike Potter at Rewind set a whole new standard (in my opinion) in not only listening to his customers, but in actually reaching out and proactively requesting a conversation.
The funny thing is, I am a religious believer in backups.  I subscribe to the old backup joke of ""one is none, and two is one"" when it comes to backup methods.  I had been a subscriber for about a month and was using a bulk editor to make some adjustments to a large volume of products in my store.  As luck would have it, I made an error and messed up about a hundred products.  Rather than sweat it and take the time to key in all the necessary corrections, I chose to ""rewind it"" and it worked fantastically.  The irony of it was, this happened the night before I had agreed to talk to Mike.
As a result, of my user experience with the product and my subsequent conversation with Mike, I am a big supporter of the both the product and the company.  In fact, I also now use their product to backup my Quickbooks Online account."
"This app so far has been great. Simple, easy and fast set up and great interface. Would definitely recommend to anyone on a budget or looking to boost traffic."
"Good app. The interface is easier to navigate. Customer service is excellent. The live support is very useful. Thank you, Prashant for the assistance."
Super easy to use and setup! Great way to add traffic to the site. Easy user interface. Thank you!!!
"It's difficult to leave a review until I've had a need to restore from backup, but I am very pleased with the user experience so far so consider my review for that. Coming from a previous Magento site, the thought of not being able to backup on Shopify was too much - I've seen firsthand the things that can go wrong, especially when adding apps and editing the source code.
While I do think this should be a feature built into Shopify and not something we should have to pay extra for, the app does a good job of showing me what's backed up and when and stays out of the way otherwise. The peace of mind alone is worth the small monthly fee - though if it was any more expensive I'd have reservations.
Back to changing the world, one hammock at a time!

This app is simple to install and has a very easy to use interface.
"I am writing this review as Mike from REWIND is currently helping me resolve a code issue that another APP caused on our site.
First and foremost this company has great communication and support practices.  They truly do care about us Shopify Store owners.  Mike is going through code right now to find a bug that changed layout issues that another APP update caused a new padding shift.  This was very difficult to identify what was causing the problem since all APPs we had have been installed for many months with no issues.
Mike got down to the code and began to figure it out after we first attempted to roll back our theme using their very slick REWIND VAULT function.  Once we realized its not code in our theme, but an outside APP that loads code beyond Shopifies Liquid Theme code we found this issue.  Mike did not have to do this as it was not his problem.  Their REWIND APP does everything you could hope for in a full backup of Website or just specific elements.  You can choose what you want to restore or restore the entire site front to back.... I mean everything or just one piece..... It really is the best APP for sleeping well at night knowing your always backed up safely.
The interface is very easy to understand with a very sleek U/I layout.
What more can I say.... Mike and the REWIND Team have a customer for life and I am grateful to have found this APP knowing all the hard work we do will never be lost.  What is that worth to anyone ?  To me its priceless.
Thank You to everyone from REWIND and a special shout out to Mike.

Thankyou!

"Great app! Amazing support team, helped me with the setup in few minutes. Easy setup and interface. Cool features such as filtration by collection and so on."
"Very easy to setup with a user friendly interface. I am looking forward to see the results, it looks very promising! This app was a lot better than the last app I was trying to use."
"Awesome app. After being in the information technology sector for over 20 years, I have learned the importance of backing up everything you have...from your personal email, photos, software, computer configuration, etc. It is no different for your website. Unlike other platforms which make it easy to backup not only your website structure but the data storage locations in the background, Shopify does not have this capability.
Rewind has solved that issue for us, and now, we have more time to actually work on the graphical interface of our site, instead of spending time manually downloading code for offline backup purposes.

"I hesitated first taking the full version because there is no free trial. So started with another app but faced several issues. Decided to go for the paid version and it is fully worth it. Easy to understand and to manage, the interface is clear and fast. A few questions showed up and the support was fast responding, showing to know what they do. Now practice has to show the performance but we are confident. The result looks inviting."
Great customer support. The mega menu comes in free with only this app. Easy interface to navigate. Makes the website look more professional.Highly recommended!!! 10/10
"I am amazed by the support that Bold team has provided me. I've installed both the product discount and the upsell and requested a couple of ideas to improve user experience of their app on my website. The team was very willing to take those requests and implemented it for me. They also helped me along the way whenever I encountered problems. This is the best support I ever had and they went beyond what was expected of them. Thank you, Bold Team!"
"I used this app to help create a better menu for my website. It worked wonders and gives my customers an easy user friendly interface. Not only this, but I had a problem with the search bar and shopping basket integrating with the menu where my customers could not access them properly. I sent a quick message over to the support staff at smart menu, and they said they would get straight on it. Less than 24 hours went by and they emailed me having completely fixed the issue themselves.
I couldn't recommend an app any better than this! Great idea and great customer service."
"David has been very helpful and informative from the get go of my start-up. He assisted me promptly with my queries and took the initiative to suggest more ideas and contents that can help to increase traffic to my website. Even till today, he's still constantly engaging and help with my site and ways to make it better! The best app I've ever downloaded! Great interface and best staff ever!"
"I have been with Zipify since the beginning and I am very happy this app exists. For a nontech user, their interface with drag and drop page sections is awesome. I also love their templates, specifically designed for e-commerce, and all the funnels I am able to build. The integration with other apps works perfectly. I have integrated Zipify with Klaviyo and works like a charm."
"The support on this app is really great. The interface is intuitive but if you're new to email marketing, they'll help you set up flows and figure things out. Vincent has especially been very helpful."
"The support on this app is really great. The interface is intuitive but if you're new to email marketing, they'll help you set up flows and figure things out. Vincent has especially been very helpful."
"Overall good app, however the much much cheaper ones have so much more the pleasing Graphical UI (user interface) options, including fancy clocks that actually look like it is a deal, rather than just text. I would expect better CSS and styling options, even graphics, from such a OVER PRICED app.
When the sales justifies the cost of this app, I'll go back to the 1.99 a month apps that actually look amazing and do the exact same thing this does. This is a rip off compared to the others out there."
Super easy to use interface and all of the tips and tricks are very helpful! Looking forward to the free time now that I don't have to worry about micromanaging my rewards program!
"I recently purchased this app so I’m learning how to use the software. That said, the support and responsiveness have been great. Bold is open to user feedback and values a positive user experience which means customer satisfaction is a top priority for them.  My experience with them thus far has been that Bold is flexible in working with customers and not married to a rigid rule book. As I move forward I’m happy to continue sharing my experience. Also, one other nice thing is Bold has both good training videos and a support team willing to help out on any areas where you may get stuck. I hope this review helps anyone looking to use Bold apps."
Beautiful app with a simple interface.  Makes following up with my customers easy and effective.  Love that all of my follow-up messages are on brand.
The customer support is GREAT! Very fast responses and the issue I had was solved in no time. The interface of the app is userfriendly.
"I've tried and tried SO MANY email marketing apps and was never fully satisfied - UNTIL NOW. The interface is easy, not too overwhelming. You actually have a lot of freedom to customize your emails which is horrible in most apps (I've tried Omnisend and Klaviyo among many others). AND this app comes with a live chat - which is amazing!! I couldn't figure out right away how to edit the welcome email in the workflow - customer service replied right away and gave me a Demo and I swear I've never felt so excited to start working with an app! Really, really great customer service that even offers customization (e.g. adding fonts - which was always a big issue in other apps because nobody seems to care about how important branding actually is). They also have some great features like a sticky welcome button when users close the email subscription pop up! The app is currently only free because its very new, so I recommend GO FOR IT - because this is the best app you can find on Shopify (believe me, I've tried so many) and we as merchants have the ability to help shape it! I'm one of those people who doesn't like paying for apps, but for this one I would! Thank you Vincent so much for your demo!! You guys will make so many shopify users happy! I'm definitely the happiest person right now!"
"It's a free better version of Loox. I enjoy this much more, and an easier interface as well. 100% recommend this."
The Product Discount App has helped me to effectively manage my sales at https://printedsolid.com/.  One click installation and intuitive interface.  No problems at all.
"This app is a major time saver, with easy to use features and lighting fast support, even during my 30-day trial and now the basic level that I pay for. It comes with pre-built follow-up email sequences and templates that help take the guessing out of my day so I can focus on other more on big picture and creative work that I started my business for. I have 2 young children so the last thing I want to spend time on is to figure out the technology or the right phrases to use on a receipt, coupon, or upset email in the middle of the night. Conversio takes care of of all these things for me. And their ""Sales"" focus emails help me keep my writing short and sweet (vs spending hours on building a similar campaign on Mailchimp campaign). The interface runs smoothly and fast, which I love. Plus their support team are alway very quick to return with to-the-point answers. You will not be disappointed! The generous 30-day free trial was enough for me to see returns. 2 weeks in, I knew I was keeping the app as one of my highest performing Shopify apps."
"Great App and customer support!  So many tools and a simple interface to improve customer engagement, recover abandoned carts, get product reviews, increase customer follow up, etc... Keep it up!"
"Before finding this app on Shopify, I was using another, but I didn’t like the messy interface. Flowio is clean, and very user friendly. The customer service is OUTSTANDING! Vincent has been a FANTASTIC help! He assisted me with setting up pop ups without any question and even took time to walk me through how to use the app! I recommend this app for anyone seeking to streamline their website automation and for those seeking an OUTSTANDING customer service experience! Way to go Flowio!"
"I've used this app in 2 previous businesses and it keeps getting better. We just installed the app in our 3rd businesses and I'm amazed at the improvements since our last implementation. Better UGC interface, better widget, easier method to display customer photos, etc all make this the BEST app for gathering, displaying, and sharing reviews! HIGHLY RECOMMEND! btw, the support is very responsive. shout out to Marcel for customizing how our Page Title was displayed!"
"Coversio is by far the best email marketing app I have used and I have used a lot. With the interface user friendly platform you can't go wrong. Conversio has increased our profits greatly and we have just been leaving that money on the table!! It paid fro itself within the first 3 weeks of having it....I mean you can't deny that...Also the support staff there is amazing, quick to respond and very knowledgeable about their own platform...that's rare nowadays!!! I would recommend this app to anyone in wanting to get started with online E-Com!!"
"Well done app, better than expected and pleasantly surprised.  The real deal! This app makes webpages as if you're designing an email with Mailchimp or Klaviyo, plus includes a ton of proven templates and ideas. I have used a lot of apps and services throughout the years and I can tell the makers of this app have as well because they have clearly made an effort to improve things where other apps fall short.  Simple things to improve workflow and tasks like remembering what colors you use frequently, history recall, automatically saving your custom blocks etc. IMO, the interface and features are better polished in most ways than even Klaviyo or Mailchimp. Just a really well-designed app with a bright future.  I purchased the app for landing page creation, but I've decided that I am going to use it for all my webpages. I'm just waiting for the release coming up in a month or so that will include full product page customization. I also love the idea of being able to slowly change my site one or two pages at a time.  Thank you Ezra and the Zipify Team!"
"The app is good if you wanna customize your popup. A good interface, good builder, and good customer service"
"A very nice support team, they are really pro ! They know easily your problem and solve it really quick. 
And this application have a good user experience."
"Product Discounts App is simply brilliant! Clean, crispy interface that is easy to use and understand, with a whole range of highly sought after features all in the one place. This App will make the epic task of managing sales, discounts & Promos a 5 minute Job. My Theme Responsive 5.1 is pretty complicated theme and Product Discounts installed within 2 mins and I was up and running, ready to create as many discounts/promos as I like. The Support from Bold is very professional, They answered all my emails within an hour and then Helped me out for FREE with a lot of customisation's and tweaks. I am very happy to say that this App will be everything you expect and more, If you are running an online store it is a ""must have"" and after my research and experience using other such Apps, you will not find a better one than this. its well worth the $99.99 fee. The Customer Care is simply excellent, Bold Staff are experienced coders and designers that really know what they are doing, They also offer Design and HTML/CSS custom help etc with your site which is a great help and comfort to know that professionalism like this is literally a click away. I am delighted I finally found such a reliable App for my site."
"Very useful app. The option to schedule your sales is pretty huge. The interface is fairly simple and easy to use. Worked great for us at http://level1productions.com
I rated 4 stars, because I'm still missing a couple things:
- the option to setup one sale where you can pick different prices for different products. Rather then having to make separate sales if some items are $5, $10, $20... off. 
- it should be a little more clear, how to make a sale for an item that's already on sale. (We usually have a big sale day and then push certain items with even lower hourly special prices)
- I wish there was a function to only put certain sizes/colors of one product for sale."
"I struggled for years trying to find the right Shopify theme that will make my pages look clean and professional, and also be optimized for SEO - but now with Zipify Pages all that is taken care of in an easy to use interface. No more struggling! The templates provided make setting up all my pages a breeze and the customer support is second to none. Highly recommend this app."
We are really happy with this app. It met all our requirements & the interface is very user-friendly. The support we have received has been excellent & the developers have been so helpful as we initially needed a few tweaks. Very happy!
"I'm loving this APP! Super easy to use with a great interface. So much better than the other two funnel builders that I waisted weeks of my time because they don't integrate with Shopify! Learning this new APP was a snap, and I finally have my first funnel ready to launch and drive traffic to it! Thanks, Zipify... well worth it, because your APP has saved me loads of time, and the pages are super easy to create as well."
Easy to use interface and great customer service. Jeff killed it for me diagnosing a problem within minutes on something that had been annoying me for hours. Highly recommend!
"Easy to use interface and really helpful support staff! I wish this were more seamlessly integrated with their OCU app; however, it gets the job done :)"
"Not the most intuitive app, but it serves its purpose. It could use some interface updates."
"We've been using Zipify Pages for 2 years. It has a seamless interface with Shopify, allowing us to build sophisticated landing pages and produce product pages to replace the product pages from the Shopify site template we use.
Zipify's support team is excellent: highly responsive and knowledgeable. The developers continue to add useful new features that expand the app's capabilities.
I highly recommend Zipify Pages!"
"I really love this app for it's user interface, ease of use, and takes a lot of time away with its automation (sending of emails to collect reviews and rewarding with coupon codes). The customer service is top notch too! You may check out how our stamped.io review widgets look like on our website: intl.moriofficial.com"
"Very good, simple interface, easy to use. The customer service response is also very prompt, I will recommend it to more people."
"Straight forward user interface with plenty of options to customize. Great looking responsive widgets. Customer support is fast, friendly, and detailed. They have taken care of our custom requests and questions quite well. Would recommend."
"Great app, and even better support. I tried a few different apps before Zipify Pages, and this is the only one that delivered the user experience and outcomes that I was looking for."
"Update: Just to let you know again here we are 2 weeks later and they havent added the feature that is in daily deals WHERE you can deselect a product variant so that item wont go on sale. I can tell you the user interface is very pretty and being able to search for items its pretty robust.  The ONLY downfall I noticed is the product variant for which most people wouldnt care but its big for us since we have a lot of variations.
Yeah im frustrated now.  When using this I should have taken in consideration everything.  For instance with the other app I can NOT put a discount on a certain variation, with this app its all or nothing.  I have to take a star away from them.  The name is true, Product Discount not Product Discounts.  Ill have to wait for them to fix it and go back to my other discount app.
Update: Got an email from either the marketing guy or the owner truly concerned with my mishap.  He offered to help but explained the limitation calls on the API side which I can understand which is another shopify bug i dont see being fixed anytime soon. These dont have graphic images like the other app, kind of a big deal to me and def worth losing a star off of. Used it for a little and I cant tell you that it is very customizeable and its a little easier to select items then its competition.  I went into this thinking it was going to be like the other one but this has more features, you can even search by tag
Oh my my my.  First off I was thinking when they said it was a one time charge its going to beat the hell out of daily-deals.  Let me tell you something.  Yeah no.  It updates SO slow and they even made a post about it blaming it on shopify throttling.  I Can tell you first hand that the app daily deals will get all your sales done in less than 10 minutes.  Why bold doesnt update their feature to use the same script daily deal is beyond me."
"Adii and his team are constantly rolling out new features and adding value to their service. The most recent addition to their repertoire is a newsletter feature that is on-track to replace a lot of the functionality of other paid services such as Mail Chimp.
Very well-done user interface and packed with tons of features all designed to help you convert more customers. There is so much packed into Conversio and at a very reasonable price."
"Great app. We are not using it to its full potential, but for sending a professional receipt. Works very good and easy user interface."
"Really great app with some essential features.
The custom receipts make a big difference and there's a lot of automated marketing.
Highly recommended.
UPDATE:
Conversion has added more features that we have started implementing in our marketing.
The recommendation widgets are really great for conversion. We use them in the product page, cart page, and 404 page.
The advanced search feature (to replace your existing search field) is really ace.
Back-end interface has become sleeker and more user friendly.
Very happy with this app."
"Support team is amazing and the app has seen a huge increase in our sales. I have added and then deleted so many useless apps over the past few years. This is the only one I can seriously vouch for. Great user experience which allows us to make our offers really attractive without having to hire a web developer. Any time I have a question, the support answers in 1 minute unlike most other apps who leave me waiting days. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
"Interface is nice and simple to use, lots of great tips to setup the pages for conversions, and the support team are responsive and very helpful!"
I am glad that I choose this app over the other overpriced apps. The user interface for the app is easy to interact with and learn. They also include countless video tutorials to make sure that you have zero issues using the app and if you do end up having an issue the customer service response time is incredibly fast and they are able to resolve your issues the same day if you communicate well with them. This app will save you countless hours trying to get your products on google merchant center. I am 100% glad that chose this app!
I use this app to create professional landing pages for traffic funnels. The interface is pretty self explanatory and the pages created have been fast and professional.
The setup was a breeze and the interface is nice and simple as well. Gonna keep it in my shop from now on
"Product Discount does exactly what the developer promises. I'll continue using this app to reduce prices of selected products and collections alike. Really like the way Product Discount displays the sale price and the regular price, so visitors can calculate the net savings. I'd recommend this app to anyone who wants to create sales, promotions, discounts, and special offers. Like all Bold apps, the familiar interface makes set-up easy. Thank you, Bold. Keep up the great work."
"I am using the free option and so far works great, the fact that now my customers can receive not only their receipt but also offers, codes and share this with their friends it's already a win. 
Interface very easy to use, clever design, so happy with the product so far, just waiting to get a good excuse (more conversions) to go premium! 
Keep the good work guys!"
"Zipify Pages is one of the Top 3 Apps on Shopify (along with Zipify OCU)! If you do not have all the Zipify Apps, you are leaving TONS of money on the table. It is nice to find a company that specializes in Landing Pages and Sales Funnels for physical product ecommerce stores. I have used every landing page and funnel builder out there; this one is by far the BEST! 
Don’t forget this app was created by Ezra Firestone who sells over $25MM a year with just 1 of his many brands using these exact apps.
With every builder they have their own drawbacks but Zipify is CONSTANTLY adding new features, upgrading their software, and finding ways to improve. Every week it just keeps getting better and better. The just released 5 new amazing page templates on top of the 24 templates they already offered. You can customize any part of the existing templates they offer, or you can create an entire page from scratch. 
I have used many other landing page/ funnel builders, the one I have the most experience with is ClickFunnels. Zipify isn't as customizable as CF is BUT I almost prefer that. CF is so customizable that it is hurting the user experience and the learning curve is HUGE. Be ready to watch hundreds of videos and spending hundreds of hours troubleshooting just to figure out how to get things close to how you want them. It is so much more difficult to use than Shopify and Zipify. With CF it takes me 2-3 hours to design a custom page, while with Zipify I can build a similar page in 30-60 minutes.
Since it is so customizable it makes NOTHING EASY to integrate so everything must be done manually and often you cannot even get things to integrate correctly. This means you must manually add the Facebook Pixel to each page along with manually adding each Pixel event you want to be recorded and how you want it to be triggered. Often you cannot get the FB Pixel to fire the correct events when you want them too and getting the Pixel to record the sale amount is almost impossible. While with Zipify all you need to do is click a box, one and done! 
With CF it does not allow you to fully set your own customized URL, you can select what you want the URL to be but the software redirects to whatever URL they decide they want to use with no say from you. Zipify allows you to set the EXACT URL you want, and it doesn't change unless you change it yourself. 
Another thing is CF is really not set up for Physical Product Ecommerce, there are so many missing features and functions that you will need to get AppTrends which costs $40-160 (depending on your order volume) so you can integrate CF with Shopify just so you can offer the customer’s order numbers and properly manage fulfillment/shipping for the orders. For me this means to would cost me $420 (AppTrends $120 + CF $300) plus the cost of Shopify just to manage my product orders with CF while I can basically get the same thing with Zipify Pages and OCU for $150 (Zipify Pages $100 + Zipify OCU $50) plus the cost of Shopify. That is more than 50% cheaper with better function.
CF does not integrate correctly with PayPal, so your only option is to take Credit Cards only. If you have sold a lot of products you know that with Credit Cards the risk of being scammed by someone using a stolen credit card is greatly increased. Even if it isn't a stolen credit card there is still an increased chance of receiving a chargeback and good luck winning it even if you have a tracking number that shows it was signed for by the Credit Card owner themselves. With PayPal you have Seller Protection so if you have a valid tracking number that shows delivered then you are covered. Many buyers prefer to use PayPal as well. It is much easier for them to pay with PayPal than having to pull out their Credit Card and manually type it in every time they want to buy something, and what if they don't have their Credit Card on them? If they don’t, they likely won't buy and will forget about you. Good luck getting them to come back.
This is just a few of the MANY differences and drawbacks of other software vs Zipify. I do wish Zipify was slightly more customizable, but I will take function over cosmetics any day of the week. As I said above Zipify is constantly working on making their platform better so if it is missing something you want there is an option in the app to request the feature and there is a good chance, they will add it very soon! They also have an AWESOME support team who will help you with anything you need or any question you may have IMMEDIATELY.
So, what are you waiting on? Get the Zipify Apps today! 
(Note: You must visit their website to get the Zipify OneClickUpsell Shopify App, it is not publicly available on the Shopify App Store)"
Very clean interface and smooth launching pages.  I'm very happy with the results so far!  I plan to keep using this app.
"I've been using Receiptful for over a year now and it's hands down the best email marketing app on Shopify.
Very clean interface, easy to use, and most importantly a very effective service. Price is very reasonable and I usually make back the monthly cost in a couple of days due to upsells and abandon cart recovery. The receipts are very clean and professional and the service is constantly updated with new features. They have an outstanding customer service team, very quick and helpful (Adii and Aleana are amazing).
I strongly recommend Receiptful."
"Really easy to use, nice interface and has all the features you need!"
"Excellent templates, fantastic user experience, top-notch support. They made it as self-explanatory as possible without losing the high-quality landing page effect. It is actually the best landing page builder I have ever used so far. Weldone guys!"
"Friendly interface to collect customer reviews with mobile and pc, and support is great. Highly recommend."
"We are very happy with this app. The setup was quick and easy and the interface is very self-explanatory. In case of problems, the support is incredibly quick and reliable. We can highly recommend Stamped.io!"
"Great app. It has a nice interface with plenty of flexibility in features. This app makes having a professional, html designed invoice just a push of a button. I found it easy to arrange and customize the elements on the page using the drag-n-drop interface."
This app is great and exactly what I was looking for. It will take some time to get used to their syntax and interface (name an app where that isn't the case!) and Eric is incredibly helpful. He responds quickly if you have any questions and the Globo team work on getting the app functioning as you need it to. Definitely recommend it for anyone looking to add pre-order functionality to their store!
Amazing customer service. The app interface is very straight forward and easy to use AND customise from a UI perspective.
"App works very well, free setup was quick and easy. Interface is intuitive. Essential app for any store taking preorders."
This is one underdog of an app. it really ups the user interface for your store with social logins and user dashboard. the store credit and integration with klaviyo is perfect. on top of it great customer service and super responsive. 5 stars. would like to see integration with push notifications soon
I have been using Flits for a while now. It has been definitely made it easier for customers to login and create their accounts. Whats great is James and his teams consistent service standards and efforts to improve the user experience. We are now adding the store credit option next. Do visit www.heyzindagi.in to experience Flits in action.
The app word well for showing the user that the item is a pre-order. It doesn't have a very smooth or intuitive admin interface and feels very clunky and confusing to use.
"Very user-friendly interface and quite easy to use,an app that suitable for beginners , thanks for the work!"
"I run a medium sized shop in women post shaving products. For now targeted on the Netherlands and Belgium but I have big plans :) 
As I'm only just starting my e-commerce career I wanted to keep things simple and low risk. So no IT personnel, sitebuilder, separate hosting guy or expensive consultants. Thats why I chose for Shopify, it's simple.
I chose a theme and created my shop.
Then I realised that my theme, like all other themes, Is nothing more than the fundament and If I wanted to build and create beautiful contextual landing pages, smart funnels and longform sales pages I still needed to ask someone to do this for me. Not so simple.... 
It was then that I was made aware of Zipify pages (following Ezra Firestone ofc).
Zipify helps me create beautiful pages (landing, longform, funnel, etc you name it) on my own domain in shopify. 
You can chose out of a couple of pre-made templates or be creative and start from scratch.  Zipify lets me drag and drop pieces of content (text, image, video or dynamic product bocks) in an easy to use web interface. 
It is exactly what I was looking for. I could still do all this stuff by myself and don't need to hire an expensive designer to create and most of all change to optimise. 
You can reorganise, change, add or remove in the matter of a few clicks. You press save, publish and presto!
It now allows to hide or show blocks of content for pc, mobile or tablet. So I can optimise for any device. And keep loading times for mobile under seconds. And I heard it is also going to have an A-B testing feature in the future. It feels like is made by guy's that know what I need.
Now we are back to simple :)
As you can imagine I highly endorse this product!"
"At last, a simple pre-order app for free! Would recommend, definitely. Simple to use, efficient, nice interface."
"Works really well.  I wish the interface was a little cleaner and faster, but it does what it does great!"
superbe application je recommande fortement cette application  l'interface très simple a utiliser je recommande fortement
"So far so good, interface is easy and direct. Just hoping its execution is as advertised. We will find out Friday morning at 12:01am"
"FLITS has been great to work with.  As with any app... some almost do the same things as others.  Flits was free to start which is great for the Reordering and customer management alone.  I was using two other versions of ""store credit"" but they both had not as nice an interface as Flits.
Ultimately, I was going to be stuck using a differnet credit system, because it was the only one that worked with a Store Pick Up Delivery type app.  Yet... Flits came to the rescue last night and was able to get their store credit code to work with the pick ups!
another big bonus for flits?  it's James in Nashville Tenn.  Flits has a built in chat feature in the app and if you have ever tried to get in touch with your app's customer service, you will know how much of a sticking point this can be.  James is always quick to respond and keeps me posted working in the back ground with his team to solve problems.
I couldn't have asked for anything more and it was greatly unexpected with the customer support they have given me.
I am excited and hopeful that Flits continues to add features for our stores, so I can really use it as a 1 stop shop type of app.
best of luck with your platforms - wholesomenova"
The Interface is a bit confusing and can be designed better. However the functionallity is excellent and the service is responding within Minutes and helps to solve issues immediately. Would absolutely recommend!
"I'm happy we selected the Recharge app to use for our subscriptions. Although some things with the customer interface seemed a bit clunky at first, they are aware of those things and are continually making updates to improve the customer UX and corporate interface as well. Their customer service is very responsive and helpful. I appreciate the continual improvements and ease of use. The support articles and resources are very helpful too."
I use this app to help me with abandoned carts. It has helped me a whole lot and boost my sales! Love the interface and the simplicity of it.
"I have used this app for two of my online stores and it is really a great app. Very easy to use (no coding required), simple user interface. If you pay for the upgraded version you get a lot a great features as well. If you need special help and contact their customer service, they are very quick to respond."
"My predecessor had been using Yotpo for about 3 years. When it came time to review, we looked more broadly into our options for 2 websites, I read some great reviews on Stamped. Stamped wound up being hundreds of dollars a month cheaper with a better interface, world class customer service, and many more features than Yotpo offers."
"A very good app with an extremely well designed user interface (quite rare in Shopify apps). Building your own emails is simple, and product recommendations + follow-up emails seems to be worth the premium price. 
We have designed all of our notification emails to look like the Receiptful-emails, so that work seamlessly together. 
The extra order confirmation that is sent from Shopify is slightly annoying, but as long as you use a good copy to make your customer feel special and loved you should be fine. 
Added plus from the clear pdf receipt that is sent with the email, well designed and simple."
"Easy to use, they just updated their user interface too. It's pretty sleek."
The Receipful app is both simple to use and has most of the features I consider important. The user experience and the way you can design nice looking receipts with very few click is simply impressing. Their stats and dashboard is great and their newly included abandoned cart feature is beyond cool. Highly recommended app for any online store.
"This app is a great way to personalize emails for your customers and continue to engage them after each sale.  The app's user interface is extremely easy to use, with plenty of tools to maximize personalization.  Plus, we've seen positive results using Recieptful's upsells.  Many of our customers click back into the store after in their cart using the similar product upsell."
"Like the app and the interface, but my first impression was not the best because:
#1 the ""receipt"" shows up in google's promotions tab
#2 it doesn't automatically disable shopify's receipt notification, so customers are technically getting two receipts, which could lead to confusion"
I used the app to help market and use shopping ads. Had a good time using the interface and create campaigns.
"Working great so far, easy and customizable. The interface took me a minute to figure out but now it's easy. Looks good on my store webpage. And it allowed me to send it to past purchases which I was looking for."
"The interface for this app is far and away the most user friendly I've seen. It's completely idiot-proof and they've mastered the drag-and-drop and click-to-edit. 
I had one question about how to stop Shopify's default receipt (when a customer buys something, they get two receipts; one from Shopify and one from Receiptful). They answered it promptly, but it's impossible to get rid of it. The Receiptful team had a fantastic solution to use their notification template feature to tweak the Shopify receipt and turn it into a thank you note. I use it to give just a little bit of extra info on our products to our customer that would otherwise clutter the receipt.  
Oh! And it's sent to POS customers. So. Freaking. Cool."
Absolutely love this app. The feedback I have received from my customers has been very valuable and I love that it auto assigns them a discount code to get them back to make more purchases within two weeks. This is a must have for any store. The design is slick and the interface is so easy to use. Thanks so much Adii for an amazing and awesome free app to help out our business.
"Pretty good so far. 
Easy interface and it's nice to just let someone else sort that for me as i used to spend a lot of time in google ads."
"I deleted my first review which was a good review because I thought this app was cool...at first. After careful consideration, I changed my mind. They do have a responsive customer service team, I'll give them that; but this app contains pop-up ads (NOW) which was not there six months ago that will lead customers off your website. The apps originally contains the stationary rectangular box ads near the footer of my main web-page which I would expect. However, there are pop-up-ads now; that I did not expect and I recently noticed that it just started happening. My only answer is to perform and uninstall then delete this app. I also noticed that for the last six months when I paid for boost ads, I was getting fraudulent activity that was associated with the six-ads when analyzing the fraudulent activity within my administrative back-end. Also, I never really noticed anything special about this app as it never really helped me where sales are concerned. The other thing I noticed is that the development team makes extreme changes to the back-end user interface and also makes changes to the overall dynamics and inner workings of how the ads behave on my website. If you are deciding to use this app, BEWARE and BE MINDFUL of these changes, because they will have a negative effect on on your user interface on your administrative back-end and more importantly your webstore."
"so far, easy interface, i cant wait to see the traffic this brings to my store! It seems to me this may be the answer i was looking for... free traffic? cant go wrong!"
"Generally it's a fantastic App, however it still feels a little undercooked and as if it's not quite at its potential.
My reason for saying this is the almost entirely based on the flexibility of the Upsell function, which is my primary reason for choosing Receiptful. It would simply be much more beneficial as a user to be able to customise the parameters for each Upsell function more - personalise the discount voucher, giving the options of excluding collections and tags, or conversely only including particular items or collections.
The same with free shipping - including or excluding particular items, collections, tags, and even countries. It's no good giving free shipping to everyone and having all profits chewed up by extra shipping costs to customers overseas. So, just being able to customise countries this applies to would be fantastic.
Otherwise, functionally it is a great App with a great user interface."
"I have recently started to use stamped.io review and reward modules, and so far things are looking promising. A lot of nice features available, and largely self-explanatory and accessible, even for someone without coding experience. A few areas of possible improvement, but I need to have more experience with the app to understand how valuable it is for my user experience. Support has been very helpful and quick to resolve issues."
Very good application and friendly user interface. Easy to set up with a lot of options about the feedback layout and additional actions to get more leads. Highly recommended!!!
"Initially, I didn't believe that receiptful can be that good but it is unbelievably superb, professional receipt with easy to manage admin interface and awesome cross-sell feature
Five stars
Regards"
"Very good customer support, easy to use and install. Very friendly user interface. Good app. We run it on all stores and would recommend to others."
App interface is straight forward and easy to use. Support is quick and responsive! Awesome!
"The interface is not so fluid, I would like to see more editing capabilitiess while creating marketing campaigns."
"I used this app to help me advertise on a budget. Incredible interface, easy to navigate. I am a bit confused as to where to go to see my ads. Like it so far."
"Pros 
I do like this service.  It's free (for now). But they have to make money somehow... I do see them charging I just don't know how much.
They just came out with a new version expanding the way the templates can be customized.
The extra hooks that they give you ( recommended products and offering custom discounts)
Sure beats the plain text emails that shopify gives you.
User interface is great. 
Support  email and docs is great.
Cons
Using this service will result in the users getting a double email. (It's out of their control) as shopify won't allow you to stop their order notification. Support docs of this app will provide a workaround.
I'm not too much a fan of attachments going out in emails. They email a PDF invoice. I would much prefer a link. They say this may be a feature they add.
Conclusion: I'm going to continue to use it. I will wait for the price point to come out and make my decision from there."
"Brilliant idea, execution, and user experience. They did a phenomenal job with Receiptful and the new version is even better!"
Beautiful interface and easy to use.
"Just switched from Shopify Product Reviews and I don't know why I didn't switch sooner! Thanks to extremely attentive and capable support I was able to fully migrate over 200 reviews in just a few hours, and they helped install widgets and badges on product, collection, and homepage. Intuitive interface, excellent functionality, and superior customer service! There is nothing to not love about Stamped.io Product Reviews."
Good App. Gets the job done. The pricing and plans could be better though. Interface and widget is good.
"I've been looking for an app that allows me to customize my order confirmation emails and I've found it (with much more features). Receiptful offers a really easy to use interface and allowed me to create an awesome looking confirmation email to send out to customers. The ability to add ""upsells"" was a huge plus!"
"The design and added user experience this app delivers is one of the best when it comes to quantity break apps.  
But for me the stars of the show are the support team - fast, reliable - got a problem? they'll get it done."
The team has been quick to help with issues I had so far! Been loving the interface! Recommend considering this app when looking for a page builder.
"We tested quite a few apps and all of them had some functionality missing or were ridiculously expensive. This one seems to work very well so far and looks like good value for money. Setup is easy and straightforward, options and interface are simple and user-friendly and the app does what it is supposed to do. Support is great and solved a cosmetic issue I had quickly and with good communication."
Great service! Quick to respond to questions. The user interface is easy to use. Works as described.
this app is awesome!  easy to use and very effective for good user experience.  there was some minor issues no fault of the app and Amit was amazing and help me all the way through.  new updates coming soon including super quick way to link recommended products together.  keep up the good work!
The interface of this app is designed thoughtfully - easy to use / intuitive. Functional and allow us to manage our returns professionally.
"pretty difficult to use, if you are expecting user friendly experience like Shopify theme editor , you will be disappointed. User experience is difficult. simplify it Shogun. Even simple email marketing platforms have better drag and drop function."
"it is very easy to use and has a very basic interface.
I prefer this application for my store over others because I believe that for the user having a simplified interface is essential.
it is also free.
the fact that you can also choose a paid pro package should not be underestimated, which I recommend choosing when you open a store."
Very easy to use and friendly interface. And fast communication with support team is plus. Recommended.
"In my opinion, this is a very good opportunity to quickly resolve the conversion between currencies. It works very fast and is easy to set up in the user interface. What I also like is that it can be placed anywhere on the site. We get it at an affordable price."
"Great app, good customer support The return process is very easy and friendly user interface Thank you"
I used the app and it definitely operates successfully and the setup was quite easy. display and user experience is very professional and friendly
Very effective and clean interface for returning products. Highly recommend it for any business that deals with a lot of returns.
It helps a lot got to know about the additional tool to make the user experience better. it not only help new pages but also existing ones
Great app very responsive customer service and an easy to use customizable interface. I would definitely recommend to people.
"Weglot is a great app that works perfectly with our Shopify Plus stores. The interface is great and easy to operate. Weglot has all you could possible need from a translations tool. Additionally, perfect customer service - Christophe is doing a great job, replying really fast and solving every ticket with great care and knowledge. We highly recommend it!"
"This is the 4th quantity break/tiered discount app I've tried. My first go at it has been super smooth so far, this one is a keeper. The interface is very clean and simple to use. I love the fact that I can easily hide the discount table from the product page as I just want to leave a simple message informing my customers of the discounts. Save some time and try this before checking out other apps."
"Just installed the App, So far it looks good!! App installation was easy and the user-interface looks good too."
"The App is great, I was using Langify but Weglot is on another level. The interface is modern and intuitive and mosgt of all the customer service is always ready to help !"
this app have lots of features and it is very great can help every beginner or professional to improve them store i like it is looking super promise from the app interface and features they have
"We are also using this app on our 2nd website (Medium Plan only). Below my original review for our main website (Large Plan) ---------------------------------------- Best value for money. Other reports apps are so expensive especially when you have multiple websites. Let's be clear, shopify basic stats feature is already amazing buy if you need to export data for your accountant with, ie, payment gateways or exc. VAT amount, you won't have the choice to go with this kind of app. The interface is quiet easy to understand and creating your own report pretty simple with a clear UI to pick the stats you want (you have categories to help you find what you need). Drag and Drop to organise the column of you excel file is cool too, and you can even rename them in the interface. I like the easy to understand feature to schedule and the fact you can send in CSV or EXCEL format + by email, FTP etc. If you pay a little extra to access to the premium version you can even customise /add logic/calculation like in excel but directly in the interface which will avoid you to have to work on your excel file once generated (= fully automatic) The support is also very good and trust me, just tell them what you desire and they will build your first reports. Then, by looking how they did, you can easily build your own reports. This app will follow your needs with endless features. Today we have just customised two reports but we know that if our needs evolve, we already have the tool without paying any extra. Trust me, one of the best reporting app if you feel stuck with shopify reports."

"I tried a few different SEO 'helper' apps before I stumbled across AVADA's SEO Suite. Needless to say, I've stopped searching for a better one now. I find the interface very intuitive and educational. As a solopreneur, it's almost impossible to be 'across' everything there is to learn about eCommerce and digital marketing. There's a reason marketing is a full-time job. AVADA's SEO Suite not only saves me valuable time, it helps me understand metrics that I didn't know I needed."
Didn't like the app at all - seemed to charge for more words that I actually have on my website and so difficult to exclude content from being translated.  Didn't like the interface.  But good customer service though
"The app has an easy to use interface and is able to translate our website into other languages seamlessly. We appreciate the excellent and responsive support team that have helped us in multiple occasions to ensure our translations integrate well with our website, SEO and more!"
"Great app! Does the job very well. The automatic translations saved us a ton of work. The interface is sleek and beautiful, as is the language picker.
What truly sets this app apart is the amazing support. These guys are fast and they go above and beyond expectations! We're really impressed.
A small improvement idea would be to highlight translations that no longer appear on the page, but that's just a minor detail.
All in all, we definitely recommend using this app!"
"This app has a deep report creating interface, it has been very helpful for generating and automating reports. Customer Service is top notch."
"This is a great app - gives a lot of self-service access to data for reporting that is hard to get to within standard shopify interfaces and reports. The scheduler is very valauble, you can reiceve reports to your inbox at regular intervals. 
Most valuable of all is the live help, they've been tremendously helpful to getting us set up and making tweaks as we launch."
"Expensive. The interface is easy to manage and the set up as well. 
Unfortunately, it becomes very expensive quite fast. Also, you cannot download your translations if you want to migrate to another platform."
We needed to convert our existing US based website into a Japan based website. We came across Weglot and found it had very favorable reviews and the interface looked appealing. Our business counterpart in Japan has found this app to be very effective and easy to use. I have found that the support team is very fast to reply and very helpful. Our company highly recommends this app.
"Amazing app that saved my life when I needed to translate my whole store into a different language, the automatic translations also save you a LOT of time, you just have to go through and do some minimal fixes on a few of the translations but the interface is very user-friendly and makes that job an easy one!"
"Great technical support!
The consultation was very quick. Congratulations on the app. Very easy to use, customizable, a very clean and beautiful interface."
"Weglot is an amazing app. The user interface is super simple to use and very intuitive especially with their visual editor. I can see exactly what I'm changing and how it looks like as I change it. Love it.""
Shout out to Samuel for providing excellent customer service. Fixed my issue instantly and even went through the trouble to teach me how to solve the problem!"
easy to connect and user friendly interface for the not so tech savvy user. I would like to get a tutorial on using snapchat ads
"EXCELLENT APP! We are a flower shop and are using it on daily basis to run daily order reports for florists, delivery company and and create shipping labels and card notes for the products!  The interface is slightly old school, but is relatively easy to figure out! And whenever we have a questions or need report customization we  ALWAYS get instant support via chat window FREE of additional charges!"
"We recently installed this app and we are very pleased with its simple and easy to use interface. Christophe responded very quickly to a question we had  and helped us solve the problem right away. Thanks, Weglot!!!"
"What I like the most: the unbelievably fast and friendly service. The team ist really helpful and solves any issues right away. Very unusual. The app itself works fine, but I feel like the interface and usability could use a bit of improvement. At some points I dont find it intuitive enough. But maybe thats just me."
Super I liked it a lot if easy user experience and lets hope it will make me a shit tone of money le
"Good App Easy Interface, no technical skill require to use this app most important its free for startups"
"This is the best translation app that allows you to manually enter translation and change the media (pictures and video in different lanaguage) you want to display when the translations are turned on by our customers. Easy to use interface. They also have the best service; I had a few custom edits and assistance needed, Sebastien on Weglot's team was a tremendous help and looked into every detail for me, always coming up with solutions"
"Great customer service, fast and efficient. Thank you very much Christophe for your patience and support.
Friendly interface
I highly recommend this app."
L'interface est vraiment pratique pour faire des mofications de traduction. En plus l'équipe est super réactive !
"Syncee works really well with a very smooth order-to-delivery integration. The product/supplier search function is very easy to use with many filter alternatives. I have tried many different sourcing apps and Syncee is by far the best. Combined with a very swift and friendly support, Syncee gives an outstanding user experience."
"Intuitive user interface and feature rich application. Generally the best app of its kind. Great customer support which allows for various customisations to be made to each report by the support team.
Would be improved by the addition of UI controls to allow a user to include meta field values on a report by meta field key as opposed to meta field index.
Generally very happy with this app."
"Powerful exporting tool. Fairly priced. Interface is fairly advanced, but they have an extremely helpful and responsive technical support staff to guide you through.
Highly recommend for any business that needs more control and access to their Shopify customer, product, and order data for analytics and external reporting."
"Friendly interface and easy to implement. Also, their Helpdesk is fast and efficient. It really helps us to launch multilanguage e-commerce for Europe."
"I really love this app. It's so easy to use, the interface is great and there are a lot of features to play with.
Overall pretty great."
The service that I've gotten whilst configuring and using this app to increase the user experience for our online store has been awesome...no question is too hard...thanks Jayne F!
"Great app, terrific customer service. Lots of products to choose from, great pricing tool, well-designed interface. Really nothing to complain about."
"i used this app to upgrade my seo and it look like it did it, the interface is simple and very understanble"
"Really good app. Customer Service is great. I can see that the interface is a working progress, but the selection of products is great."
Great interface and easy to set up and use. Highly recommend to anyone interested in improving SEO performance of your website.
"Feasible way to check all your SEO settings, it really enhances your page performace. User interface could be a bit clearer."
"Best app for scheduling order! Not only it has a rookie-friendly interface and setting page, but the technical / customer service team are nice too. It usually solve my problem within 1-2 days. Great job!"
Great customer service and an amazing app for sales. it has a very easy and clear interface to use. defintely recommend
"Fully recommended app, easy to configure, an excellent choice for a friendlier customer interface. And best of all , the currencies conversions are really accurate ones"
Great source of dropship products and user interface - but the 5 stars really comes from the responsive and very helpful customer support
The app seems to do what is needed on a pretty small budget. There are some interface options that are a little confusing but gets the overall job done. I would say the app is worth it if you need a light weight app that is cheap to run reports on various parts of your business.
"Leaky app that takes advantage of problem solving to ask you to put 5 stars. Many many problems (pricing, interfaces not user friendly). They have some ghost suppliers which don't response and they are not able to solve issues with them. I wonder if it is not for their image. A scandal for the price of the subscription"
Great app & easy to use - great user experience with minimalist & clean interface. Pretty self explanatory to use too.
"Richard and Melinda both have been very good at their support. Got everything clarified by them whenever I required it. The app is great. Easy to use interface and the sync works great with the supplier. If you want to dropship from an EU/US supplier, this is the app to go. Thank you."
Easy to use but the interface could do better in the looks department.
"So far so good. The interface is clear, offers looks nice, setting up is easy. Still, need to check out how it works with Oberlo."
"This app is great! Customer service is also fast and efficient; I was having a little issue and the app creators fixed it in no time at all and were very helpful.
It's great not having to think about sending abandoned cart emails - well worth the $5/month!
The interface is easy to use even if you aren't tech savvy, but you can also edit code if you want to tweak the look of your template."
"I used this app in a past few months. Clear and friendly interface. Manual translation works great, do not take much time for small size stores. Few times I got in touch with support team, responce time is fast and staff members are nice and helpful."
"Great app. Helped me add free gifts to cart. At first it was confusing how the app interface is, however, their support team especially Nicolas is AMAZING and quickly helped me through installation. Very easy to use once you learn the first time! highly recommend"
"Really impressed with the support. They are quick and fast and accomodating. The app interface could be improved to be more clean looking and clear, but other than that I recommend this app."
"Trunk does exactly what it says it will do and does it in actual ""real time."" I have been using Stitch for 5 years, and over the past 2 years I have trialed (for up to 3 months each) almost all of the other big players in inventory management software, and none of them sync between channels as fast as Trunk does. The interface is visually very nice to work with, and that is a welcome improvement over most of the other similar apps out there, which feel like you've gone back in time to the Internet circa 1998 - 2002. Well done Trunk! Please keep adding more functionality!"
"I downloaded this app because it's pretty much the only one on the market that has the functionality I was looking for. The reviews were excellent(for good reason) and I took a shot on it. I have experience with apps that have good(probably fake) reviews that are horribly buggy and cumbersome. Trunk works smoothly, flawlessly, doesnt install software on your site and has a very simple user interface(once you play with it a little). Most importantly, I was able to hop on their support site, chat directly with James(multiple times) and he was able to walk me through any questions or concerns I had. If this company had more apps, I would download them all, I have never seen customer service like this from an app, even the big, well established ones. Thanks again for standing behind your work and building a quality piece of software. Game changer for my business."
"The app is working really well, very impressed after being with Linnworks for many years. The support from James has been amazing and the user interface is fantastic."
"Just started using the new interface, will update after more user experience and setting up commerce channel."
Trunk is going to be a godsend for my business. I held off on selling my supplies on multiple venues simply because of the inventory tracking problem. I would have had to hire someone to deal with it on a day-to-day basis. Now I can pay a monthly fee with Trunk to do it all automatically. Been using for a few weeks now with 3 sites linked and so far my experience with the interface has been exceptional. Highly recommend.
"App does what it says it will do, however, I found the interface a bit confusing. When I reached out for customer support for help, I was put in contact with what was supposed to be a real life human except for it was obviously just a very unuseful bot. I would have appreciated if the customer support was upfront about just providing bot support, as it was just a waste of time. Besides that 4.5 star app."
Excellent search engine just added a whole new level to my user experience!
"Cool app, easy to setup with a much nicer interface than the standard shopify search"
Game changer for our site's user experience. This app is amazing.
"Good App with nice interface, although it didn't generate me any revenue (maybe it's my fault).
I've watched most of my visitors though Hotjar and it seems that they get scared from the ""popup"" on mobile and leave my site.
Also, the pricing is just ridiculous. $47 is more than my Shopify store. $47 are all of my apps combined for a month. If it was priced better ($14-19 a month) I was going to give it a go a couple of months more :)"
"Just downloaded it yesterday, hope to see some results! The interface is  very easy  to use."
Software is perfect to interface with Fedex.com SmartPost negotiated rates and allows for the display of these rates during customer checkout!  Min was very quick to get this important functionality up and running for us!!
Quick and easy to install. It even allows you to automatically detect locations for price changes. User-friendly interface and exceptional customer service!
"We have a quite complex range of shipping rates, that would have taken hours  to create in the normal Shopify dashboard. 
In addition we have particular products that have to be shipped at different rates, something that Shopify can't do at all.
This app sorted it easily.
Note that the interface is a page of php code, which could be off-putting for some. However the fact that you can edit the code is exactly what makes this app so useful - it's vastly quicker and more flexible than using the Shopify interface.
Even if you have no experience with php, it's not hard to make small changes like adding a country or adjusting a price. And if you're familiar with javascript, or messing around with Shopify liquid code, you won't have any trouble understanding the if/else statements.
I should add that the developer Min did the initial set up - wrote and installed all the code for our different rates, and quickly corrected a small mistake.
Very happy!"
"THE App works great!  great interface- simple to install- welcoming feature to international customers.  I did have one tiny glitch after installing, however the Autoketing support team have it fixed for me in less than 24hrs!   Very responsive support...and the app is FREE!!  go for it!"
"So far, so good! I tried Stamped.io and Judge.me, and neither worked well / looked great on my Narrative theme. The user interface of Loox is much prettier and easier to use."
"First of all the support is incredible. They are extremely fast and very helpful. I had a lot of questions setting things up but figured it all out with their help. Then, the app is pretty well made. I've worked with translation software in my previous job, like Crowdin or CAT tools. I think langify is pretty well made. It's easy to get an overview of what is translated, what's missing. The interface where you have your original language on the left and the translation on the right is very userfriendly. Custom translations are extremely easy. There's plenty of information in their help center. I'm very satisfied and can only recomment the app so far (it's been about 2-3 weeks that I'm using it a lot)"
Great app. Clear interface with all the options you possibly need. Way more features than I expected since it's free. Definitely recommend using this app for translating your shop. It's complete and user friendly.
"I have been looking for an app to translate my website, tried some before I actually went for Langify. this app compares to nothing I have ever tried before (and believe me I have tried a lot).
I will go into details because I know how much it's important for people looking for a translation app to actually know what Langify is all about.
- It is the number one translation app out there 
-the interface is very easy to use, you just get to mingle around a bit to be familiar with it understand it ( I truly appreciate all  of the hard work you  guys did  to help Us website owners in our needs) 
-I am a VERY PICKY and perfectionist person , and I have showered the support team with my messages, sometimes I just wanted to move an image just 2 mm on the side , they never complained one bit, they did better than what I have expected.
-For those looking for RTL , look no further, this is absolutely the right app to choose.
-even the switcher button I asked for special customization and I was extremely content with the outcome.
Last But not least... to all the team of Langify , Johannes, Wolf, Sabrina, Vera, Francesco, Michael, and Jerome Thank you guys for the amazing work , the beautiful and professional adjustments ,your patience with my requests. THOSE GUYS KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. Professionalism and dedication all the way.

"Langify is easy to use and is a great app for websites that needs translation, the translation user interface is easy for anyone to manoeuvre. Most importantly, the support service of the app is magnificent, staffs are nice and help to me. Definitely recommend to anyone who need a translation for their Shopify website."
Very good app. I used it to translate my site and I am very happy. Very easy and convenient interface. Nice !!!
great service from my boys in the chat and great user experience and design. gonna recommend this to all my boys
"I am impressed with this app and the level of support at Ced commerce. The interface is intuitive, and easy to use. The features are very useful and user friendly, more than expected.
The support is pretty good, it has been a personal, 1 to 1 level, they take the time, and help on a step by step basis with configuring the feeds and optimizing the product data. I recommend this app to people who are serious about growing their ecommerce store."
"This post is more than fantastic! it is really powerful tool to configure easly all your feed´s channels with few clicks! The interface is great, fully customizale with rules and conditions, and lots of useful features are available out of the box! The customer care is really efficient, they will even assist you step by step and helping you out in configuring your feeds the best as possible! 5 stars for you guys, you deeply deserve it.
A must-have app if you´re serious about selling on Google Shopping across multiple countries.
100% recommended!"
"There were some problems incorporating the plugin with my particular theme, but the support was fantastic and they resolved the issue quickly for me. The interface is easy to use, makes the whole process very efficient. Thanks!"
This is an excellent app.  We needed some modification for the app to do exactly what we wanted and the support team was very quick and easy to work with.  The interface is very easy to use and the app developers respond to everything almost immediately. We've had a great experience and highly recommend VIP.
Very clean interfaced app that actually works! Great customer response times and helpful team! Keep up the great work!
Brilliant app for applying quantity prices breaks. Nirav at Bold did a superb job in helping us integrate the app with the Product Options app to give us a really flexible and user friendly interface. Well done Nirav! Top class!
This app is easy to install and the interface is easy to use/understand. Support is very helpful with individual requests and it's really fabulous that it's free. Thanks again.
Thanks to Leizel and team on assisting with the set up discount kits on our website. PickyStory is flexible and has significantly improved the user experience as well as enhanced the efficiency & accuracy of our backend order processing. Keep up the good work!! Mark & the team at KombiLife Australia
"This app appears to have increased the speed of my store. It was not very slow before, not each click loads in the blink of an eye, which can’t be a bad user experience, right?! Would recommend!"
"Customer service is really fast and nice! Abhishek was so helpful and kind in helping me setting up the things as I wanted.
The app seems intuitive and easy to use the same, with a minimalistic interface. For now it works well, just wish it had a little more e-mails available to send monthly in the free plan~
Overall satisfied"
"This app offer many ways of notifying customers. I used the emailing feature for out of stock products.
The interface is very easy to navigate and I was able to customize the design to match my store's look very easily.
Also, the support is amazing. I wanted to import a large list of subscribers and was helped quickly and efficiently."
"Extremely complicated and I could not get it to do what I needed it to do. It probably wouldn't be so complicated if they had useful support articles, or an explanation somewhere of how the app works! The support articles seem to be out of date, at least for the interface I was looking at.
What is a CSP? Why does NOTHING happen when I create a price group? How does install really work? I'm a technical person, but I wrangled with this app for way longer than I expected to. Big waste of time for me. But it might be great for some people who can get it working."
When signed up i was prompted a message from an actual person to help set up the app for my needs. There was a css issue with the backend of my site that prevented other apps from working and the guys at cartbite fixed it in less than 10 minutes. The interface looks great and looking forward to using it more. Definitely would recommend
"I must say that this has to be one of the best fashion drop shipping apps I have ever found! From the products, user interface, and customer service are top notch! Thank you so much!"
"Customer service was very helpful and responded super quick. My challenge is with the customer user interface. It's not intuitive that customers should click on the 'Get Perks' icon in order to access their loyalty account. If I already signed up, I wouldn't need to 'get' perks - I would already have them. Maybe this is something that is fixed in the upgrade plans but for the basic plan, I found it to be counter-intuitive."
I have worked with BOLD extensions over the past two years and the experience has been amazing. The customer pricing extension is no different! The UI is a great intuitive interface that makes the management of our products easy. The robo install was a great addition to the set up option and worked right out of the box. I did have some questions about handling a specific use case and the chat support was stellar in getting me the info I needed. I never worry about anything when I'm going to install a BOLD extension because every encounter with their support team has exceeded my expectation and literally blown me away. Great extensions and even better support!!!
"I have used many apps to aid towards brand operations and aid return on investment - this app offers just that. The Minto app allows you to truly produce professional content at a click of a button. It's truly great value for money and with the upcoming new features even more so. Integration and user interface is super easy. The best part is the customer service and the willingness of the team at every level to go above and beyond, to make the app as beneficial and easy to use as possible. Keep up the good work and look forward to seeing the new features, especially the addition of music."
"Amazing app, easy to set up, easy to navigate with a good user interface. Hopefully this will be useful longterm."
"Just got off a meeting with Jaylene. She was fantastic, energetic and had a stellar answer for each and every one of my questions. Beyond that, Trendsi is the Dropshipping app I have been searching for. The interface is extremely user friendly, the process is super convenient with automatic product integration, and most importantly its priced based off its individual products instead a subscription. A crucial feature that's hard to find elsewhere. Thanks Trendsi, I look forward to doing more business with ya'll in the future. DJW - Leovis LLC Im here to update my review and show some appreciation to Trendsi Support specialist Karen! She's insanely fast at replying and beyond helpful. Thanks again Trendsi, keep up the great work!"
Love Smile's easy interface and plugin to Klaviyo email integration. Plus prompt support when needed so thank you!
"We've been using reviews.io for around 12 months now and it's been wonderful – easy to use interface and daily management, and lots of widgets to choose from. Their support team has copped many questions from us and they've been polite and very helpful on every occasion. Highly recommend this app for people wanting a cost-effective way to use reviews and build customer trust."
Finally a great SEO Blogging solution for Shopify that doesn't need a separate Wordpress install. I like DropInBlog's easy to use interface and the SEO customization options.
I'm loving the interface with shopify and the super fast customer service. Everything about Trendsi is 5 stars.
"Really pleased with the service so far. I'm switching from Trustpilot due to them quadrupling the price of their already expensive service, and Reviews.io have been easy to work with and incredibly helpful so far, and I'm saving money. Their website is much easier to work with than the Trustpilot interface and I feel like I'm getting better customisation options for email templates etc. Adding the code to display reviews on the website is also very easy! Carlus has been a great help, setting up many of the features for me and sorting out all of my queries."
"The interface is very intuitive and easy to use, was able to set up the program very quickly. Great customer service, they are very responsive and helpful."
"What a great app! I wanted to start my own coffee business but didn’t have all the resources to source beans, roast them, ship them etc. This app solves all of those problems! You can design the coffee you want to sell and build a brand pretty easily!  Uncomplicated and easy to use. The developers are quick to respond whenever you have questions as well! If I were to add any suggestion, it would be that the interface is only available for use on a pc and it would be a better user experience if it could be used on a mobile device or tablet. Yes you can make money selling this coffee. I definitely make money using this app!"
"Easy to use, well-designed interface. Looks professional to the customers and helps drive repeated business!"
"Reviews.io has been a wonderful partner to help us build our user-generated content. They have plenty of widgets that fit any design (and can be customized), support is fantastic and fast, and it has a great back-end user interface."
The platform is very easy to use with a nice interface. The team is very helpful. They also are a Googler Review partner and submit our reviews to Google. We noticed a huge improvement in sales by adding reviews to our website and product pages. Conversion went up by .5% and is viewed by all of our customers. I highly recommend reviews.io or similar.
"Pretty good interface, company genuinely seems set up to help a small business like ours. Per the usual, the on-boarding and customer support is mediocre. With better customer support, this tool would be a lot more powerful, which is to say: to make the most of the tool, anticipate figuring out a lot of this on your own regardless of how the app is sold. It must be said, we've been in the middle of a pandemic, so our experience has very likely been impacted by that and perhaps during ""normal"" times the service is excellent, which would make this a five-star product. Though risking an unfair assessment given the context, I'll still say: It's great they're a google partner, but when I asked for help verifying if we were collecting reviews correctly, whether or not we had the right data in our product catalogue for the Google shopping reviews, and exactly WHERE to input the code snippets in our Shopify site, I was simply sent generic, relatively useless how-to articles that I had already found on my own. A support ticket was placed for help inserting the snippet into the shopify site so we would get the stars showing under the product title on product pages, and a week later after following up three times on the Reviews.io support channel, I was told there weren't any product reviews (there were 200+, they simply hadn't looked in a week since we started gathering them) and then sent a link to the code snippet. Pretty useless. So I created a duplicate store and guessed around with where to embed the code snippet, even though I have no experience with code. Was able to figure it out, though mostly thanks to Shopify's simple interface. I have a handful of other changes and optimizations I'd like to make but I'm growing disheartened that we'll get there without a third-party vendor––an expense we can't currently afford. What's more, it will simply be a waiting game of trial-and-error to see if we have our catalogue and reviews collection set up properly to get the stars in our ads. All that said, the platform itself is solid and we've collected over 400 reviews in the past week and it seems like we're at least well on our way to getting the GSR. I can tell there is a lot we can do with this tool but the company doesn't seem to have the support at the moment to help customers with minimal dev experience really thrive."
"I've been using Customer Pricing since May 2015. Generally I'm pretty happy with the app. It is an easy interface for buyers and easy to work with on my end. I use a three-tiered wholesale pricing system which is fairly complicated and the app handles it beautifully.
I don't like that I have to turn the app on and off every time I want to make a product change. It is very slow. And I also don't like that wholesale buyers can purchase something that is out of stock. But other than that it is good. And Bold tells me that they are aware of these two issues and working on them.
The support has been amazing. They helped me install it for free. And they have been quick to answer any question."
"Launched a new site for our e-commerce business that has many different channels, wholesale, direct to consumer, and brick and mortar. Delivering the best user experience was really important to us, and customer pricing app solved a huge problem our business had. Delivering the same user experience our online customers have to our wholesalers. This app is pure gold! Support is great as well, to boot. What more could you ask for!"
"super easy to set up, very clean interface- I'm really excited to use this, it makes giving discounts to loyal customers much easier"
"We love this app. The interface looks seamless on our site, and it's getting great results."
"I couldn't be happier with the app. Setup is a breeze, customer service is exceptional and the app itself is outstanding. It looks great, is super easy to customise and the user experience is unmatched. Yes there are cheaper apps available, but none of them match smile in user experience and functionality"
"I think the app is very intuitive. At first I thought the interface look quite confusing, this after just a couple of minutes I figured out how to use it, and I must say it is super simple and effective. The AI upsell function is awesome!
But I cant find a function where I can show the upsell discount when the offer is shown. It is only possible for me to add the coupon at checkout, which means that the customer want see the discount until checkout. I had some complications with the upsell not showing and also showing multiple places, but support helped me with this.
Over all saticefied."
"Very cool app. Liked the design, the tools and the interface. Lots of options to personalize your upsells"
awesome app just started using it. amazing user interface. I'm just getting started to know it . excited to see the rsults
"This app is very easy to use, has a great user interface & generates really clean, professional looking invoices in a matter of seconds. 
For a digital download store, the invoices do have a lot of information you might not necessarily need but this can be removed very easily with the exception of the shipping rates.
Top level customer service as well, very helpful indeed. Thank you for the great app!"
"Clean and simple interface, resulting in some good engagement on the regular. Would be nice to be able to sort by status though, to prevent active upsells from being buried."
"To the point app. Just do what it says. Easy to use, user friendly interface. Support is also awesome."
This app is almost perfect - just one glaring omission. Why can't customers who are logged into their account download their items from their order page? I know it's possible because both Etsy and Craftsy have that feature. I hope this is something in the works for the future. Otherwise everything is fantastic - great interface and very easy to use.
"TOTAL & UTTER SHIT. 
I process between 30 & 40 orders a day for digital downloads and every day I receive complaints from customers that they have not received the download link. I have contacted support several times and they always say that they don't see a reason why the e-mail was not received. When I look in the app I am finding that every 3rd order is going un-downloaded. I'm having to manually go into the app and re-send the download link, which is sucking up an unacceptable amount of my time, in addition to making my business look terrible. Moreover, I can't resend the download e-mail from the Shopify iPhone app, so I have to wait until I'm at my computer and go into the Shopify admin. A ROYAL PAIN IN THE ASS!!!!  I shouldn't have to pay for an ungraded app just to ensure that my downloads are actually being received!
This software/service was supposed to make my life easier and streamline my work.  Shopify's interface is easier to use and the POS is integrated, but I'm starting to regret not going with 3D-Cart."
"I love the way that Growave integrates my wishlist, loyalty, rewards and feedback and the modules work together to deliver a better user experience than individual apps."
"Its easy to navigate and use. The interface isnt too complex, so even beginners with little understanding of website building can use it"
"We are so glad that we found Growave. Their app is amazing for what is offered. Easy to set up, with lots of function. We use Growave for Loyalty, Wishlist and Instagram galleries. Their dashboard is easy to use and we are able to do basically anything we want with their resources. The Customer Success team is also unparalleled. Any ask we have is never too big or small- from changing fonts and on their interface, to changing icons within our developer theme. They work very fast and are always very friendly. Cannot recommend them enough!"
"This is by far one of the best apps on Shopify. It not only replaces several apps in its functionality, but the user interface is elegantly implemented, and the icing on the cake is the exceptional service, that's always available, it's prompt and hyper-efficient. Two thumbs up to Growave for providing such a great product and service!"
"We use Growave for our social proofing, certain email campaigns and referral that is on-the-way. Their customer support is excellent. The interface is not the easiest to navigate, but for our scale of operation, it is comprehensive and decent value for what it does from Reviews, Referrals, VIP and wishlist-ing."
"The app is working exactly as described. The import process respect stock quantity, variants, pictures, SKUs, warehouses, as if you had created the product in the Shopify backend. We needed some change in the import interface, because of the way we organise our eBay store. We asked help on a weekend, found together a solution and had a developer change the interface for us in less than 24 hours time during the christmas holiday season. Serious people, big thank you."
"Saves a lot of time, that I just simply don't have! So far so good, easy to use interface and I look forward to ranking higher in Google."
This app has so many features!!! User interface is intuitive and their support has been exceptional. They have been able to help in making tweaks and customizations not available by default - all very quickly. Glad we installed it.
Cool app has a pretty easy interface
easy to use. efficient and user-friendly. love the interface and it's very helpful and good. love it!
"I run Tie - Fly Clothing & I recently installed and so far so good, business is slow so no reviews yet but installation was fast. Looking forward to updating you on how it works once sales come in. Interface is also easy to use looking forward to gaining a good reputation."
I love this app!!! This app has saved me both time and money! Awesome and easy to use interface! Keep up the good work!
"Best app to understand why your customers aren't converting, I thought I had a store with fantastic user experience based on my previous shopify stores, but turns out what I learned so far doesn't apply to all stores... For example, the upsell on my cart's page doesn't show on certain devices unless the user scrolls down (and I wanted it to be visible immediately), another example has to do with older age groups (main audience for one of my stores) as they didn't realize there are more images for the product that they can see by simply swiping left or right, this made them keep on changing the variants to view the product in its other colors (it was a problem with a specific theme, so I added a swipe icon on the first image)... At first I thought their monthly price is not within my budget as I didn't need the app often, so I paid $50 for a limited lifetime deal with some other app, only to realize later on that I use it way more often than I originally thought, AND no one masters the app like Lucky Orange starting with its features, functionality, ease of use, speed, and ending with its super amazing support team. Thank you for such a great app :)"
"This is very helpful and a quick addition to our site.  Unfortunately it no longer works with Chrome.  To publish reviews, I have to go through MS-Edge.  It is clunky and slow to load the reviews.  We only have 30ish products so I'm not sure how bad it would be with hundreds.  The interface is pretty straight forward and easy to use and has an easy way to reply to review comments.  Docking it 1 star for Chrome compatibility reasons that are pretty old (reported some time ago), and one star for performance."
"Easiest user interface for applying badges - shocked by the other ones I've tried and how complicated they seemed to make it with unattractive stickers. This one is simple, good looking stickers, easy to use! No issues ""undoing"" the badge and restoring original quality picture. Most impressive is if you request a custom badge/sticker - they actually do it and email you an update and import it into your app. I just did this again with custom ANIMATED badges - literally so cool. I had issues loading once and they emailed to follow up 3x; it is evident they care about customer service. An easy 5 stars and I tried almost every other sticker badge app. Thanks guys!"
"Lucky Orange is the most useful app in terms of understanding user experience and customer behavior on your store. They send me a daily recap email of how many people visited the site, how they navigated there, and where they were located geographically.
The actual app itself is a lot more detailed, and it provides recordings of your customers navigating the site. I've realized a lot of places people were getting hung up or confused because of these recordings. This is invaluable for fine-tuning my customer experience.
I cannot recommend this app enough!"
"This is a completely unacceptable replacement to the previous Barcode Printer app.  It doesn't support the labels I have used for 5 years, and, like every other Shopify update, it adds additional screens and keystrokes to what should be a simple workflow.  The new labels are sloppy and difficult to read, and the user interface is not at all intuitive."
"Please, help me translate ""characters remaining"". This string looks like a modification of the app that is added recently to fronted but forgotten in the admin interface."
"Amazing app and worth every $ imagine you can see LIVE your user browsing your store and monitor every action they do .... this will help a lot to adjust and do changes on your website and evaluate the user experience LIVE or RECORDED ....
Recorded means you can check all video recordings for all userss from any place on earth who visited your store and you can even search and sort videos from each country or by time they spend online.
Last but not least ..... even yyou can see if the customer has viewed a product or add to cart or even purchase .... wow we love this app.
We use this app on a multiple stores and it iss a MUST for startups or even advanced Shopify stores ... 
But be careful it is so addictive more than any other app .... you wake up to check the customer's behavior and sleep while monitoring them .... so addictive ... in a good way of course ... 
i wish there is 7 starts so we can rate at more ..."
"It's very robust, but very complicated to get set up at first. Definitely push to get an account manager up front in order to get quicker response times. Their live chat is helpful and has fairly short response times, but an account manager was a game changer for us. They are still working on adding features and I think our use cases have added significantly to that feature request list. However, they have made exceptions to have their dev team do work arounds to satisfy our needs for things that aren't even available on the app yet. That is very much appreciated and in that way I feel we've received a personalized experience. All in all, I'm glad we made the switch. The user experience is much better than our previous app and a positive and simple user experience is worth any potential growing pains."
This app's support team is quick and helpful! Thanks Keren :) The interface is clean and user-friendly. Great design!
"This is the worst app ever. And not because it's useless, no, the idea is insane. Tracking your site visitors? Who wouldn't want that.
It's ""worst"" tag comes from: 1) Terrible, absolutely horrendous support team
2) Buggy interface
3) Spammy emails (even my email provider counted those as spam, that really says a lot)
My first experience with Lucky Orange, is that it didn't even load  LOL. And support team told me to disable AdBlock, Okay. All the apps that i've tried worked just fine, but your App is so special that it requires me to turn it off. Well fine, doesn't matter (it still sounds fishy af)
Then it turns out that i can't even use what i INSTALLED IT FOR. I was lured in by your, i must admit, great video and photo representation of what the app does. But apparently unless you pay 10$ you can't even use it LOL.
And that Free Trial is one hell of a ClickBait. Because unlike with other apps where shopify acknowledges you have a free trial and charges 0.00$ to start the Free trial. Well,, about that.... Lucky Orange thinks it's the smartest App on the planet and that people won't even notice that in actually it charges you 10$. Maybe they thought that people just won't notice, as they are used to seeing the 0.00$
Contacted their email support, no response. And you know which support team is a horrendous one? The one that never even replies :D (excluding that one time) after that I didn't even bother sending a next email, i just uninstalled this app and tried to forget it like a horrible dream.
But guess what? It just reminded me of it's horrible existence by sending me an email that ""My Trial is ending"" followed up by ""Your trial has ended""  the following day. 
Mind you, the app was only installed for 2 days max as i was waiting for their customer support to get some conscience and reply.
So, if you know everytime you uninstall an app, the trial PAUSES. But somehow Lucky Orange managed to bypass that. 
To sum the review app, i never manged to use the app in the end, so if you  do manage to, ask yourself this. Do you really trust an app that uses some shady practices? Instead of behaving just like any other app and app maker that designed them. 
What else is Lucky Orange doing without us knowing? Well, i won't be that guinea pig, testing it out."
I've been using Shippo since the beginning of 2015 and I literally couldn't be happier that I've stuck with it. Shippo has the best rates compared to any other app and the user interface is very user friendly. I would recommend this to anyone starting a Shopify store.
"Great app, very easy to use interface. If you have any question customer service is super fast and helpful. 5 stars."
"Good Stuff! Excellent app for remind my customers to finish there shopping.
Good user experience for free"
"Awesome app! The customer service has been great! The staff is always ready to help make your Shopify store a success. They are experts at optimizing Google. This app is a must have!
The interface is easy to use, and easily syncs  Microsoft/Bing ads account to my Shopify store."
Very easy to integrate and a solid interface for printing one or bulk labels. Service has also been quick to respond to issues. Highly recommended!
I am not used to using apps much and had a few mental issues about how this one works. I had good support from Milan with the interface to Microsoft Ads and am now more confident in using the app/
"We Love Shippo! It's user friendly, easy to understand interface has streamlined the shipping aspect of our business as well as has helped keep it very organized. Everything you need is just a click of a button away, and it is set up in an order that guides you along and covers all bases without much thinking required on your part :)"
"A time saver from start to finish.  A snap to implement and the clean intuitive interface makes day to day use just as easy.  I would strong recommend to any shop looking to save time and money processing orders.
Update - have had some issues using DHL on Shippo.  When I go to schedule a pick up it never works.  Additionally using their account number to schedule a pick up it says Shippo's credit privileges with Shippo have been suspended.  Support on the issue has been slow and their only suggestion is to go drop off the packages which is very time consuming.  
If you are just using for USPS and domestic I'd say use shippo, but for int'l & DHL steer clear of Shippo."
"I highly recommend Simprosys, the bing shopping feed app and the google shopping feed app. Their applications make setup a lot less complicated, the interface is very easy to use! Support is ALWAYS THEIR TO HELP! That is so important when you're running a business. They have Unbelievable REAL-TIME support! Thank you Simprosys!"
I used this app to help me connect better with my customer and i am very happy with the user experience
"J'ai utilisé cette application pour verifier et gerer mes paniers abandonnés afin d'optimiser leur conversion. Très bonne application simple et facile d'utilisation.Interface fluide ,intuitive très simple à utiliser."
"I wish I had transitioned over to Shippo a year ago; the ease-of-use interface coupled by the savings I have already experienced in regards to postage makes this app a total win-win situation for my company. . .five more stars for customer service, as well. A++++++"
"I've only used Shippo a short time, but I really like this app.  Wish I had downloaded it into my environment much sooner.  Would definitely use it again or recommend to others.  Nice, intuitive interface with Shopify store customer and order data.  Much quicker and easier shipping than linking through Quickbooks, or to various carrier websites directly.  I'm used to paying for USPS postage in advance, so as others here have mentioned, might be nice to have this option in Shippo, but only if it shortens the already fast processing time, or reduces the number of key strokes/mouse clicks needed to create, process, and print labels."
"Shippo is a great app! I've been having hard time with USPS Click & Ship service until I found Shippo. It always works, finds the cheapest rates and allows you to buy shippings in a bulk. Thanks to a good user interface, it's super easy to use. I really recommend it for buying shipments."
"Surprisingly simple, well designed and low cost!  All the things you are looking for in a shipping app. Very well integrated with Shopify- interface simple and well designed."
"Outstanding App, and more importantly excellent customer service. We were using ShipStation, USPS online, stamps.com, and FulfillRite (granted it's a fulfillment service and not apples to apples), but I find the simplicity of this App to be terrific. Most importantly, for those that are shipping low quantities each month the pricing structure is unbeatable. Thanks Shippo, keep it up!!
5/31/14 Update: I can't stress this enough, Shippo has been an absolute dream over these past couple months. The interface is simple, quick, and they keep updating the platform with additional features. The invoice receipts are transparent and prompt. Give them a try and you won't go back to a monthly subscription service. Thanks again!"
"This application is good. Interface is simple and very easy to understand. However buttons go back ""off"" each time, I don't know why."
I used this app to help me with the abandoned cart. Very easy interface to use. I recommend to everybody. The customer service is really helpful
"This app has a simple interface and it's easy to implement onto your site; the paid version is worth it, too."
"Great App with user friendly interface - Thank You!                                                         -Easy to use 
- Simple Drag and Drop :)"
my shop is current not yes running. so far the interface is great. i will give complete review by this week.
"This a great app with a very clean and simple interface, but basically all the options we need available quickly. 
The customer service is phenomenal.  I really like that.  This is where selling meets exciting and fun!"
"So far, I'm very pleased with the app. Easy to use, very intuitive design interface, and great rates. Integrates well with Shopify orders and I appreciate the ability to reprint labels or refund a label if I mistakenly printed on."
"Seamless integration with Shopify and easy to use interface.  Have had a few questions that were answered promptly by either email or the in-app chat feature.  Being able to check rates among carriers saves me a lot of time and hassle (not to mention, money!), and I like being able to reprint the label if I need to.  They're working on a few other value added features that I'll keep an eye out for, but in the meantime the service is doing exactly what I need it to."
"This is a really nice app. Easy interface, simple install and the prices are competitive. No more copy and paste, just click, select carrier, print. You can even select to have your Shopify fulfillment email sent automatically. I highly recommend it for anyone looking to simplify shipping."
I was looking for something to add on my product page to help with consumer confidence - This was an easy to install Shopify App - The interface used to select icons works as described.
"Great app and interface with even better customer service! Easy to find the best rates on carriers and print it out right there. 
There is no better free app for this!"
"I like the user interface, and that the default setting is done for you.  The display of the recovered cart data is also easy to understand.  Good job."
"Better than most paid apps. Loved the user interface, the versatility, and how similar in functionality it is to Amazon's upsell as well."
"I have just set up my first funnel and it was super easy. I was even surprised to have a real person available on the chat to help me with some questions. Yes, it was a real person, and super sweet and friendly. I still have to explore its full potential and so far it has been a really great experience! I am surprised it is free! Thank you for providing an easy to use interface and did I mention it is free? Yes, I am happy. Great job friends at UFE 2.0. Creating a funnel was never that easy. :-)"
Great app lots of functionality great interface with an easy user experience. Recommend for newbies and may you see success with I!
I love this app till now. Clear and simple user interface and these guys are to supportive. Love this app.
"Consistent cart has a very friendly user interface, i really enjoyed how easy it is to setup and use. The email templates have a lot more options than the standard shopify customer emails. I highly recommend this if you want to automate your abandoned cart email sequence."
this app helped me recover so many abandoned carts. One of the best apps out there. Highly recommend . I loved how the interface is super easy to use.
"Great, great App. Very smooth experience setting it up and using its interface. Functionality is great, its just great."
If you're looking for a flexible and easy-to-use discount app. UFE2.0 is one of the best you'll find. Different kinds of discount offers that can be placed in different areas of your site. The interface is clean and easy to understand. But the best part is: the customer service is excellent and very responsive!
"Just downloaded this app, looks great and came highly recommended, the interface is easy to use. So far so good!"
"Great interface. Easy to use, nice emails and increases sales. gives 30 ady offer. so far so good"
"This app is really great! It does many things the competitor apps cannot do. It provides an upsell solution before purchase AND after purchase. And the user interface has a nice modern design. The previous version of UFE needed some improvement, and whenever I contacted their team they always replied quickly. Now there is the new UFE 2 version, it gets even better with more features. Definitely try this app!"
This app has generated so much sales for me. I love the easy interface that allows anybody new to set up thier store!
"Had some problem while setting up the funnel and got their assistance immediately. The customer support is very helpful, friendly and responsive!! The apps interface is very nice and most importantly, it doesn't slow down your website's speed. Highly recommend!! Very good job guys!"
Easy to use interface! Good consolidation of data at dashboard. One stop platform to do multiple tasks
"Application gratuite, l'interface est assez simple et les instructions sont plutôt facile à exécuter"
"This app is really customizable and the user interface is easy to use. When the pop up didn't appear because of another app, I received great customer support in figuring out the problem."
"I wasn't thrilled with this app at first. It makes some pretty significant code changes immediately on being installed, which I wish I was warned about, because not only was my theme not backed up, but it broke several features as well! It was days before I realized my photo galleries were broken. I had to undo the changes by following the installation guide in reverse, luckily this worked. A warning about all the code changes would've been appreciated so I could back up my theme first at least. Test everything on your store after installing to be sure!
On the other hand once I got ahold of the development team they cheerfully made all the fixes I needed for free! So five stars for that effort. The app is javascript heavy so it's difficult to make changes as an amateur.
Their interface is great! The app does everything I need it to."
"I used PushOwl before and paid 20$, but Abandoned Cart Notifications does the same job and the interface is quite easy to use!"
"I strongly recommend this app (Smart Search & Filter) by Searchanise. I reviewed a few apps, but this app is by far better in many aspects such as, it include many features, which are not available in similar apps. User interface is simple and friendly. Support team is awesome...they are fast in resolving issues. Most importantly, the price is reasonable. Thank you Searchanise team for a job well done!"
"Great app! My only complaint is the interface is looking a tad dated and jenky now. Full of wonderful functionality, though! The best app for emails and we are very happy! ^_^ X"
amazing app ... every store need it normal search bar is not helpful with this app you will provide your customers what they are looking immediately very nice interface just hope they improve the appearance with their integration with plobal apps
"Just started using this app a few days ago and still setting it up, though the customer service is excellent - quick and real helpful. The options in this app are marvelous. Installation was easy (and it just worked) and the collection pages are quick to load and easy to navigate/filter through. I'm quite sure this will be an upgrade to our store in terms of user experience! Thanks!"
"This has brought a much nicer user experience to searching through our expanding product range.
The customer support is amazing, with quick response and expert assistance.
We where easily able to implement and adjust to suit our needs Highly recommended."
I'm so grateful for this app. Makes things much easier. Easy to use and clear interface. Make sure your store is taken off password protection before you try to upload your feed code.
"Easy to use, and very simple interface. 
First i took a bit time to navigate but found it very easy. One feedback i would like to give is if some sample emails for one off campaign would be wonderful"
"Great app, the interface is clear and not complicated to follow the instruction! The service client is responding quick! Even though the recovery mail is send fast to the custommer, it would be better to know if he or she open the mail of not. Until now, the recovery cart is no yet provided from the client"
This app actually helped me to get an additional sell just yesterday! Great app and very intuitive interface. I would recommend this to everyone. Well done!
"Really useful app. Well-thought out, easy to use interface. It's great. Great customer service when I've had questions, too."
Great app with great results. The interface is very clean and easy to setup and use. It has brought many customers back...
"I like how the support team interact with me on live chat basis, rather than email. Prompt reply and resolve issues for me, besides. their interface is way better than others of what I tried, user-friendly 100%%!! Recommend. I was selling on 5 platforms and changing inventory made me headache. I'm now using the app to sync my products and orders all in one place at shopify now for my amazon, ebay and walmart marketplace. The team will customize your needs, because my staff do not allow variation in Ebay, and they did that for me! Honest review because really helped me out, saved my energy."
"This app is the perfect solution for our website - I love that I don't have unnecessary product variants, and the interface is incredibly simple to work with. Support is fast, efficient and has always been very patient with my questions."
"Very useful app, interface and dashboard with great usability and precise and fast customer care!
Great job!"
"Awesome support, easy to use interface and no fuss installation - what is not to like? Creates a unified customer journey that does alienate either customer type.  I have tried the other wholesale apps and this is simply the way forward!"
"I just installed this little app and am very impressed.  The app interface is clean and it is easy to use.  Once click installations, you can't go wrong with this app.  Recommend for all!
https://www.kinkytoy.store"
"This is one of the best app, I have came across that helps integrate products on Walmart's Sales channel. Absolutely, love the customer service. My rep helped me out with every single question that I had. This app is a great help to the sellers who want to list their products on Walmart.
Very simple to use, one of the most user- friendly app I have used for integration.
If you get stuck or need assistance the support is impeccable.
The team is always there to assist you out in every possible way being screen share, calls, or WhatsApp.
Explained all the functionalities of App
Abhilash helped me through the whole process and was very patient in correcting my listing on Walmart.
The features provided by the app are really amazing and the simple interface make my work a lot easier.
Highly recommended !!"
"Look no further - 24/7 support, easy integration, friendly interface, great customer service! I took me about 48h and we were up and running. I'm so happy I chose CedCommerce. It must be the best integration app I've seen on Shopify. Thank you!"
"Clean, simple and easy to use interface. Exactly what i needed. Nice help from a quick customer service. Overall 6/5 Stars! Recommend this app to everyone!"
Great customer service provided from the support team. Easy to use interface and a good product overall.
Just started with this app but working very well so far. I like the item mix that is offered compared to other apps that mostly have the same items. This app could benefit with an interface like SKYOU for design.
"Great App,
Extremely intuitive and easy to use interface. Couldn't be happier with. This is the BEST solution for Shopify Push Notifications. 
Thanks FirePush! I will be using this app will each of my clients."
"GemPages really is fantastic... after moving from Weebly (which is a very similar drag and drop interface for building) I was a bit dissapointed with the Shopify way... even after buying 2 different 3rd party themes. Then I discovered GemPages (and no they are not paying me). What a game changer... it really is amazing. And any issues, and I created a lot of issues myself, Ken and the rest of the developers really are spot on. 5 stars all round!"
"Ran into a bit of a snag with the installation but the support team was exceptional! Support (Rhenant) at Yotpo had the install completed in 10 minutes and reviews were showing on my site. Great interface, easy to use for you and your customers."
"I haven't installed app yet because i am using another currently but so far the interface looks polished, the features are rich and support is awesome! Ronel R helped me out greatly. he listened carefully to my request, understood the issue and directed me to the solution. he was very knowledgeable. I am looking forward to a great experience. I will update this review once i get things up and running. we'll its up and running and so far i am very impressed. I am impressed by both the app and the support. Each and everytime I reach our for support they are right there. Happy S recently helped me out and he/she was awesome. thanks! 5/9/22 - as always, YotPo support is awesome. Kenn from tech support was able to resolve my request expediently and efficiently. Kudos to Kenn!"
Great interface. Free shipping is a huge plus!
"Brilliant software and user support, the team is always at hand to help out with any queries we have and implement code changes that go beyond the app's interface in minutes. Couldn't rate them any higher!"
"So far, so good! the interface is great. I have not yet seen the products in real life but they look good on my site."
"I feel very good after using it now, the interface is very tidy, very suitable for novice operation."
"I just got it. Havent tested, but love the interface!"
"Best App on Shopify probably.
I am a professional designer who do not code. But in this project I tried Shopify for the first time and was worried at the beginning because Shopify's drag-and-drop is so poor. Gempages is what you want if you're gonna design it like Wixsite or Squarespace. The interface is very user-friendly and intuitive. You can implemented your design right away without having to learn anything new. The customer service is the best part of this app. Their staffs are so polite, responsive and strongly responsible. The can-do, can-solve attitude is reassuring. There are bugs and complications, but they never blame it on the user's side. They patiently explain what happened by screen caps, codes and videos in the way that is easy to understand. For first time Gempages user. There are a few things to keep in mind before you start using it. I hope Gempages' staff read this and take note to improve the app too. 1. The interface has a minor bug. When you edit the value of Space (Margin/Padding) of an element, they might bounced back and not showing changes at all. You can try switching working for Desktop/Laptop/Tablet/Mobile and reenter the value you want a few times to get it work. In other case just restart the app or your computer. This is frustrating when you use it for the first time. You won't understand what you did wrong. 2. The live-editing window doesn't always show exactly the design it's going to be shown in published page. Half of the time the design moves a bit up and down. You have to published regularly, see it for yourself and adjusted that by intuition. 3. You have 4 platform to customize on! :D And luckily Gempages make this very easy. The margin of an element in platforms can be individually edited. Great function. If you don't code and has a limited bracket of time to fix your website, and has quite a specific design you want to go for, I strongly suggest the 59USD/month plan. Their staff's priority support will speed you up by 50% percent if you properly explain your questions or even requests to add custom codes. You won't regret it."
Excellent customer service. Prompt response with added services that catered to my needs for my website. The interface is easy to use with readily-made templates. You can also create your own pages from scratch. It can be done in 5 minutes if you know how you want your pages to look like.
I have been using firepush for a while. What I love about it is that it's easy to setup and the user experience looks just great. The support team is friendly and replies very quickly.
"Helped me gather reviews and engage with customers, interface is very easy to customize. Customer service is also an A+! I accidentally deleted a product listing and had to move the reviews and CS Jeorge was helpful and was able to fix my issues in no time."
"Excellent support and awesome, flexible interface. We use this app for every subpage on our site. Great app, thank you!"
"My favorite page builder. intuitive interface has everything you need, and always responsive customer service"
"We've been using this app at least 2 years. First, SUPERB customer service - fast and friendly. We use this to augment the site with landing pages incorporated into the main nav. It's easy, but runs best if you are detail-oriented to check your settings (ANY pages on Shopify with heavy images or fancy animations will load your page and reduce speed). So work smart, and the app works even better for you. WAY better than coding your own pages natively in Shopify. There's good looking options here for templates and build-your-own. EXCELLENT options to change what features show on what devices - i.e. you can have video background show on desktop, with an option to turn that off for mobile and show an alternative on mobile. This is excellent for speed and user experience optimization. Their features have improved over time with more and more control. I will say since I have coding experience that goes back decades, I find that coding experience helps to keep the pages optimized and consistent between devices. And coders will always ""get it"" with advanced options. You do NOT need coding experience to use this. I'm just saying it's an advantage with all things digital. If a page is created for our site that is not made by me, I will always go in and ""clean"" it up, since not all drag and drop features appear consistently the best for their devices. This is not a bad thing at all — if anything, it shows the power you have to control how your pages look across all devices. This is a GOOD thing. I'm just giving a tip to pay attention to that when using these templates. Overall excellent app. On my wishlist that I keep begging them for: PLEASE let us create a META image per page, if that is ever possible. Know that GEM pages will pull your Shopify main META image when sharing the link. That is frustrating, so I'm happy to hear about a workaround. But if that's the only bad thing, I'll take it!"
"So far, so good. The user interface is intuitive and the support is great. Looking forward to seeing the capabilities of this app."
Great support ! The interface looks great ! Thank you Kenn T for your reactive support ! Looking forward to discover all features.
"I love GemPages! It allows me to create pages the way I want them to look easily and without needing to code! There are lots of great features and the user experience is pretty self explanatory and easy to use.
Support was also incredibly helpful with an issue that was actually being caused by another app! Within 24 hours, they helped me fix the problem. Highly recommend!"
The user interface is super simple and very easy to use. You can find your way around straight away. The app has a lot of functions and is super easy to use. Great app and great service! Keep it up!
"I used this app to help me set up my drop shipping business on Shopify. My experience was great. If you don't know how to edit code to integrate it into Shopify, the Spreadr team does it for you. The directions are straight forward. The interface is visually appealing and makes your listings look polished."
This app is AMAZING and the service is awesome! I got extremely fast service on a question that I had been trying for a couple hours to troubleshoot myself. I should have asked earlier because Ken was able to fix it for me within minutes. Super user friendly and intuitive interface on the app as well- I've been able to make a lot of pages myself in just a couple hours that I would have otherwise had to hire out.
"This app is awesome!! Finally I've been able to customize my website as I wanted. The interface is super intuitive and you have many design options. They also have their own YouTube channel with a large number of tutorials in which to quickly learn to handle yourself without a problem.
Best of all: Customer service, 10 ! They helped me with all the doubts I have had long the road, leaving my website clean and looking very professional."
"I used this app to create quick blog posts, the user interface is a lot more intuitive and better to use then the regular Shopify blog creator. If I could have any critique it would be to make the text more customizable but overall it gets the job and pretty well for a free app!"
"I got my first landing page set up within just a few minutes. The page-builder interface is intuitive and easy to use. And their support is friendly, informative, and helpful. I'm hoping that in the future, they can add the ability to add a tracking pixel to the header of landing pages, which would be tremendously helpful. But today, it's an excellent product. Thank you! UPDATE: I still love this app. It's a little scary to get a message after a while that you're reaching your page quota. But all you have to do is contact support (available by live chat), and they remove the limit for you. And every contact I've had with support has been positive, encouraging, and helpful. Thank you!"
"Amazing user experience, the page builder is quite easy to navigate. The customer support stuff is A+."
"I tried 3-4 apps for product variant and custom options, but everyone had a problem. One didn't work with discount coupons, another didn't open the cart tray and yet another didn't make it very intuitive on the cart page. I found Infinite Options to be really useful, and it takes care of all our needs as a modern store. Very simple user interface to add/edit options and works like a charm. I took the team's help for configuration, and they did an amazing job in a single working day. Thanks a lot, friends, and keep it up! Best Regards,
Sanchit"
"so far so good! super impressed with the support, interface, price (free?? wow!) and that I won't lose reviews when I change my theme. Excited to import my reviews and leverage this to increase business!"
Great Customer Support from their side. Their interface is so easy to use and easy to edit all kind of reviews.
"Very easy to use, interface is clear and options self explanatory. Robust features, leaves little to be desired. Extremely friendly and helpful support staff. Would use again!"
It’s not possible to translate the user interface of the app. The chat appears to customers always in English so it’s only useful for shops in English.
Postscript has increased our sales by 100% in the last 3 months. The customer service is great and the interface is very easy to navigate. Highly recommend!
So far this app has been a lifesaver. Super friendly user experience and easy to pick up. Customer service is also top-notch. We've seen conversions in just a few days. Any issue I've run into Michael has been able to resolve in just minutes. Couldn't recommend it enough!
"Intuitive interface and quick customer service.
Had some issues but after sending a email the team resolved my problem within a day."
Easy to setup. Good features with modern interface styling. Fitted the requirements precisely straight out of the box. Thanks
"UPDATE: It is rare to find a talented group of developers working so hard for customer satisfaction. Implementing a critical feature required considerable effort on my part with guidance of Hulkapps. When I was done, they stepped in to make their integration as beautiful as it is functional. I am proud to say that IPO is now a cornerstone of the ClinicalPosters website.
Previous May 5, 2020 review:
Good user interface. IPO appears to be best suited for stores with either few products or many products with few options. The current version lacks a product image overlay feature that I am currently using extensively in another app. So I must put IPO on the back burner until their brilliant minds figure it out. I continue to use other HulkApps though."
"Super App! Funktioniert einwandfrei und toller Support! Ich war schon lange auf der Suche nach einer einfachen App zur DHL Anbindung, da die offizielle DHL App mehr bugs hat als Funktionen und zudem ein sehr schlechtes Interface besitzt. 
Die App zeigt, wie es richtig geht! Ich werde die App jedem weiter empfehlen, vielen Dank!"
"I used this app to be able to have a custom dropdown box with multiple fields and hundreds of options on our listings. This was not possible on shopify as standard. This app blew me out of the water. Very easy to learn to use and even has a nicer interface on the product page compared to similar apps competitors. Also, you can set one 'option' to cover multiple pages. This feature has saved us so much time! I did try out another app alongside this one, The most popular free app to give you the same options.(if you found this app, you most likely found that one also) The other app was full of problems and couldn't do what I needed in the back end. I contacted both the ShopPad support and the free app support during my research phase.
Free app support: we can't do anything to help you, here click this link to pay a developer to look into this for you for a fee to create custom code. ShopPad support: The problem was 'X' 'Y' and 'Z', here is how to resolve it, here are screenshots of the part you need to change. Let us know if you need more help. I actually made a mistake with my settings and the ShopPad support let me know before I even realized it was a problem. I also use Mesa from ShopPad to import the infinite Options data into a google sheet as soon as I receive an order. These apps work a charm. If you take your business serious at all, invest your time and money into ShopPad apps, their customer support is by far the best support I have ever received and the apps are very reliable. In this world, you really do get what you pay for. Any money you save with the free option you will repay with stress. I've looked through every related app on the store and this is the best for function and support."
"Great app! Set up my first pop up and chat popped up with help from One team to optimise it, thank you Rosy! Fab help. Rosy went above and beyond to help me understand something else on Shopify too! :) Impressed with the editing capabilities and easy interface. Thanks team!"
Great app and great support! We got much more sales from messenger remarketing than from emails! Nice interface and easy to use. Thank You!
"It took me forever to find the app that I needed for my store. I am so happy with it. So simple yet it's everything I wanted. Very easy to set up even though I had trouble doing it myself, they were quick to get it installed for me. The feedback I have had from my customers is great. They shop by size, so having it displayed on the homepage makes their experience easier and quicker. If you have a clothing store or something similar, I highly recommend this app. The price is worth user experience and I've had an increase in the time spent on my collection pages and a lower bounce rate because customers can see what's available before clicking on the item, waiting for the page to load, selecting their size, seeing whether its available then if it's not, having to go back, re load the collection page and keep scrolling."
"This app is way better than the other similar all in one app. I have tried both and i like the user interface of this app better because it is layman friendly. 
Add to that the fantastic and quick support. Mohit went over and above to help me with my issue.
The price point is great for the amount of stuff provided. 
Besides being happy, i am just extremely thankful for the existence of this app as it has made life easy for a first time eCommerce business aspirant."
"After spending days looking for sales bundle and trying about 5 different apps without success (errors, support not getting back to you, interface looks like it was from the 90s) I happen to stumble upon this.  IT DOES SO MUCH COMPARED TO THE OTHER APPS ON THE MARKET.  I did run into some issues at the start and they fixed it up with the quickness.  You have to download this!!!!!!!"
"Some good products and great interface. The bad is some vendors don't ship when they say they are going to ship, and they don't respond to emails.  So select vendors at your own risk. Also be careful of counterfeit products, there are many that are counterfeit.  I had to stop using the app because the vendors were so bad at shipping. It's too bad I was getting a lot of sales too."
"I have used this app for my store for about 2 months now.  $425 spend, and $12,500 in return.  GREAT ROI right?  Well, if this was accurate, that would be the case.   However, I know from crunching the numbers that this is not correct.  I thought maybe this was measuring Click Through AND View Through Conversions (the app never specifies anywhere on the site which attribution model it uses, which can be misleading).  I decided to message the founder of the app.
He messaged me and said RetargetApp only measures Click Through Conversions.  Now this is where I KNOW this is off.  I can see the UTM campaign on my Shopify store, and this means that 1% of my traffic is bringing almost 20% of my revenue.  (So basically I was either lied to, or the maker of the app himself is also misled, which I struggle to believe)
The oversimplification of the app causes me some distress.  As a numbers guy, there is no way to measure this in the slightest, and test different variations or cross examine different retarget platforms.  Also, since the revenue/profit it gives you is not accurate, the numbers yield relatively useless.  If the owner knows that the numbers are not 100% accurate (which based off other reviews, he apparently does), this needs to be stated clearly in the app, or maybe taken off the store until it is fixed.  
TL;DR ::  Developer is not up front about the accuracy of the ""revenue"" metric within the app.  Interface is over simplified.  No way to really measure anything useful. Good if you are new to retargeting, but pay no attention to the numbers except the ""spend"" metric, because it means very little,"
"A good straightforward solution. One of the few that allows ""custom"" rewards. Configuration is clear. I needed some specific support for my requirements and Derek was really fast and helpful. He was able to signpost me to areas of the admin interface, where you get a little more functionality to edit the templates. Hugely helpful."
"This app works intermittently, when it works, works well. User friendly interface, integrated fine with other apps I use.
The Global Online Shop."
"We use the Bulk Product Edit & CSV Import app by Hextom to update product information such as tags, prices, weights and variant titles. This app is the absolute best around with an amazingly easy to use interface. The CSV import feature is also best in class and makes bulk updates so easy that it takes almost the same amount of time to edit thousands of products as it would take you to make one change to a single product within Shopify. No app can be 5 star without incredible customer service, and Hextom knows all about providing amazing service. I contacted them about adding the variant title as an editable field through their CSV import tool and not only did they accommodate my request, they worked throughout the weekend to make it happen so that I would be able to do my updates on Monday.  I didn't even have to ask!  Allan at Hextom provided me with the type of customer service that I have always wanted, but seldom receive.  I highly recommend this app and the company behind it :)"
"I signed up for this app to set up an affiliate link. The user interface is fairly intuitive, but it did require me to reach out to support to clarify how the link works and to whom it is sent out. It defaulted to be sent out automatically to anyone who make a purchase on our site, which I thought was odd. However, their customer service was excellent. The gal who helped me, Benz, was super thorough and patient and explained everything very clearly and even followed up with a very detailed email."
"very good app.
very fast and diligen customer service
incredible user interface
great zapier integration.
Should have a google sheet integration"
I use this app to get feedback from my customers. Its a great free app that works perfectly for my store. It has different formats that we can chose from and the interface is quite simple and user friendly.
The customer interface is very intuitive and their customer support is great! I had a difficult request for their team and Jon helped us pull it off with ease.
"This is a serious app. The only right bulk editing app with every feature imaginable. Like replace part of description, edit every option of the product or collections etc.  If you can imagine it they can do it. The user experience and quality of software is also great unlike many apps on the app store."
Very well thought out app. Easy and practical features. I've had a really good user experience with it. The best form builder I've tried so far with beyond amazing customer service. Highly recommend. A++++
"WOW ! , Where has this app been all of my internet marketing life ?   I failed many times trying online promotions . Now after meeting Modalyst app, things are starting to get so much better . This app can even be used by a caveman . Very user and eye friendly interface , with all the considerate moderators ready to speed to your rescue . This is a great day for me . Thank you Modalyst for existing ..."
I used this app to improve my mobile site loading speed and adwords rank ratings. The interface was really easy to use and had a lot of options. The pricing is good and I got a LOT of help from the livechat this app had. They were really kind to help me with all the questions I had! Highly recommend.
"SIMPLY AMAZING!  I just started using this app today and Mark and Stephen were so prompt, responsive, and helpful in troubleshooting out with an issue I had.  Really nice looking app, offers a lot more features than the main competitors I have seen to this and the interface is waaaaaaaay better!  Keep up the great work guys!"
Nice clean and easy to use interface - makes updating your SEO meta titles and descriptions much faster.  Highly recommended.
"The interface is easy to use. Amazing customer service, Esther resolved an issue within minutes. Thank you!"
Interface is user friendly. Makes for nicely made product pages on the free plan. One caveat to amp (unrelated to the app though): the pages need time to be indexed by Google (consider 2 weeks). So patience is a virtue
"Super easy to AMP your store with a simple interface,
a very very good customer care service 
Thanks a lot"
"Easy-to-use interface with simple ways to fix basic issues, very helpful staff who helped with setting up. Quick response time"
"This is not just the BEST App we've downloaded, it also has the BEST customer service. This is a slick solution with a beyond-user-friendly interface that can only improve your Shopify store by bringing it up to speed with all AMP requirements. If there are any app of the year awards, AMP by Shop Sheriff needs to win. Thank you for putting such a great solution together and how generous to let it be free. Highly recommended +++++"
"I have been recently using this app with my site and it does exactly what it says. The interface is quite simple and straightforward, making it easy to make adjustments to the look of your pages and seamlessly load products.
I had a few hiccups, as expected with any new app, and the developer has been one of THE MOST helpful people  I've ever worked with. Definitely was not expecting any support with a free app, but I was wrong. He walked me through every step and took initiative to troubleshoot and ensure things worked smoothly with my site on his own time. 
This app is truly a gem and the best part is the incredible developer/development team behind this project. You don't get support like that from PAID apps these days, so this is something special and best of all gets the job done."
I love the easy-to-use interface and the responsiveness of the support team. It helped me out at the beginning of my business journey. I highly recommend trying it out.
"Used this app for inserting trust badges and showing sales on my store. It works really great, the interface is user-friendly and easy to navigate. Thanks to Marcus and Drake for their quick response! Highly recommend!"
"5 stars well deserved! Easy and user-friendly interface, competitive prices but most of all great support service - reactive and helpful!"
"The interface is so confusing to work with, but when you finally figure it out, then it's worthed. Be prepared for bunch of headache."
"Nice interface, seems easy enough, I do hope it comes with results though.
Will update soon about the progress."
"Love Easy Ship! Great rates, an amazing team to help with any questions, and a super simple to use interface. I love using easyship to get my products to my customers!"
"Do not like the interface that much , but it does deliver what it promised. So still give a 5. The functionality of it is what it matters."
"It is an incredible app! For such a price you can't do anything wrong. It's has everything to start with SEO: Good looking Interface, easy to use options and it's structuring SEO like magic: without slowing down your Shop and make google happy like a child after a candy shop visit. Also, the Service is awesome."
Installed this app recently and I love the simple yet complete interface. It is already helping me achieve my SEO goals.
"It looks really pleasing with the new interface. All features are clearly now, of course it did before. But I prefer the current one. I just installed days, will try more."
"I needed a simple app to add sale labels to my products. This app was easy to setup and worked without having to get help. There are many customization options, even with the free version. Interfaced with support a couple of times and they were quick to respond to my questions. See it in action at www.packturtle.com.
Click on one of our sale banners at the top and you can see our sale labels on the product images."
"Great tool with a very intuitive and clear interface to configure. Also, excellent costumer atention, fast and reliable!"
"Simple and useful.
Nice service and nice interface.
5 stars!
Minimum 100 characters is too much for me!"
Just downloaded this apps and the support team is very helpful and supportive. Apps interface is cool and user friendly.
Very prompt and helpful support. I preferred the app prior to their most recent changes as currently the base plan is quite restrictive. Their interface is fairly easy to use and I like the csv import capability.
"I really recommend this app for everyone looking for an app to link related products as swatches on product pages. I dont use the native shopify ""variant"" for different colors of my clothing of the same style - I like to keep them as separate products with their own collection position and their own individual product page. This way I can maximize SEO for each page and also increase internal linking. With this app you can do that - and also beautifully link products as if they where variants of each other. Support is really good and responsive (fast!) and I havent actually found another app in app store that does this. some page speed is sacrificed but I think its worth it for the user experience✌️"
"Update: I've adjusted my review from 5 to 3 star because I've had two open issues/errors with Star Apps and this specific app for the past +2 months. I have tried reaching out to Star Apps 3-4 times on e-mail to get an update. No response and no progress on the issues. It's quite disappointing since this is something affecting my customers' user experience. Original review; I have been looking for something like this app for sooo long. It does exactly what I need (show variants in a nice way AND even connects similar product so they show up like variants). The only negative thing I have to say is that I WISH I HAD FOUND IT SOONER. I'm sure I lost a lot of customers because of not having this app. Better late than never. THANKS to the dev. team for their superb support, kindness, and for developing this APP at a reasonable cost."
I used this app to give customers a better user experience by switching from my themes drop-down menu for selecting variants to custom swatches and pictures and the support is incredibly responsive!
Clean and easy to use interface. Does exactly as advertised. Recommended!
"I just wanted to say that this app is absolutely fabulous. I love the interface and the customer service is superb. It's so user-friendly and easy to navigate with a great selection of video tutorials and very detailed help docs. I have tried a handful of subscription apps and none of them compare. Appstle is hands down the best subscription app around. I will be using this app forever, and I have no doubt my subscribers will love it too! Thank you so much for creating such a wonderful product for everyone to use."
An easy User Interface which helped in creating a customized Form Builder to our requirement for our website
"You get what you pay for!  I had tried a few free gallery apps and it was a disaster.  Days of work lost.  So I decided to give this a try.  An incredible, unbeatable buy for the money.  Outstanding capabilities, clean, fresh, and easy to use interface, and a gallery that looks and functions great for an incredible price.  And the support!  And problems we've had have either been solved within minutes or at worst overnight.  They are responsive, polite, intelligent, and great to work with.  
Just use the app.  Its awesome."
"This really simplified filling and updating our product description.
We can create different tabs with different titles with ease and really streamlined and have a simplified tab for every product.
The interface is clean, easy to use, and straight-forward.
Integrating to a customized theme may take you a couple of attempts, but disabling / enabling under the Settings > Theme manager > Actions > Disable / Enable a couple of times did the trick.
This can be really helpful and of great value for companies in their growth stage."
"After going through many other crappy & dysfunctional tab apps here on Shopify app store, I am finally relieved to have found a tab app that actually lives up to its hype! 
1. Affordable, super easy to setup and install.
2. Design functionality & interface is perfect.
3. Love that you can have several options & presets for how you want your tabs displayed on your product description.
4. Mobile friendly (which is a huge plus in my book seeing as how other tab apps on here are not mobile friendly even though they claim to be)
This is the BEST tabs app on Shopify app store in my opinion. And I would highly recommend it to anyone :-) Definitely worth the money!"
"I have been using a different tabs app, but the interface and so was a bit ""clunky"" and outdated. Now i found this tabs app instead, and its just SO much better.
Many options to customize the tabs, how it should look and so on. Integrates neatly into your theme, and if you should run into any issues, their support is perfect.
I can highly recommend this app to anyone who needs tabs for product descriptions, other information or whatever it could be! Its VERY good."
Very easy to use interface! Easy to customize. Love the app. And it's affordable too. Highly recommended!
Easy to install. Clean interface. Great app!
"Superb app. Easy Install. Clean interface. Simple understanding of how to use.
Must have."
The setup with the pagefly integration was easy and quick and the interface is intuitive and works well. When facing issues the support team answered quickly and put everything into place in the matter of moments. I would definitely recommend this app.
"We reviewed a number of  tab apps and tried using one of them and unfortunately ran into a number of problems (user interface being one of them). So happy we came across this tab app by Station! User interface looks clean and organized, it's super easy to set it up and the back end portion of the app is very easy to navigate!! Oh, and Meghan at customer support is a super star and gets back to you very fast! 
Check out www.armoniia.com to see how this app looks in action."
"Well that was simple! Such an easy, well guided app to use. Clean interface and simple to add to your site. Thoroughly recommend this as a countdown timer app!"
"The best multi-platform chatting and messaging app on Shopify. Period.
We are into customized corporate trophies and awards. Our clients need to interact during the closure of sales due to the customization element involved. We tried a couple of other apps for chat available here, but honestly the learning curve was steep for us and for our clients as well.
We came across WhatsHelp Chat Button, initially we were skeptical thinking...here we go again! Honestly going through the app page on Shopify and reading the reviews, we were a little confused regarding its pricing structure, while it says its free, one of the reviewers' comment of 1000 chats only being free was kind of a deal breaker for us, however, we contacted them on FB messenger and after explaining our concerns to them we were clarified that the pricing structure was for installing their api on native self managed sites and its was FREE for Shopify users!
Convinced, we installed it (which is a breeze, if anything), and it was up and running instantaneously. The guys at the help desk were only too kind to help customize the chat button color to our brand color and we are stoked about introducing our clients to this new and user friendly interface.
Superb app. The best chat app on Shopify in our opinion.
All the best for future apps guys. Keep them coming and keep them free :-)

"Easy and Simple. Adds a lot of value and potential for growth for my business, would love a tutorial on how to maximize the app interface."
Honestly for the last 30 minute i tried different countdown timer app.. i was struggling!!!!! they are juste too complicated and not really good looking. with CTB my countdown timer was set in less than 5min. the interface is very clear easy to use! i recommend it!!!
I liked their support team who respond quickly in case there is any question or difficulty. Good interface and highly recommended.
Set up is easy. Friendly user experience. Quick and helpful customer service when we had questions.
"Reliable, Fast & Secure Software
Ezyslips have saved our lot of time by providing us with a nice tool to print shipping labels in bulk, generate GST invoices and create custom alerts. Easy to set up and have a user-friendly interface."
"Easy to use interface and their customer support team is always ready to answer your query with full satisfaction. Overall a great experience with Ezyslips. 
Satisfied with the services"
We have a great experience with this interface. It helps in many ways like from assigning waybill number to data management. Thanks for a such great portal and support.
"I am using this app from past few months and ,This app is very good and convenient to go for and makes task much easier , it has an excellent user interface."
I enjoyed utilizing this app. A little confusing to get my head around the interface at first but once I got used to it there was nothing difficult about setting up. Thanks!
"From last one year we are using the EZYSLIPS, and this is the best portal to manage your courier services. It has friendly interface which allows you to book the order so easily."
"This App is a must have, Helps sell products effortlessly and does exactly what it says on the tin! Looks great, feels great, has a crispy feel to the interface and is simple to use, actually its probably too easy to use! Plus the customer service here is fantastic so if you for some strange reason run in to trouble with any of POWr Apps these guys will have you back up and running in no time.  5 Star App, AAA+++"
"I've just started using exportfeed in the last couple of months.  I'm very impressed with their customer support:  timely, helpful, and creative.  They were very willing to support and help me with their app.  as I'm trying to expand my store platforms.  I purchased it for FB shop and Bonanza. As has been stated previously, the Bonanza interface is not available now, however,  this is the first FB shop feed that I've used that wasn't nightmarish--the last two erased my  current FB shop, put in a new in instead with click out--not what I wanted--this app. will put your products right into an existing store on FB and not touch anything there.   YAY!  I can't speak to the other platforms,   but for the one I'm using it seems quite intuitive and it will make it easy for me to keep my store inventory updated as it should--most importantly, my customers can check out on FB--which is very important whereas they are waiving selling fees over there for a few month.  Good app; easy to use, and great customer service from the team!"
"Software works well, and does what we needed with minimal setup. 
We were able to customize the interface with local Japanese text.
Their support team are helpful and responsive."
So far so goood! Great user experience.
"I'm looking for an app to automate cross listing items to etsy. This app is pretty bad. The first upload was clumsy but it did get everything over to etsy. Everything was mis-categorized so I had to go manually change the age of the others. But after that initial upload, nothing updated. It's a terrible interface and doesn't seem to even update anyway. 
Update: They have reached out me to try to update things to work better so I am trying it again and will update my review."
I have been using ActiveCampaign for 6 months. I have used many different email sending services and this has the best interface. It is the best one I have used so far.
"This is a big step up in utility, complexity, granularity and (most importantly) ROI from our last email marketing tool. As sophisticated and robust as automations are the interface is reasonably intuitive, and support has been excellent with trouble-shooting. We've not gotten close to the limits of what AC can do, which strangely makes us wonder if what we have managed to map out is indeed the best, most efficient way to get to across any goal line. So, there may be a few redundancies in our automations, but they still work just fine so we've stopped being afraid to wade in and add actions and conditions."
"ActiveCampaign has done a great job reorganizing our customer database, as well as putting together clean emails. We recently migrated from Omnisend to ActiveCampaign for the premium customer databasing, among other features recommended to us. The email building interface is a little more challenging to navigate than Omnisend, but there are a lot more customizable options. We enjoy the greater amount of customization and hope to make the most of it as we continue with the platform."
"Horrible support. Just uninstalled today. The interface is clunky, and it has been a week and still no feed was setup. Customer support has stopped responding. 
Look elsewhere."
"Pro:
- variety of filter, segmentation, etc. for automatizations
- very complete related to marketing automatization + CRM (the CRM I havent checked yet)
- onboarding and other premium options to have 1 on 1 sessions and support Contra:
- it would be nice to set basic colors, fonts, currency, language, etc. for all the templates (language because in my case it would be nice to have the interface in english, but emails in spanish), as this is not available it cost extra time
- the onboarding could be a little more proactive from ActiveCampaign to give more suggestions, best practices etc. - the page is loading quite slow, I dont know if this is a problem right now (the last weeks) or since ever"
"Fantastic & super customer support by Zia, clean app interface & very easy to use. Highly Recommended...."
"I used this app as an email integration for clickfunnels, so I'm not sure exactly how the app operates in shopify, but the user interface for the actual Emaik Dashboard is very good and easy to use. I would say the one downside is that AC is a bit pricier"
"I’ve tried several different Shopify apps and this is hands down the most useful/comprehensive to date. It has a very user friendly interface, simple tutorials and includes just about every basic app needed to seamlessly run a successful store. They also have excellent support as a big plus. Highly recommended."
"At first, the app was not working well with our template so I reached out to customer service and they were EXTREMELY HELPFUL and solved the problem all the way through. They were very patient with us and our theme so the app would work seamlessly. The interface is easy to use and it's straight forward. Our customers have found this very useful and for us as well. I definitely recommend this app over other alerts app that I have tried!"
"best all-in-one app for conversions and user interface, makes the store look great. https://4urskn.com/"
Great App with great features! You won't regret the download. We personally like the interface and design of the app! Very minimalistic touch that translates into secureness for your customers!
Hi! This is Annibody from Hong Kong. Love the whole idea which aligns with our brand's values and Dane has been really helpful throughout the setup. The interface is beautiful and versatile. It is important to spread awareness in the the importance of reducing carbon footprints and be conscious about everyone's online shopping experience. Let's fight against climate change together!
"Very useful application. It offers you all the necessary options to improve the interface of your web page. It also has newly added SEO options. If you get this APP, you don't need to install any more, since it provides you with everything you need."
The interface is simple to use and understand! The develop team is super friendly and ready to assist you if you have any issues. I do recommend anyone who is just starting out their business to give this app a try :)
"Bold Product Options worked like a charm for what we needed on our site. We tried several different apps prior to Bold (simply because of the price), but going with Bold is worth it! Top notch customer service (Rick, Nick, Marty, and Val are rockstars!) and just the ease of the app interface surpasses the others. If you're contemplating if this is the right app for your commerce site, just give it a try and you'll be convinced."
"This is a fantastic app!  Why the default Shopify receipts/emails look so bad is beyond me.  OrderlyEmails fixes this issue with a great interface -- you will be up and running in minutes.  Plus, you can replace ALL of Shopify's terrible emails, not just a few as other apps offer.  OrderlyEmails look really great and were super easy to create and implement.  We tried a few of the competitors and there is no contest — OrderlyEmails beats them easily. Big plus that it is a one-time fee, not a montly fee as some of the others."
I honestly loved the interface it allowed me t access all the features I needed to successfully launch my campaign now I just need sales
"This app is everything you need for email marketing and customer service or engagement. Beginner friendly and beautiful interface for professional-looking email campaigns or automation, for free or budget-friendly price plans"
"The system works very well, with a simple to use interface... I required support a few times (to help me with my configuration, not because of issues) and the chat response we AMAZING EVERY TIME... Very quick and always helped me. I have 18 apps integrated into shopify, and the UpPromote support model is #1 (hands down!!). I served as an SVP for IBM with massive global support teams, so my expectations are high, yet exceeded on all fronts."
Great so far! Simple to set up and nice easy interface. Look forward to seeing if it works. Cheeeeeeers
Super fluent user experience indeed! Easy to use and the free plan is awesome! The paid plan price is reasonable.
"Very intuitive interface, really complete customization (in any language, this is very important!) No code required: excellent value for money."
"Does the job - but it's SUPER half-baked. You'll get what you want out of it, but you'll be pulling teeth to do so; and then once you set things up - it's interface is god awful and you'll be confused on what you set up in the first place!
But alas - It works well enough, and it's the only option. God damnit."
I tested out a number of solutions for providing a custom product building experience and this is the one we went with. The interface is easy to use and powerful enough for complex customization flows. The way options with pricing are displayed is the nicest I saw and on top of that they have support for custom styling.  I contacted support to discuss more complex integrations as part of our decision making process and they were absolutely amazing!
"In the bang for the buck department, Omnisend is awesome. Great features, easy to use interface. Their tutorials are actually *easy* to find which seems to be rare and if you can't figure it out, their support team is fast and efficient and talk like your co-workers on your team. Great!"
I'm new to Shopify and Omnisend. I'm impressed with their amazing and prompt customer service. Easy to use interface and overall service.
"I've been using Omnisend for a couple of months now and I honestly love it so far. Took a while to get used to the interface, but once I got the hang of it, it's a breeze. Also, another huge plus is their fantastic customer support. I can always get my questions answered in a very timely manner."
"Loved the sales pitch. Very nice + clean interface. However, UX is not very user friendly. It just takes so many more clicks to get what you want. Also, email block settings differ from one template to another so it's difficult to apply ""saved"" blocks. It looks like each template/automation was coded separately, so there's no uniformity. It also doesn't allow you to create multi-touchpoint emails, so you can't create follow up emails smoothly within one campaign. Everyone raves about CS, that's why I chose Omnisend over Klaviyo, but I have yet to get a good experience. Onboarding so far has not been pleasant. They promised that someone would help us set up our account, but I have done 95% of the work."
Just finished creating my first couple email automations and I LOVE this app so far! Super easy to use and figure out just by looking at the interface!
"I've used the app today, for the very first time and I love it.
It has a friendly user interface, all the functions you need to setup your e-mail campaigns in matter of minute.
Great job guys!!!"
So far so good! Very well built and a clean interface. Looking forward to moving all our affiliates over to this platform.
"Great Interface, Plenty of features. Got more than I bargained for with this one. Should have gotten started sooner.."
The WYSWYG editor interface is kind of simple to use but lack some interesting features. Customisation is also a bit restricted.
I liked the simple and intuitive interface. This app took around 5 mins to set up. Also my shop is minimalist. And the style is perfect. Nothing extra. Nothing extra. Thank
Super simple onboarding and set-up! Really excite to start testing this with new affiliates and love the interface and ease-of-use
"SO far so good!! just sent the first campaign, we'll see how it goes. Set up was a breeze, beautiful & easy-to-use interface, emails look nice and I have a high degree of confidence it was worth the time. Looking forward to seeing results."
Superb scalability. Efficient team. Very robust interface with automation. Makes managing affiliates a breeze!
Your interface and choice of colour make me dizzy. They are not user friendly at all. Everything seems complicated. Anyway I'm just another user. :)
"Quick guided setup, nice & easy interface. Will wait to see how its magic works. Registration form customization available, really nice."
"very easy, friendly interface, good suggestions and tips. I only did the first campaign, and this start was very interesting!"
"It's so easy to create a task whether for a form, automation or campaign. The user interface is very streamlined, easy to understand and follow. One minor suggestion, consider proof-reading some help files as I noticed some typos. Overall, this is a great app with lots of functionalities that will definitely help you grow your store. Highly recommended!"
"Just started to use, its interface is friendly. Simple and easy to operate, I think it should be pretty cool."
"I migrated to Omnisend after Mailchimp disconnected from Shopify. The free plan is streamlined, but it can do the essentials.  User experience is great. Designs are pleasing. Customer service is good. Import process was smooth! Syncs with Shopify seamlessly in real time.  I wish I could do some automations for free. But Shopify can do the basic ones. I honestly tried Shopify's new email features too. They are just a bit too basic for my needs right now.  This is my second successful business venture. We are in a heavy growth phase, and just received our first inventory shipment. I'm considering paying for Omnisend's annual ""standard"" plan to have more professional looking automation emails and do some AB testing."
"The user interface is awesome. Services Exceed Expectations, therefore I strongly recommend this app for both starters and professionals."
"I used this app to optimize images – speed up page load times and optimize filenames – thereby improving the user experience and ultimately, my SEO rankings. TinyIMG did everything possible to get the best result for all the SEO functionality I wanted to include. Stellar customer service. Thank you!"
"This has been awesome from day one. Very powerful but also a really nice, clean interface and great styling for emails etc. I'm a very happy customer!"
"SO MUCH NICER THAN KLAVIYO! And, just as powerful - if not more.  
I love Omnisend so much. In my brand, the ability to make things beautiful really matters.  And, Omnisend offers so much more when it comes to pop up design, campaign design, templates, and gamification of the user experience. Those little things really make a difference in conversions. 
Pair that with all the smart features like audience integration for ads and advanced segmentation - it's unbeatable in my eyes. SMS is like 5x cheaper than Klaviyo, too. 
The only thing missing is a more robust list of integration partners. They are working on getting recharge to have an abandon cart trigger, which will be a big help. And, I'd love to see them integrate with ThriveCart as I still use that for some landing pages.  They only have one quiz integration and that company is wonky, I hope they either build in simple quiz functionality or partner with more options. But, since they have a Zapier connection all these things can be worked around, for now.
So, so, happy I chose Omnisend."
I used this app on a small site. I just went and deleted the app I was currently using on this site to use here as well. I like how simple the interface is and does exactly what I need. Looking forward to finding out about the next TinyIMG's SEO app.
"Excellent app, I loved the interface, the very simple configuration as well as easy to use. Fully recommended."
"Love the Product Options App by Bold. After starting the trial they were quick to set up the App for us to use and it was super intuitive to use once I had to get in and customise what I was after. Along the way Bold support staff are always there to guide you, to help solve problems and they do this with the greatest customer service. The team is super professional. They operate like a tag team with your requests to keep them moving along so there's always someone working on it and communicating back and forth with their progress. In terms of the App, I love it. I was able to present options for our custom patina shoes that are super visual. Customers will have a much better user experience now thanks to the many options we were able to put at their disposal (all very visual too). 
The end result is sharp and clean looking, very professional. You can check out one of our Product pages that uses the Product Options App at the link below. You'll notice how visual the swatches are. The Bold team can make them magnify on hover over too. Very happy, out best App team to deal with so far and there are many good ones out there we've discovered along the way so this team is doing a sensational job. 
https://stauntonmoods.com/collections/mens-shoes/products/mens-oxford-carlos-santos-shoes-custom-patina-by-staunton-moods
The only improvement for a future edition I would like to see is the option to allow a customer to upload more than one file at a time. 
Great work Bold!"
Really easy to use interface and some great connectivity with Shopify ... Particularly like the unique code customer discounts.  Was using MailChimp - this is so much better
great app for e com stores. I wholeheartedly thank the developer for the simple interface and easy integration
Very easy interface and app has all the tools I would want and need to increase conversions and as a result generate more revenue.
Great :) Easy to use! Easy interface and great integration with Shopify! Customer service very helpful!
Really good app. Basic interface and instant action. If you need this king image optimizer TınyIMG will be best choice.
"UPDATED: After leaving my review, I read a few written by less than satisfied customers. Some people are leaving 1-star ratings because they said the prices were not displaying correctly, etc. I don't know the exact cause of their particular errors, but I can tell you this is not a cause to give up. You have to realize that you are adding a third-party code to an already existing and functioning system. Depending on your theme, or the changes you've made to it, or the third-party apps you previously used, things may not always look quite right. And there may be clashes with code from other apps (in my case, I had a clash with an app that I had previously removed!). The point is, Bold support technicians are there to resolve all these issues and make tweaks in your code. Whether it was to change the order in which the options were displayed, or correct the errors with the displaying of the prices, they were always there and helped me get my shop exactly to where I want it to be.
ORIGINAL REVIEW
The customer support I received with Bold has been outstanding. I am not familiar with coding at all and was relying on the easy user interface to create product optimization options for my shop with Product Options by Bold. II had a lot of questions along the way -- each one was answered in a very prompt manner by the support staff. You can email them or request a phone call. I have done both, and both channels of communication worked great. This initial communication helped me get up and running.
Further along, I noticed a few glitches in the way my prices were displaying. This was no fault of Bold -- rather a conflict in code segments between their app and an app I previously used (and uninstalled). The problem was not a typical one and had many scratching their heads. Bold support staff researched the problem for days and tweaked the code until they got it completely fixed and resolved. Many thanks to Cody and Lawrence and their teams.
I feel completely safe knowing I won't be left hanging by the app developer. I have purchased another Bold app since, and highly recommend this company."
"Great app, highly recommended if you're looking to boost conversion rates! Simple interface & clean instructions."
Does exactly what it promises - optimizing image sizes for your site. An important part of SEO and user experience.
I used this app to optimize my page speed by reducing image sizes. Does its job and easy to use interface.
"Great customer service, fast response. They're always willing to help. User interface is also pretty easy to use."
"These guys go the extra mile with regard to support. Above and beyond! Excellent!
ORIGINAL REVIEW
I inherited the old website when I joined the company and my greatest goal was to rebuild it as it was soooo dated. We are a sports clothing company and have always offered a personalisation service so that our customers can add a name, a number, initials or a club badge or logo. It's very popular and that functionality needed to remain on the site.
The legacy site had this functionality custom built on top of the Shopify platform and wasn't going to work if I changed the theme and structure of the site. Neither did I have the help of the programmer/s that had bespoke coded the options previously. So, I set out to find the best solution for the new site and found Bold Product Options which was by far the best app for the job. We have quite a few variations of personalisation and some fairly complicated sets of options.
I also wanted it to be a good user experience and using Bold Product Options and the  conditional rules that come with the Premium version, I was able to not only streamline the way the personalisation worked and make it a good user experience for but it looked good on screen too.
I have had a very good experience with regard to support. I haven't needed too much help as I found Product Options very easy to setup and use 'out of the box'. Having said that any problems I have had have been promptly dealt with and the support staff are very friendly and quick to respond.
I had one problem which was actually specific to the 3rd party theme I am using but the Bold guys were straight on it, immediately made a minor edit and solved the problem.
I have used support on 5 or 6 occasions and can't fault it whatsoever. All Good!

"Just tried it.  
Desktop: Page load is like on Amazon.com = 1sec in general. I give 4**** as just starting. But App Interface is fantastic! :)
Mobile: is slow --- like 2-3 secs load page + blurry images"
"iv try to use this one, the instruction of this app is very understandable for those who is not native English speak. but the plan pricing is very Expensive. and basica integrate necessary one ex: PayPal. is you need to upgrade plan. I probably use free plan for awhile and see if it is worth it to upgrade. but the interface is very good and easy"
very user friendly! I appreciate the care given to creating a good user experience and making it easy to quality check the sign-up process.
"Over 95% of our business is made-to-order, with the customer driving one-of-kind designs based on their military service and accomplishments. Not only can they configure our pottery to display the unit(s) where they served, but they can order extensive personalization with our hand engraving services. We need to catch up to 7 lines of text, charge for each line, and allow for adding multiple logos on a beer or coffee mug.
Bold's Product Options allows us to be create groups of options and logics which correspond to different types of military service in different military units. We only have to display those logos or insignia that are relevant to our customer. Additionally, the customer feels like they can design and build a precise celebration of their service. This has been a massive win for both Potter's Fire and our customers.
With Bold's Product Options App we have been able to raise our average sale by more than 30%. Our conversion rate has increased by more than 80%, and customer satisfaction with the purchase process has soared. This App may not have the graphical WYSIWYG interface, but it performs, sells, and simplifies an otherwise complex buying process. In addition it has reduced the number of variants we use to create by more than 85%. More product comes to market more quickly and converts to revenue at a higher rate, what's wrong with that?
Beyond the functionality, the APP is supported by a fine group of extremely responsive professionals. When I have a request, they respond quickly, efficiently, and send me email updates along the way. Their website sports a service request tracking system that helps you to keep track of issues, conversations with the technical staff, and the ultimate resolution. Plus, you can chat realtime with a technical support rep there too.
This one's a keeper for us, Potter's Fire will continue to use, deploy, and stretch the capabilities of Product Options for some time to come...
Cheers!"
I've been using the app for a few months now for 2 stores and it's really good. The email builder is pretty straight forward and integrations are simple to use. The client service is 10/10. Super fast responses and are always trying to find solution. The only reason I'm not giving a 5 star review is the user interface. It takes time to get used to it and even though it only has a handful of menus it's not super intuitive and clunky. But you get used to it fast so I guess it's Ok. It works exactly like advertised and it's way cheaper than other similar services. You won't get a better deal than this.
"Love this app. Very nice. A bit confusing interface sometimes. Things could be a bit more convenient, but all in all - very useful once you I got used to it and very reliable"
"Easy to set up. Easy for affiliates to get started. Clear interface and awesome features. It is also greatly customizable, therefore you can adjust all emails and layouts according to your brand. Satisfied client!"
Very helpful customer support! The app is great for add on products or different variations of a product. The user interface is really easy to work as well.
"Great interface, easy to use and navigate. Really helpful and timely customer service support made all the difference! :)"
"We switched after have problems with other apps. The interface has been great but it would be helpful to have more detailed information for setting up. However, when I connected for help Sherwin was great at pinpointing the issue and making sure the fix was successful."
Extremely Helpful & Friendly Team. All the steps have been briefly instructed before launching the app on google. Overall a best user experience  till now. I wud recommend Vajro to all who are willing to bring their storefront online. All the best.
"I have been using this app for longer than I can remember. The interface and support staff is just fantastic as well. I just got off chat with Melody and she helped me through some issues I was having with customer reviews, fast and solved the issue right away."
"I had high hopes for this.  I used this for about 6 months and pulled the plug.  The interface is very, very unfriendly, like staring at an M. C. Escher lithograph.  We tried it in hopes of saving a few percent on the shipping, but the lost productivity of battling the interface whenever you want to do anything ultimately made it a net loss for us.    If you ship a lot it might be worth it to learn the interface... but at about 50 or so packages a week – what we ship – the super simple, clean and easy Endicia app is a much better choice in my experience."
Great app and great service. They respond very quickly and will help you out with any questions you have. The interface is super easy to use also.
"The Team at Vajro has been hands-on at understanding our requirements and providing timely solutions to make the user experience on our app seamless and user friendly. The team responded to all our queries and provided technical help in resolving glitches and ensured the same was done in quick time. I congratulate the team on providing excellent service to the vendor. Keep up the great work 
-Team Juicy Chemistry"
"Great app, works really well and they also offer a free version for you to try out. Interface is very easy to use and set up"
"The best app for shipping I've used, and the only one I've ever needed. Excellent customer support, low cost and integrates every online store we have (AMAZON, EBAY, ETSY except HOUZZ). 
Super simple interface makes shipping very efficient - a must for any serious ecommerce store."
"We've been using ShippingEasy for over 3 years now and have to say, it's been seamlessly efficient and easy to use. The interface is straightforward and allows us to ship our items quickly and in a more organized manner. On top of that, their customer service team is always readily and happily available to answer any question. Definitely recommend this app for your shipping needs!"
"Excellent app, has many features and the interface is intuitive, so it's easy to work with. Great support too."
Great free app to boost sales! Simple but effective interface with great free options that lead to a successful store!
"easy to use so far!, i just dowloaded it and it's been easy to use so far, its user freindly and has good looking interface"
"Ironically named ShippingEasy when it is nothing but difficult. The interface isn't bad, but when bugs do come up, don't expect any help. Their sales staff is easy to reach, bugging you by chat everytime you go to their site, but try to get support, good luck!!! The forums are useless taking days to get a response, and email is even worse with message going completely unanswered. Don't expect this to change anytime soon, the company was bought by Stamps.com, notorious for their terrible customer service."
"Use esta aplicación para descuentos por volúmen y la interface es muy sencilla y es facil de usar. Y cuando surge algún problema con la aplicación, te atienden rápido y son muy amables."
"Easily my favourite app! Gap-filling, as I always thought its not logical to show the shipping costs at the last step!!! Biggest failures of every e-commerce system. I abandoned myself carts often because of this. In my opinion every e-commerce system should offer this, but they dont :) So here we have an app that does exactly what I need. It shows the shipping costs already on the mini cart (drawer cart), so there are no surprises for the customer. I think this encourages purchases and customer satisfaction. Besides this essential function, the app has a good interface, easy to learn and use. I also had some unique queries on how and where to display specific parts, and they helped very fast and professionally every time!!! All these for an affordable price! I really dont know how to praise them...go, just check our store how it works! :)"
"Pretty good at its simple function, but hard to design a beautiful popup window + reporting and dashboard interfaces are AWFUL. It's fairly easy for the service to pay for itself (if you're on the $9.99/mo plan), but is there a way to easily see total revenue generated because of the app (not just MTD)? No. I don't really care how many times something was added to the cart, I care about how many times it was *purchased.*"
"Does exactly what is says on the tin and then some more! Very useful app, Plenty of features. too easy to use! Crispy, clean interface. Made my social media end of things a breeze and has already in one week given me approx 200 likes on Facebook. Cheers guys, keep up the great work."
"Shopney helped us to increase our sales , and all our customers liked its interface very much , special thanks to Melissa in the support team"
"We have Promo bar, Contact US form and Face Book chat. Promo Bar and Contact US form are working very well. We have not use Face Book chat much but it will also be good. All these apps which we have are free. Nothing can be better then free. Its hard to believe that Zotabox is offering all these apps free of charge. The interface and integration of there apps to our store was straight forward. We highly recommend this company and there product. Keep it up all the good work."
"Shopney is the absolute best when it comes to customer service and getting your app up fast! Super easy interface and very easy process. Melissa & Team have been SOOO helpful throughout the whole onboarding process, I can't believe it. If I could give 10/5 stars I would. Thanks Shopney!"
Does it exactly what it says on the tin and the user interface is CLEAN. If you're looking for a Hello Bar type app then this is the one.
It is better than most applications in terms of interface and ease of use. Best Mobile App editor in the Shopify marketplace.
"Amazing app with all the easy interface, nice music and videofying blend! :)
.............recommended."
We have been working with Shopney since the past few weeks to get our app finalized and launched. Melissa and the team have been excellent in responding and accommodating our changes to make sure the app look matches our brand and color theme. Great support so far. The backend interface is pretty easy to use - would prefer to have some more customization though. Overall the look and feel of the native app seems great. Waiting for the final app launch now on the stores.
"Very nice and elegant interface, design and themes are excellent.
Customer service is excellent, Melissa was wonderful and very patient.
My very best wishes to Shopney's team!"
For a free its amazing. It is perfect and does exactly what it needs to do and the interface is simple to use when setting it up. I recently changed the theme and it caused my templates to not work properly and the support team when above and beyond to fix the issue and get it working within just a few hours of contacting them. Great customer support.
"We were very impressed by the well designed and easy to use user interface of the administration area. I also found the documentation very helpful, even for complex things like integrations. The support is extremely responsive and helped with those little issues, when we got stuck connecting analytics, for example. 
We really liked the ""Preview"" feature, where it is possible to see and try out the app on the phone, without the need to publish it first. 
The support team is extraordinarily helpful when it comes to publishing the app. We are going to publish ours, soon, and they give us the confidence to do it the right way. Great for a small business. Thank you."
"Best Mobile App Builder in Shopify App Store. 
Shopney have the Best App Designing Dashboard which are Clean and Easy to Use. It's Sync's everything from my shopify store automatically so it's faster building the app.
Our App is Faster, Beautiful Design and Best User Experience. 
We Recommend Shopney for App Development."
"I use this app to help me do me campaign. I really like the way the app interact with me, it is a nice and friendly interface. I would like more functionaties in the from plan to start making pop ups"
Simple to setup and to integrate.  Provides a great user interface and allows us to capture customer emails easily without hassle.  I hope to upgrade once we see value in the app.  It is starting to look good so far.
Loved every moment working with this team! You guys are are the best! The interface is extremely user friendly and the Team is always on call. Keep up the good work
"MageNative has quick turn around and great rates.  Getting my app processed and programed, most importantly APPROVED by apple fast was impressive.  Had a horrible experience with Tap Cart, these guys saved the day! Got runaround for months before finding this company.  Highly recommend over the competition.  Not as many options to colorfully customize your app but gets the job done in a minimal fashion! Sleek, clean, simple design.  I really appreciate the attention, effort and hard work these guys put in right away and got everything done in a few days after getting screwed by Tap Cart.  Grateful so far for the experience.  I would recommend if you are not satisfied with Tap Cart or don't like Polobal's interface.  This is best of both worlds. offers android and apple.  Good service, hard working team."
"Really impressed with the app, keep up the good work!!! Interface is very intuitive and easy to use."
Great app! Super easy to use and a great way of engaging with customers to improve their user experience. Highly recommend!
Very nice user interface. I had an issue with activating my initial pop-up but worked out well in the end.
Great for new online stores. Easy to use and top notch user experience. Not disappointed with this new addition to my store.
"Very easy to set up and use, nice clean interface. Sometimes you just want a simple app and this does the trick. Good customer service if you have any questions. Can't fault it."
"Very easy to use and practical FAQ tool, the interface is very simple and intuitive to use, highly recommended!"
"There is a reason, this app did not get any Rating lower than 5. It does what it promises. Clean interface, Almost Every Customization Options & a Responsive Faq Page and Best of All, The Developer really Listens."
This FAQs app is simple to use and straightforward to implement. It works great and has the right amount of customization possible. Very clean interface and customer experience. It was the third app we tried and it's a keeper!
"I just installed this app, but the interface is extremely easy to use, and it automatically located previously abandoned carts I had before the app was even installed. Great product."
"Probably the easiest to use cart recovery app I have tried yet. Stats are all right there, and the user interface is really intuitive!"
Very easy to integrate and easy to use. Up and running within minutes and very good interface. Recommended...
"This app has alot of potential given it's price point. The support has been very responsive through the email: support@thimatic.com and providing custom coding with specific bundles on specific products. I do wish there was more functionality within their native app interface to achieve this on my own instead of always having to email the support team. Nonetheless, I give them 5 stars for the great support provided thus far. I am hoping that the team can build the ability to choose variants/colorways within a single listing that is being bundled in multiples for 2 packs or tri packs of a product with discount functionality. Thank you so much for your efforts Thimatic team! From sporthijab.co"
"A bit disappointed. I previously used the ""Tawk.To"" app, but I thought I would make the switch to Tidio because I enjoyed the design a lot better. But here's the problem, there is a big communication delay between Mobile and Desktop. I have to quit out of Tidio and restart the entire desktop application for the interface to mirror my mobile app properly.. Sometimes the problem is never solved when I restart both applications. Right now, the Tidio mobile app is telling me there are 7 people on my website - but the Tidio desktop app is telling me there are 9 people.. Guys, this is a pretty big deal. And because of this error, none of the analytics on the Tidio App should be trusted. I have to ask myself, am I missing chats? Who knows, because it's not reporting correctly. I have missed every single chat I have gotten so far since downloading the application. I never missed a single chat when using the ""Tawk.To"" application. Tidio never reports correctly since the day I downloaded it. And if you're wondering, Yes- both my mobile and desktop apps are synced under the same username. My previous chat application ""Tawk.To"" never had these problems, ever. 
Unfortunately, I hate to say it but I need an immediate refund. Not only is the app not syncing, but the analytics cannot be trusted due to software issues.

Thanks"
"Very helpful app, just hope the interface can be more lean. Some part is confusing, and I am kind of force to diret here to leave a reveal. Hope it works."
This APP is the bomb! It's User friendly and its FUN. The interface is simple yet very effective. It will help your store so many emails! Definitely a recommended app! NO BRAINER to use it. Happy!
Quite easy app. Very friendly interface. Nice tutorials. Very happy about this app!
"AMAZING. What more can I say. This is simply the industry standard if it comes to chat bots. Their support is amazing as well. The best you’ll find. Really, don’t waste your time and just get this app for your online shop. They don’t pay me to write this :) Very simple and professional user interface. Live support super fast and friendly. Martin, Kamil they are awesome! Will definitely upgrade and recommend to others. The free version gives you enough room to grow as a start up business. Thanks so much!"
"Easy to install, with no problems. I tested it out and it worked great! It was very easy to understand the interface, and easy to create bots for answering basic questions. Exactly what I needed, an all-around great app."
Recommended. Awesome free feature. Lots of customization option. Customization interface could be better.
"It works really well and is very easy to install, finished the setup in less than 10 minutes. The interface is cluttered and a bit slow to load but overall its great, we have only used it for direct whatsapp chat"
"Love the app, would have been perfect with a better user interface. I was so tempted to uninstall initially, but I am glad that I did not."
"Very easy to use, clean user interface and extremely tempting. Great way to capture emails for my shopify stores."
A quite easy app. Very friendly interface. Nice tutorials. I'm quite happy about this app. I can add that customer service is also very friendly and quick!
"it is easy to operate this application but set up take some time. If it can make the interface more user friendly, that will help new users."
so far amazing this app gives you what you need with a beautiful and smart interface thanks allot for your effort
I was introduced by someone to use EPRLO and so far I like the user interface and the products range.
Eprolo has fastest shipping rates and eprolo have easy to use interface that drop shippers could easily use.
"The interface is intuitive. The products are easy to find and to send to the store.
Customer service is very serious (response within 24 hours due to the + 7 hour time difference).
Orders are processed within 3 days.
I recommend Eprolo."
Ez To Use. Good User Experience.
ça fait 3 mois que je utiliser ce application.j'aime bien l'interface facile à utiliser parfaite pour une débutante
This was a great additional to my store. It looks classy and clean. The dash board provided great information. The interface and usability for my customers to create multiple wishlist and add and remove items is smooth. And the customer service is top notch. Thank you Neejah for following up even when I got too busy to get back to you.
"Amazing user interface, great customer service, many great template designs to be explored. Do give it a try with LayoutHub!"
Super clean interface! Looks great on our site. Very happy with the customer service too. Highly recommend this app. www.bugaloobaby.com
"Ultimately my initial problems with the app installation boiled down to my mishandling of the Shopify user interface! In other words, USER ERROR! The support team talked me through my fundamental misunderstanding, and patiently guided me towards the solution.
Now they have 5 stars from me because the app seems to work perfectly!"
Nice FAQ app... can't beat the price... clean interface and decent features for a simple FAQ... Thank you!!
"I am so impressed with this app. Its easy to use, Fresh, Clean, Crispy interface with very east to follow instructions that really work and put your site on the SEO Straight and Narrow. They are even  offering 5 day webinar for FREE to help you care for your website and SEO issues. We got EuropaBay from 35% to 86% after 2/3 tests (15 mins work!) Fantastic app and a must have if your serious about your website/business. Our site is now loading in 2.02 seconds thanks to SEO Doctor"
"works perfect! I love it nic einterface, details, easy to use. Remember if you cant add the adress they tell you to the menu its because you must add the whole adress including your domain."
"I recommend this app. It is a very good user experience. The customer service patiently solved the problem for me, and finally achieved the expected effect in my heart."
"excellent app that works flawlessly. Has a fine interface and easy to navigate
excellent app that works flawlessly. Has a fine interface and easy to navigate"
"UPDATE: app has been fixed. Excellent resolution and response time. Hope this won't happen again. I really like the interface and I do not want to have to move everything.
I thought it was a great app until it started crashing today. Haven't been able to move or edit any of the FAQ articles in a while and getting more frustrated by the minute. Hope this is just a temporary problem. Otherwise it's pretty easy and simple to use and get around.
https://www.drawnbyjessica.com/apps/help-center"
"This is a good app.  I found it has a clean interface and is straightforward to use.  I had one little temporary issue:  Our website has a dark background and the defaults on the app presented questions on FAQ that were hard to read when not selected.  But a note to their support resulted in a message back the next morning with a short snippet of code to insert in the theme.css.liquid code which immediately fixed the issue.  Thanks Marius for quick response!
I also note that use of this app does not slow the mobile website load speed (assessed using testmysite.thinkwithgoogle.com), which cannot be said for all apps.  I would certainly recommend using this app."
I like the interface and comfort of this app. FAQ's looks very professional and easy-readable. Thank you so much!
"This app litteraly gets you to build the website as you imaginate it, and without coding knowledge! I have to sincerely say that this app surprised me a lot. The easy interface and how fast you can do things, and also the incredible support they offer."
"Intuitive interface, great customer service, looks great on our website! ALL FOR FREE! Highly recommended :)"
"I'm currently using this app so that I can have an all in one app that is a lot less hassle. I saw that this one was the whole package. 
So far, it looks like it will really help. I have struggled with finding a way to reach out to customers without damaging the user experience. So I feel that this will provide a way that isn't TOO ""in your face about it."" 
It looks like it will help, and navigation is great. They provide excellent default messages and the whole thing is very easy to understand. I am very excited to see how it helps my store be better!"
"Excellent app, super-responsive support and very good-looking simple interface. Exactly what's needed for an FAQ page. Would love to see this app expand into FAQs for product pages and collection pages. We're fans of Eoscity from now on! Thanks a lot for providing such superb solution, and for free. Highly recommended +++++"
"Great app, clean interface. Works too well, couldn't steal my own pictures. Haha! I do wish it had more features, but for 2 bucks a month it's a bargain."
I just started using this app and so far its great. I was using 3 different apps for what this one apps provides. Easy to use and good interface. Would recommend to others.
"Powerful features and simple to use interface, and it's free, thank you.................................."
Just installed this app with no problems. I'm using it to prevent people from stealing my products and descriptions without working for it. The interface of the app is quite simple to use.
I easy to use and very good interface
"The app itself is handy, and it's a must for any merchant that needs to know his data. You can pretty much get anything you want with a friendly user interface. The best thing is their customer support, they are amazing and beneficial. They did create a custom report for me and address all my issues. No wonder they over 500 reviews with 5 stars."
Great interface! Love how easy it is to use and navigate.
"Didn't work for me. Interface is awkward to navigate and the ""contact"" button just simply didn't work. URL is set to ""www.yourdomain.com/apps-help-centre"". Couldn't find a way to edit this, looks odd and unprofessional to have ""apps"" in your URL rather than ""pages"". The app needs access to your customers and customers data for no reason. There's no reason that the app needs it and I'm disappointed in Oberlo for using this tactic to steal our customer data. If you respect your customers and your own integrity, do not install this."
"great support, super easy interface. Works like charm. Love all the features. I was able to create a report in minutes."
Great app! Clean and professional interface both on the front end and back end of the app which is not always the case with free apps. Thanks Oberlo team!
Great app interface but even better customer service. Dilys and Maria have been amazing help. Would recommend.
Great support every time I've had an issue. Easy to use and interface is simple. Would recommend it to anyone looking to build a page.
So far so good! Just got it all setup and love the interface and layout! Hopefully it drives engagement and sales.
"After-sales service is very good. After buying the basic plan, you can edit the code yourself, which is very convenient. There are many templates to choose from, and the interface is very user-friendly. You can save different sections for later use. Even people who don't know how to program can use it easily. It would be better if the ""dragging"" feature can be achieved, but it seems a bit difficult. In short, after using it, you can achieve a relatively beautiful interface in a short period of time. Of course, there are many functions that can be improved, such as adding a return button to the user editing interface. For example, a video on a web page can be played on the same page without jumping."
"The app's interface is very userfriendly. I like it. The support provided was also very good and fast. Thank you, Maria!"
Swell makes it easy for the customers be well Swell.  Easy to use interface. will certainly recommend!!!!
"So far so good. Looking forward to seeing our customers redeeming their rewards. Easy interface/customization. Well done, thanks!"
"So far so good. We haven't used it much, but the interface is simple and looks like it will work for what we need."
We are really excited to see how well Swell helps our business! The interface is very well thought out and easy to setup.
App is beautifully crafted for a clean and slick interface. Customers are able to search the F.A.Q. by using the search bar provided. Two thumbs up! Thank you!
Very convenient. Support is fast and great. Has everything we need in export options and to look at our data across multiple stores in one interface.
"I'm rarely compelled to write reviews but I just had to say how brilliant this app is! The drag-and-drop interface is super easy and intuitive and the result was perfect and great-looking. I'm a graphic designer and am picky about how things look but this app needed no tweaking at all. It even ""magically"" used my theme so the colours and fonts matched without me having to do anything. I was delighted to learn I could use jump-to links so I'll be able to easily direct customers to specific Q&As.
My only (minor) recommendations would be:
- Being able to use links to the parent category (e.g. shipping) as well as a specific question. 
- I'm in Australia so would prefer to have the option to change the heading to Help Centre (not the US 'Center'). 
- The bullet points aren't working. 
Thank you for such a great app!"
So this app is incredible. Beautiful designs that are easier to implement than those on Squarespace (although Squarespace is fantastic as well). The customer service staff and live chat interface will knock your socks off.
Interface is a bit messy buy the demo video helps a lot. The app is really useful if your website template has a small checkout icon and you'd like to make it clearer for customers. Also helps streamline checkout process. Technical support was very helpful and fixed an issue within a blink of an eye
"We had been using their Data Export app for a while, after checking out Report Pundit, we decided to switch over. They were able to connect our multiple Shopify accounts so that I can now pull reports across all of our stores. This feature alone is huge for us. This process use to take a full day, and can now be pulled in a matter of minutes. I can manipulate the data in real time and the user interface is clean and simple to understand. The support behind this product (and the other eStore Automate apps) is top notch. Reuben, Gabriel, and everyone else that I have had the pleasure of interacting with have been polite, informative, and quick to address any questions and concerns."
It is a very easy interface to work with and no glitches at all
Absolutely love the interface and the pre-set workflows. Rainy has been fantastic with helping out and getting us going. Looking forward to getting this fully flying!
"We've only had it for a short time but I really like the support. The interface is clear and easy to work with. I'll update in a few weeks about how many sales we actually get.
Edit: After a couple weeks I can say that this app works very well. We are getting a lot of people coming to the store after learning that the product they wanted is available. In the dashboard, the orders total still shows 0 so I wondered if it is working but many of the email addresses of buyers match the notified customers so I think they didn't respond right away but later came back and bought. Great and effective way to know what people want and alert customers to restocking."
"I haven't used the app yet, but I am hoping it will help increase conversion on my site. The interface seems intuitive enough."
"FIRST REVIEW: Okayyyyy blown away by this app! Personalized support in the middle of the night, custom coding things for me. this app is awesome and with the best customer support! It's going to bring a lot of extra revenue in from lost out of stock sales too. Really excited about it! Way prettier and better easier to use interface than the competitors (I download several similar apps and this one seems way better than the others) UPDATED REVIEW:
after initial setup, customer service has actually been horrible. the emails are not sending to customers and they keep saying that the development team will look into it, but never getting back to me. I check in every single week about it and never get a response. Week after week they tell me ""the development team hasn't gotten back to us yet, I'll let you know when they do"" And yet I'm still being charged every month for a service that is not working. Not a single email is being sent out. I was really hopeful about this but losing hope that it's something that can even work."
Easy to use and great interface of data! This app has helped with our restocking efforts and understanding the customer behavior/purchasing power.
"Excellent app and even better support. We switched over from another app because of this one's premium app integration, and have found it works even better than our previous app. The interface is simple and easy to understand, the buttons very customizable, and has lots of useful features. The support team is quick and friendly, and their development team resolved an initial integration problem for us quickly. A big plus that their support team works USA hours. We look forward to using this app for a long time!"
"The app is the functional exactly the same way, as described.
Interface SIMPLIFIED!
Support EXCELLENT!"
"So far, so good! I like the easy to use interface and presets!"
"We tried a few different versions of a store locator app until we fully converted to Bold. Needless to say, we're sold. We've used a few different apps from them and have always received solid service. This was no different. Their team actually entered all of our data and did the full install for us in less than 24 hours. 
The interface is clean, and our customers have quit emailing us with questions about locations because all the information is clearly held within the locator."
"I love JustUno! The interface is so easy to use and it's really helped me capture more customer emails with an onboarding campaign.
Mica from Evan & Jane (https://evanandjane.com)"
I used this app and it helped very much it's easy to use and very friendly interface I like it very much
We've received so much consistent business through the JustUno promotions. Versatile interface allows us to make timely and appropriate banners through the year. And the customer service is top notch.
Easy to set up and great interface!
Customer support team is awesome. This app's interface is programmed really well. It helps me convert customers when out of stock items come back
"Great and easy-to-use app with friendly user interface. Customer service is fast, and resolutions are quick!"
"Very smart app, very strong support team, I work with many intermediate app but this one is the top, it will save your time and money, The Syn is very fast and bulk order will help you make a bulk order one time, the interface is veeeery easy and light, I think they need to improve the mobile version to be the top of the top , Highly recommended"
"I love this app!  It has an interface that is very easy to use and understand.  I used this program to connect our on-line cheesecake shop to our in-store Quickbooks POS system.  It creates a sales order in POS and then we can prepare the cakes, create labels and ship.  We then can post all this info back to the web store so the inventory matches.
I would highly recommend this to anyone using Quickbooks!"
"Rip off, Their prices are ridiculously high. I do not recommend them. Also their interface is terrible. YOTOP is scam"
"First of all, I want to say that customer service is not great! I'm new in this business and she spoke to me harshly. Also, some sub-domain problems with shopify and i didn't like the experience. The interface is hard to manage."
"I've been using this application for several months, and it's by far the best page builder that exists on shopify. Why: - No limit imposed in terms of creativity
- the speed of the page
- the huge panel of application partners with pagefly
-the very efficient customer service
-The responsive quality Ps: I noticed some improvements that would be greatly appreciated in a future version Improvement of the slider section:
- make manual scrolling more fluid
- add an overflow option with the future slides appearing on the sides. - create a loop of slides in one direction (without the last slide going back to the first)
- have an option to change the size and color of the arrows. Improvement of the product media section.
- have more parameters to change the size and space of the media list items
- make manual scrolling more fluid I am very committed to using your application, and I would love to help you improve your application with my user experience"
"Very very very disappointed with this app, and I will be looking for alternatives.
I was forced to migrate across to DSers from Oberlo, but it falls far short. I have to pay $19.90 a month to access features that were on the free plan in Oberlo. The interface is buggy and not user friendly. I've had endless issues and do NOT recommend.
Also, I contacted them for support on day 1 and after helping me they were SUPER pushy for me to leave a review, before I'd had a chance to use the app. Now I feel ready to leave a review after trying to use it for 2 weeks.
Terrible."
"I really wish I could rank it higher. It has been a blessing to be able to create landing pages for my products. It helped my ROI immensely. Unfortunately, in these days of SEO, their page speed is much lacking. When you go to their site to find out how to speed it up, the article is very defensive, blaming the site speed on everything else. I set up a simple contact form using their base template and the Google Lighthouse speed rating was a 23. I will continue to use it until I can test other Shopify page builders and their speed. User experience is first and foremost today. Pagefly has an easy platform, so they are great at that. I'm trying to give my customers user experience and Pagefly isn't the best at that speed-wise."
"Très bonne alternative à Oberlo. Globalement la même interface à quelques détails près. Et merci à Villanelle pour son aide sur Messenger, super réactivité !"
I used the app it is very useful to see how people interact with your site and helps improve on the user interface side and design as well as the web flow. Can you make it possible to edit the color of the drop down menu option.
"The reason this gets only 2 stars are 2 main issues : 1. Way overpriced (when you think shopify costs $30 per month for a vry extensive system and platform) - this at the same cost after any useful addons are selected also at very close to $30 is a bit of a rip off - this is $350 per year... which once setup doesnt mean any work from them or any ongoing heavy use like complex software. The price should be around $10 per month (or $100 per year) with all options - that would be actually reasonable. 2. It translates all the urls into foreign language special characters - which is firstly useless and not relevant for google or seo (google sees non special characters exactly as the same and word are the same) and secondly a nightmare to copy and paste into other systems, share to others (looks ridiculous) and use as hyper links in extrenal links etc. Upon questioning them and suggesting this be changed by defauly - the response was clearly they are not bothered and i would have to manually edit 1500 pages of the site if i wanted to... The app overall works ok - but these 2 factors above make it both a rip off and frustrating to use. Oh and they have this strange system of pasting some extra code after a url of your site so you can edit that site - but dont make that obviously anywhere in the app or the app settings!! you have to go unting for this in some help page... crazy. The whole app has potential but needs much better people running it and using logic on its interface...."
"Brilliant app with great functions and an easy to use interface. But most importantly, a wonderfully friendly, supportive, prompt and very helpful customer service!"
"This is a good dealer locator app. Easy to use back end interface. We had some issues early on with the page not populating quickly, but support was responsive in getting everything up and running."
Awesome app...simple interface.  USE IT!
This interface is very user friendly. im just starting to use it so I haven't discovered all of it's functions.
This app is just great! I love that the plans allow you to gain some momentum before taking the plunge.The interface is good and the workflows are intuitive. I highly recommend!
"This app has been very useful, easy to integrate and easy to  update. Our retailer base is spread our across the globe as well, so we are entering very different kinds of data. Store Locator has handled it all. I also really appreciate the interface and how good it looks in our store. If you are looking for a good way to point customers to a brick and mortar location, Store Locator is a very solid choice"
"Brilliant pop up, free to use on Shopify (up to 5000 leads) which is perfect for a start up, intergrates with mail  chimp and new dashboard/user interface makes creating pop up campaigns a doddle. This is a must have app for any Shopify store and beats the competition hands down!"
Thanks Shappify for providing a great dealer locator! The interface is easy to use and it gives us an insight into where are customers are looking to find our products. Well done!
"This app was easy to install, and seems to work well.  I am nervous about the increased expense as we are growing rapidly from about 500 current shops that carry our line.  The functionality, data upload, and user interface all seem great though."
"So far, so good.  Pretty simple interface from a bad ass developer!"
"The customer service is really responsible, solving the problems very quickly. The user experience of the app is also great, easy to operate."
"Does exactly what it says! Interface is easy to use too, just a few clicks are you are done!"
Great APP Very new to Shopfiy and this APP Was easy to set up within a few minutes. super cool. easy user interface and clear guide on how to use it.
"Great functionality. Little tricky to make work perfectly, but the MLVeda team are very helpful. Works with Shopify multicurrency which makes this an amazing feature for international customer user experience."
"I REALLY GAVE THIS MY BEST SHOT.
THEY TRY AND MAKE YOUR GIVE THEM A 5 STAR REVIEW OF THE APP AFTER THE DEMO CHAT WHICH YASH CONDUCTS, DONT GET SUCKED IN.  
THE IDEA IS GOOD
BUT THE APP IS NOT GOOD, TOO CLUNKY.
READ THE REAL REVIEWS
SUPPORT TAKES TOO LONG TO RESPOND
CHAT SUPPORT TAKES 30 MINUTES TO GET BACK TO EACH RESPONSE
MULTI CURRENCY LOADS IN THREE UNITS WHEN LOADING PAGE
TAKES 3-4 SECONDS AND WHEN CHANGING PRODUCT VARIATION ON PAGE IT TAKES ANOTHER 5 SECONDS
IT'S NOT INTEGRATED WITH PAYPAL SO EVEN IF YOU HAVE ANOTHER CURRENCY PAYPAL WILL SEND YOUR CUSTOMER WITH THE DEFAULT CURRENCY.
CURRENTLY ON MY PRODUCT LISTING PAGE SHOWS CORRECT PRICE BUT WHEN YOU LOAD THE DESCRIPTION PAGE ITS WRONG.
I TRIED FOR 2 DAYS NOW TO WORK WITH THESE GUYS BUT ITS NOT WORKING
SITES SPEED SLOWS DRAMATICALLY.
END USER EXPERIENCE ISNT GOOD
I WANT THEM TO REMOVE THE APP AND REFUND ME.
BETTER OFF BUILDING SITE IN ANOTHER CURRENCY AND GETTING ANOTHER SHOPIFY ACCOUNT AT  A DISCOUNTED RATE
THIS IS A SUPER DISAPPOINTMENT."
"One of the best experiences I have had with a 3rd party developer from the Shopify store. Email communication was a breeze and as more of a designer, I really appreciated the help they give you with integrating the app. Yash was prompt and efficient, and gave me a great demo - they exceeded my expectations, and the app was seamlessly integrated into my theme with no issues, it works exactly as expected. They even installed another app which helped to improve the user experience without even being asked. I could not recommend them more."
"While the platform/interface was hard to use and didn't have a lot of instructions to guide you, the customer service was excellent and very quick. The best I've had so far with any shopify app. Yash was very attentive to my needs and quick to respond. He solved all of my problems on the spot!"
"I installed free version and found it very useful to enhance the customer experience in our store(Needab.com) .The interface is friendly user to configure and integrate. I feel , soon I  will go for paid version which they deserve . Thank you team."
Super friendly user interface easily integrates with the look of your website. loving the app so far!
"Simple and easy to set up, easy user interface. Certainly an app to add to your website, saves the hassle and helps potential customers. 
Thanks

Ugly interface but easy to use.
Easy enough to use but this has a very ugly interface.
Amazing app. easy to use. good user interface. Best part is they are very supportive when you face any issues or need any help. I must say they are more than 5+ rating. I wish the complete s4 team all the best and thanks a lot.
"Currently I am using this app for the newsletter/email popup only (for now) so my review focuses on that.
I have to say, when I first tried this app a few weeks ago I didn't like it. It felt overly complicated and confusing. I had to figure out how to tun off all of the things I didn't want. I played around with it for a while, but could never quite get what I wanted out of it. I will say that I just didn't put enough time into learning it.
In the meantime I tried a few other apps and found most of them to be lacking - especially in the design of the popup ability. I am VERY particular about the aesthetics of my site. 
I decided to give Swell another shot and spent a little more time with it. I am pleased to say that this is the app that I picked to move forward with. I have not found another app that allows for the flexibility in designing the popup windows, without coding, as much as this one. I had one question when setting up my coupon code and the support team answered within minutes.
If you are willing to spend a little time learning the interface and functions, this app will serve you well.
I know I am just using a small piece of this app, but as I explore the other features I'm confident that I will be able to customize them to suit my needs. I look forward to growing together with this company."
I am totally in love with the amazing features and easy to use interface. The email builder allows you so much flexibility and you are able to create such creative and professional emails. You will never find better support anywhere else! They are literally on call 24/7 and make sure all your queries are seen to. I will honestly never change my email provider....ever! Thanks guys.
"I have been using the Eprolo app for dropshipping about 2 years now. This app is by far better than Zendrop, CJ Dropshipping, uDroppy, SourceinBox, HyperSKU, and all the others by far (I've used all of them). The reason Eprolo is so much better is because of the easy to use interface and fast shipping with many great shipping options (plus they do quality inspections before shipping)! But overall perhaps the best part is their amazing customer service which is vital! I have my own personal customer service representative named Rosy! Rosy Ye is truly amazing at responding to me and very easy to understand! She has been helping me for awhile now and she adds tremendous value to Eprolo by working with me as if she's on my team! I've honestly never experienced such an amazing customer service representative like Rosy who is very committed and diligent to helping me achieve my goals! For this reason I highly recommend Eprolo - they have amazing personal customer service agents! (you get your own personal agent just for using the app!) The value of having your own agent (like Rosy) is amazing because it's like working directly with a personal dropshipping agent but instead of it only being them they work for this amazing company, Eprolo, which does amazing work to inspect your customers' products before shipment! If you're not sure about Eprolo let my testimony help you see that this app is truly the best and easiest to use! As mentioned, I've used all the other companies and their apps but I've always turned back to Eprolo because of their amazing customer service (Rosy is awesome), and their consistent results (reliable shipping times). Choose Eprolo you won't regret it!"
"Unquestionable 5 stars. Genuinely pleased.
As a single channel shopify eCommerce store, Veeqo is a really super cloud platform for a growing business struggling with the limitations of shopifys order management. 
They have a hugely dedicated support team which you can actually talk to on the phone included with every package they offer, this is a massive bonus for solving ops headaches quickly and easily. Few other shopify app order management solutions offered this level of support for such a low price. The Facebook app style bubble chat function is so cool too. Entering cost price data allows for stock valuation figures which helps for planning p&l and cash flows.
Allow up to 4 weeks for transferring over from shopify on 20 orders a day, with 1 week for interface learning. The simplicity of the platform is just fantastic because there is a no nonsense feeling of operating it. 
The few setbacks are likely unique to us because we are our own brand selling our own custom made products. This means the lack of customisations for reports and functionality may develop into pain points further down the line (we are growing at circa 275% p/a), but we can see this platform allowing seamless operations for a good 12-18 months. It should solve almost everything until then and is thus difficult to criticise!
Team Beaufort & Blake"
I only recently started using it and so far so good. I like it's easy to use interface.
So Far So Good....Mush Easier Interface then the other Apps
Great application. Eaasy to use and I like the interface. Great job!
Easy user interface and great pricing. Free shipping is awesome! Eprolo does a great job communicating regarding questions about specific products.
"We used this app earlier in 2016 and saw a big increase in the website's conversion rate by simply offering a ""subscribe and get 5% off your order"". It also resulted in a big number of emails collection as well, which is great because email marketing is super profitable for our business.
We recently tried one of the email pop-up boxes instead of this app for a month as a test and the conversion rate was lower so we've switched back to the Email Collection Bar.
It is non-annoying, and it stays there until the customer is ready to pop their email in and get their discount.
MUCH better than all of the classic pop up in your face boxes, and also-- it is super easy to set up and will not wreck your website user experience. In fact it improves it."
I'm sure that every negative star review didn't test this app/plugin properly or contacted the customer service. This is one of my favorite working apps with a convenient and easy interface. The plugin works and looks great on every template and the customer service is the best. Special thanks to John whom helped us with this huge problem caused by several apps. Only he was the one that gave 110% and fixed the issue.
Really works as intended it! Nice interface and useful data fetch. Heatmap captures exactly screens used. Keep up with good work!
"Incredible livechat app! Integrated seamlessly with Messenger and a super user friendly interface. A steal for both the free, basic option as well as paid! Customer service becomes much easier and helps with conversions when potential buyers understand what they're purchasing on the spot. 
Thank you for making such a stellar app!"
"Great and intuitive app, lots of useful features. It's very helpful for filtering products, easy to setup, and it really improves the user experience in your online store.
And the customer support is top notch!"
"Free, clean, very nice interface... frankly nothing to complain about. I'll come back with 5 stars when I've viewed my first recording.
Done. Just perfect!"
Great app and great costumer service. Looks really professional and good interface to work with. Recommended
Great app - easy to use and awesome customer service. It's got a great customisable design and interface. Would recommend.
This is does work and get the job done. I love the interface and simplicity of us. Definitely recommend.
"Great app. Simple interface and no glitches. Also 10,000 views is quite a lot.
Good job guys.
Couple of features to add are a) to be able to delete recordings and b) not record your own session."
"The features are extremely useful and detailed. For example in the filter you can have a filter inside a filter to give you an extremely sophisticated filter solving all your filter needs in case of a huge and variety full catalogue. Moreover the search is intuitive and covers almost everything. They give you a ton of other small features like infinite scroll, sorting according to availability, not showing the products out of stock and more. All this with a very smooth and easy to use interface and excellent excellent customer support. Livia was amazing ! I did not write excellent twice by mistake, these guys are actually that goood :) - Nitish, team TheBTclub"
"Just like that this app is called 'ULTIMATE TRUST', yes we can absolutely ULTIMATE TRUST the Bear people. Works perfect and no complicated coding which many other co thought merchants are also software developer. Conversion Bears app by far provide the most friendly interface and any computer nerds can use it too. Great support Ms. Lynda! Simply awesome! :)"
Have been using Tidio Live Chat App for a little over 2 weeks now and can safely say this is the best Live Chat App out there and every website should have this installed. Best thing about it is you can manage Live Chats wherever you go and their user interface is the easiest to use out of all Live Chats. Its simple smart and great to use.
"Amazing apps. A must have for any website. Great interface, intuitive bot, friendly and fast support. Highly recommend to anyone. Definitely an A+."
"Love this app very easy to use, great interface. Support is 100%, i chatted till 10.30pm. The bot will save us loads of time."
I used this app personally. It has the best user experience and also solutions to all problems for the abondened sessions
i like the User experience of the app its very good no issues really reccomend. really shows why customers dont checkout etc
"The app works great, and exactly what I needed. We installed the app primarily so we could filter our products by the variants, without having to use tags (you still can though if needed). Also because the app gives you the option to hide out of stock variants when the customer is filtering that size and/or colour. After installing the developers introduced analytics what is brilliant for seeing what people and filtering and searching for. With the added extra of seeing how many sales you've got from customers using the search & filter. There's so many other features you can also use, which just adds an ever better user experience, and increases your conversion rate. I'd also like to thank the app team (especially Henry) for helping me with a customisation problem I had. They were fast and fixed the problem for me straight away! This is by far the best filter & search app on the Shopify app store, you won't be disappointed!"
"1 week into installing this - Great app that has added a whole new depth to our site and user experience. Support team is reliable and efficient! Great find, highly recommended."
We've been using this app to make our navigation and search easier for customers. It's made our user experience 5 times better. Support team is very helpful as well.
"Love the interface, very easy to get set up, if you call a toggle a setup process lol. Note like any of the others you can only see up to the cart page."
"Great user interface, fast support via instant chat, has great features in the free plan. Strongly recommended."
"Awesome awesome awesome.
The amazing team customized everything to my needs they are truly the best. The app is amazing the interface is easy to use and to set up I highly recommend this app if you're looking for an easy to use and set up filter and search app thanks guys and John!"
"I have normally always been religious towards Zopim Live Chat, but i had a look at Tidio and the chat design was very appealing and refreshing. Now besides that, you can't customize it in many ways, to make it fit your website perfectly.
There are also a Desktop and Mobile apps, which work very well.
The dashboard and interface of the app is also super well done - And now recently i just found out that there are automations in this chat app as well, which looks REALLY promising, conversion wise.
Oh yea.. And their customer support A+"
"We switched from tidio back to another more expensive solution. But after a few months we noticed that less people used the chat so we switched back to tidio. We ran into some problems when they updated the interface (it was loading 2 times, both the new and the old interface due to the re-install). Contacted Tidio, and it was solved within 2 minutes. Great customer service, great app!"
"The app is superb for increasing the ""trust"" rate to your store. And the options provided are better than the other apps I have tried.
But apart from all, the assistance, respect and quick response from Lynda is what highlights my user experience.....especially being new to eCommerce and requiring every bit of help that can be offered.  
Best of Luck Team!

"I like it, very easy interface. But do not understand it is work or not...Will see."
Love the support and love the app all the way from its interface to efficiency. A must need for you stores:)
Used this for quite a while and worked well. I got notifications on my mobile too which was very helpful. Its got a user friendly interface and easy to set up in minutes. The support on this app (even on a free version) is superb! Keep up the great work guys!
"Interface is pretty nice and seems to be a good app.
But the thing is nothing works as you want... Automatic message block everything, says operator is busy when i am online.
And when i write to customer service with chat, when I press enter i go backline instead of sending the message! that was a waste of time for me using that"
"Initially I had tried Beeketing's FB messenger integration but was having major issues getting notifications on my phone -- seemed to be an issue with FB messenger, not beeketing, but still made their app less than great. (also, some of my customers don't have Facebook!!!) I switched to Tidio, using the free version -- glad I made the change, the interface is great for both my customers and me. 
I like that they have an app for iOS - I think they have it for android too. Excellent chat management all around, the app is nicely organized and the notifications work. Interestingly you can also hook your FB page messenger up to this and actually receive notifications! 2 birds, 1 app, fam. 
Also worth noting that the live chat feature doesn't cut into my theme AT ALL, not on the checkout page or add to cart button for desktop or mobile, and I'm using the Debut theme. If anything, it's even more out of the way, doesn't interfere with scrolling. Everything is professional. I haven't looked into their automation features yet but plan to soon. 
Install was really fast. Actually under 20 seconds. A+ all around!"
"The user interface is elegant and, as you might expect, their live chat customer service helped me with set-up. Quick and easy. We're using the free version and it's the best live chat experience I've seen."
"Amazing app.
Simple and easy to use.
Video tutorial is very helpful.
a simple interface
and it's all free."
"Great App, very useful and user friendly, i recommend , it helped me to improve user experience and to fix some faults that i maked"
"Amazing app and a must have! Hands down.
Their API response is way too quick and exceeded my expectations. If I toggle my status from Tidio Android app from the phone, it reflects the status on my site in less than a second. BLAZING FAST! 
On top of that, the chat and backend interface is way too user-friendly and modern.
These guys know what they are doing! Keep it up!"
"I tried several filters before settling on this one. There are some CLEAR differences between some of the ""also rans"" and Boost's filter. First, this filter function even if you are re-syncing your collections / inventory. Some of the others' filters disappear during the sync process which hamstrings your user experience for upwards of 20 mins, if your catalog is big like mine. Secondly, this app is WELL thought out. It works like it should and gives you all kinds of customization. Thirdly, it's fast. The filtering works quickly. Fourth, the support is ridiculously fast and accommodating. You can certainly find filters that cost less, but having tried several of them, I've concluded that the functionality of this one is well worth the cost. Very glad I have this on my site!"
"Really quite easy to set up and a simple, clean interface. Most of the work is simply tagging your products with keywords, everything else is a breeze."
This app was easy to install and add to my website. The interface is easy to customize and this is perfect for our needs. Thank you.
Great support in setting up the app in our store.  Nice clean look and interface on both desktop and mobile.
I used this app to gain shopper browse patterns and it is excellent for ecommerce intelligence.  It is a very easy to use app.  The video recordings show very clearly what is happening with user experience. Many thanks
Great App! Easy User interface and great customer support :)
"i have tried many live chats out there but this i must say this has the best user experience and very simple dashboard. 
I had a problem with the installation and the team did everything they can to solve it and indeed they did. Fantastic support and fantastic app. There is no other free app that offers this level of service. 
Facebook offers live chat but its restricted to facebook users only. then you get the other ones that claim to be free and you install it and find it out its not free and restricted to a number of chats. This app really broadens the whole scope and they even have automated messages for users that enter a site and leave the site. Well done developers."
"This app is incredible. I'm able to see nearly all my customers' sessions clearly, and that helped me optimize the user experience of my site. Highly recommended."
"The #1 app for Conversational Commerce! An e-commerce must, especially for introducing new products in complicated markets, by helping consumers connect with your brand value. Modern design, smart interface..the dashboard could be a little easier in navigation, but awesome! Pro Account is worth every cent :)"
"Great app! It does what it says. Very simple and easy interface, and the navigation is good. I am able to see what my customers do on my shop, and hopefully i will be able to increase my conversion rates with this knowledge :)
5 stars"
Great App! Really happy with how simple and easy the interface is. Not a complex setup and works like a charm!
"Very intuitive interface.  So far so good. . .

"I am testing this app now, and I currently enjoy it a lot. I hope this app can help me better improve our user experience and engagement."
"The app works well and the support is fast and great. The only negative is there's no synonym function, which is pretty important for my business and improving our user experience. When they add synonym control, then I'll upgrade to a 5 star."
"I used this app to produce pdf invoices for customers and our own bookkeeping records. The app does what it's supposed to do and is easy to use. You can customise the templates you want to use. The admin interface is laid out in an easy to use manner and is almost idiot proof. Customer service is responsive through their in-app chat widget and deals with issues immediately. I had cause to contact Customer service to assist with set up and store verification and found Marcus could set me up almost instantly, he was courteous and very helpful. So far so good I would recommend this app to produce PDF invoices. We use AVADA's SEO optimiser so we have a high expectation on the quality of their apps from using them successfully"
"Very easy to install, great customer service and user friendly interface. Truly a 'one click install'."
"This app  makes the user experience SO much better. They can easily sort and filter products by certain attributes, and multiple attributes as well. Customer support was fast and friendly. Thank you!"
I have just upgraded to the Pro version as the tool is effective and helps grow sales. Easy to use and good user interface on the website.
Just started using Replay Live and find it very useful to see how our customer review our store and we can further improve on the user experience.
"it is very useful! have a fast speed! friendly interface, very easy. helpful, I like it so much! GOOD!!"
"Great software, really helped us figure out our user experience. Highly recommend it! Huge Thank you"
"I've tried most of the chat apps on Shopify. Tidio Live Chat is by far the best app, with a very fair price point per operator.
The interface is clean, super easy to use, and you can be up in running in less than 2 minutes!
I like the fact that the chat window appears as the business itself, and when an operator joins the customers chat, the chat window changes from 'the business' to the operator. 
There are choices from a variety of looks, with tons of customization options, being able to customize your chat however you want or put it on it's own page on your site if you prefer. Knowing what your customers are looking at on your site, or where they may be getting stuck is a sweet feature.
Tidio also has an app for android and ios that performs well. The app has notification options so you can hear new chats or visitors coming in while on the road. I can't stress enough how much of a needed feature that is.
I'm glad I tried this app, and I'm positive you will be too.

"Works well out of the box and easy to install/customise; early days, so will ""review"" this review idc with better user experience input.  Until then, recommended by www.thesolidbarcompany.com"
"Esse Aplicativo é Sensacional. Eu não sou muito de avaliar até porque muitos fazem propaganda enganosa, agora quando encontramos um aplicativo desse nível, é Obrigação avaliar!!!
Super simples de ler as informações, tem a interface limpa, não é pesado, e repassa informações valiosíssimas.
Só tenho a agradecer aos idealizadores, muito obrigado"
It made my life soo easier. I can now see the sessions of customers who visited the website and come up with ways to improve their user experience.  Love it! I highly recommend it for your store!
"I've tried three different chat apps. I love this one the best. When it comes to investing in an app that will benefit my site I do careful research and testing. This is the best so far and worth the value.
www.victoryteacompany.com - see how it looks on our site.
Has moblie app so I can stay online on the go.
Has a nice desktop interface. 
Customizable.
Automation options and online/offline option. 
Lightweight."
"We at BeautifulThins.com have used Tidio Live Chat for some time now. During this time we have tried using other chats available on the market and came to conclusion that Tidio, our first choice, is still the best option. Tidio amazed us with with its broad functionality and easy to use interface and that all available on the free plan (which is especially important for us at the moment, as we are a young company). Tidio also positively surprised us with a mobile app and a chrome extension, these 2 are really useful and make you as a business ""always online"" and ready to help our customers when needed, not only when we are specifically logged in on shopify chat. We particularly like, that we can set up the view of our chat (business style or modern), the sounds that gives us info if someone came to our page, possibility to see from which browser and country the customer is browsing our page. All very convenient and gives needed info at one glance! So, thank you Tidio team, we really enjoy your App!"
Very interesting to see how users navigate.  Is helping us to improve the user experience.  Will continue to collect data and incrementally make changes.
Thanks so much for the developers allowing this to be free! The interface for the backend is so clean and it helps us to understand what we need to work on in the backend for our web!
"Clean interface, does what it is supposed to do well. This app has given me a lot of insight as to how my customers act. Thank you."
"First of all, this App is the best filter feature I have seen on Shopify marketplace. It's very helpful to our website's user experience.
And the support team is quite professional and quick responsive, they helped me to solve the integration with my theme.
Everything is perfect!"
"This app is very different than competitors. It directly integrates with your theme’s style. User experience is very carefully considered. Everything works smooth and perfectly.
Besides the support team is very responsive and solves problems promptly.
Thanks for creating this app"
We at www.ethical-trading.com a new online store dedicated to selling you wholesome products chose Tidio for our client interface and appreciate the fantastic support given by Olek.
"Well, installation and setup was easy, you can manage multiple stores using the same interface which is really great. Would like to continue with the basic version of the same."
It works great. Beautiful interface design and easy to use. Thank you!
Nice app with instant and friendly support.Good user interface. Would definitely recommend.
"Very easy to use in terms of good and descriptive user interface. Everything you need to manage SEO in the shop is included in this app. The things you do not need, is not included. It is simply excellent and all Shopify users SHOULD have this."
Great app with a very easy interface.
"Great! Easy to use, nice user interface, overall great app."
"This app is great! Easy to use, great interface, and excellent customer service. Highly recommended!"
"A clean user interface, with detailed recordings like browser, OS, even precise location was an amazing feature surely better than other similar Shopify apps. Looking forward to seeing integrated chat support."
aweeesssomme I like the interface and all the capabilities that this app has to offer
"Too early to notice any difference but really like the idea.
It's a very simple and fast interface to update your meta tags.
Hopefully this will increase my rankings on seach engines."
"great app, works smoothly with my app and easy to manage with good user interface and simple intergation"
"This application is very useful, it can help you analyze the behavior of your customers after entering your store and improve the user experience, find the cause and solve it, one of the best application so far."
"The invoice looks rather ugly. 
Cant map it to my brand color.
Otherwise easy interface and setup. I appreciate making something like this for free."
"This application is very useful, it can help you analyze the behavior of your customers after entering your store and improve the user experience, find the cause and solve it, one of the best application so far."
Intuitive interface and great customer support! Mobile interface is also excellent. Worked seamlessly with Shopify
Very quick turnaround. The setup was a breeze and the interface is very user friendly. Easy Breezy.
Very good application for SEO. I really liked the interface. Simple and elegant. I think it could be in several languages ​​to make it easier.
"First time using an email delivery service and this was SO easy. Love how simple the interface is. Lots of personalization options. If you’re on the fence, leap!"
"Easy install, simple interface and nice design. What more could you ask?

"We have products with a ton of variants and this app really helped us create a better user experience. At times, not all variants are in stock so the filters really help customer narrow the search down quickly. Customer service was quick to help with little tweaks I needed."
"Very easy to edit in bulk, easy to use interface. Must have if your shopify store has a lot of products."
"its a great application with a great easy interface .... and easy to use ....
i love it ... the more here its totally free"
"This is one of the greatest apps I have ever used. I have been with Vela for almost 2 years, and have stuck by the amazing company ever since. They truly are trying to change the way efficiency is done, and the simplicity of it is great! From the smallest businesses, to big ones, you can change descriptions, titles, images, prices, literally everything is available to edit but at scale. As soon as you publish the updates, within a couple minutes (depending on the amount of edits) the edits are live before anyone even notices!
Thank you Vela for this amazing app, & your support is AMAZING (answers and fixes my problems instantly). You are way ahead of the competition with a way better interface and ease of use ❤️"
"amazing to be able to see an exact screen video of a customers user experience, this will really help improve our site."
"Excellent app, easy to use interface and on top of it all, a great customer support team that works round the clock to make you succeed. Could not have asked for a better Shopify app to make an iOS and Android app for our store distacart.com. Kudos to the team and please keep it up.
I only wish you would auto generate the app code and let us generate the app file with the click of a button. Can’t wait for this"
Excellent customer service - you only need to wait a few seconds to get an answer on the chat. The person who answered my questions was friendly and helpful. The interface of the app is also excellent!
App provides an easy way to add tabs to display additional product information in a user-friendly way. The app interface is great and allows for multiple customization options. Support is very prompt and friendly too!
This is the 2nd app I tried for creating product tabs and it was easy to install and customize. Based on my user experience I would recommend. I still need to play with the detailed customizing but it has been simple to use this far.
"Just finished setting up Rivo - an interface you actually enjoy, lots of language and branding customisation options, and excellent customer service."
"Customer support for S Loyalty is amazing and really blows the competition out of the water. Their response time is hands down the fastest and most comprehensive that we've encountered thus far with ANY Shopify app. The app is straightforward to use. Even though we've just launched it is obvious that the loyalty program is a big draw. The interface is clean, customizable, and professional. We highly recommend S Loyalty!"
"I downloaded Rivo and found it to be the best loyalty app so far. The interface is clean, the customer support is super nice!! and I like how it's not as overwhelming as other apps I've tried. It syncs seamlessly with my store and just makes life a lot simpler. Thank you Rivo!"
"Very slick app. One of the best I have used on Shopify. Normally I have to email the support crew a number of questions when setting up external apps, but this interface was very intuitive and easy to use. And the main thing.... is it is a great product: It looks very professional; was easy to make it fit with our sites design; and the backend has been working perfectly!
Also, the customer service is exceptional!! Quick, Clear & Concise. Perfect!"
"Quite easy to set up, I sell digital services and can see potential in this. I was not forced to leave a 5 star review as many reviewers have pointed out. The interface is fairly simple to use, the price seems very fair, pretty cheap for racking me an extra $100 on my first day, good stuff!

"I downloaded Rivo and found it to be the best loyalty app so far. The interface is clean, and I like how it's not as overwhelming as other apps I've tried. It syncs seamlessly with my store and just makes life a lot simpler."
It's a great user experience and well designed!
"Good app so far, easy to set up, great dashboard/interface.  Four stars only because doesn't work with mobile.  I highly recommend it!"
Of all the apps we installed S Loyalty had the smoothest and most well put together process and user interface.  We are hopeful that it will continue to ecxeed our expectations.
"Very impressive.  Simple to set up and the interface for the customer is elegant without our having to adjust (we have the basic service).  I had one question and customer service was quick to answer.  Seems to be well integrated with Shopify (but I have yet to fully test as only launched today).  
I would like to see the help files updated but other than that, I have no issues.  
We'll definitely consider the Refer-a-Friend and Fan Builder.  
Keep up the good work."
"Very impressed so far.  Several very useful functions such as repeating alarm notification - previous chats appearing above your conversation etc.
I have used a number of chat services and this one is a perfect blend between affordability and great function.
Works beautifully in tandem with my mobile too  - All very seemless and I love the fact even the alarm tone is the same.
It all makes a difference and improves the experience.
Customer interface is very clear - and pro - active rules ensure I pop up to help my customers at the right moments - Cannot fault it."
"Really great app - it has an easy to use interface and does what I need it to.
Additionally, their customer service and support is exceptional. They really go above and beyond to support their users."
"Great tool, but the interface is not very user friendly."
"Amazing app, does exactly what I want it to. The user interface is immaculate and very well thought-out.
Adding an Instagram Feed to your store is made simple with this App - thank you guys!"
"We've tried every chat app for Shopify, and Chatra is hands down the best!  It's personal, has a beautiful interface, and most importantly, has directly increased our sales.  Customers love using it when they have a small question before ordering and can see that someone is online to answer it quickly."
"As they said, it's better than all other apps' paid versions. The interface is a bit basic, but this app has everything that I need. The customer service so far is also great."
"So far so good. I've seen a growth in our sales once we added the customer loyalty program. It was easy to set up, and had a clean interface."
"Does what it promises, great interface"
"If there were 6 stars I'd click on it!
I can't say enough about the level of support that this company offers. To be quite honest, I've never run into a group of professionals quite as dedicated as the ones at NexusMedia. Integration of these tabs was simple and any customization that was not offered directly in the user interface was quickly taken care of by them. Their response time is phenomenal! If you're thinking about adding tabs to your descriptions, EasyTabs is the only way to go as far as I'm concerned.
What a wonderful experience!
Thank you NexusMedia!"
"Works great, couldn’t be happier! Very Simple interface and easy to use navigation. Works seamlessly on my Shopify store."
"SLoyalty is a great app for any site, very easy to implement and a simple interface. Highly reccommended!"
Best chat app ever. I've only been using it a few days and I absolutely love it. The interface usability is all around top notch. I really like the insights I get around knowing who is online in real time and what they are doing. Really well done. Definitely recommend it!
"Really like this app, easy interface and insights, great customisation tool and Betty is was super helpful throughout! Highly recommend as it also converts!"
"We installed this app in minutes and it works like a charm. We implemented all three programs... the loyalty program, the fan builder, and the refer-a-friend. It has definitely increased sales, email signups, and Facebook followers. Very intuitive interfaces... we love it and highly recommend this to app!"
"The installation went without incident and the user interface is intuitive. I've found that the visitor's interface does not render well if on a mobile device, which is to say that it does not flip when turning your device. Overall, support has been good. The application has a desktop notification feature which works well for our customer service folks. The target chat feature needs some additional explanations as to how each rule functions. A YouTube training video would probably be beneficial in assisting users. The saved-replies work as expected which is a time saver for our customer service folks.I also love that you can customize their chat widget and change the location of where the widget is presented. The response time on the application between the customer and the customer service rep. is acceptable and being able to see the text that the customer is typing prior to them submitting is a fabulous time saving feature. Overall, I'm very happy with my initial findings on the application and look forward to them adding additional features which could push this application over the top. If you are seeking a light weight customer service chat application for your store, this application is more than sufficient. If you are looking for more analytics and feature-rich chat platform, this might not be your first choice."
Very useful. Interface is nice. Easy to use
Positive experience thus far. Intuitive interface and easy to setup. Our customers are accumulating points and they're happier for it. We'd recommend it.
"This is a great app! The chat window is simple with a large setting and view.  User experience is up to expectations. Our shopify plan is the basic plan and with this app, a basic plan can work like a super plan. Worth having it installed! Yaakov is a very helpful guy! He is always there to help whenever you need help on the app. He is a babywearer too!"
"I feel bad giving it less than 3 stars, but it doesn't really deserve it. The interface is beautiful and very easy to find what you need. However, you get what you pay for. I was very excited about finding a feature rich chat app at this price, but that's where the pros stop. Customization is very very limited... don't be fooled by the screenshots and website. You can change colors in the dashboard of your chat window ONLY. If you want to change other colors you have to use API. Also, customizable text is very limited. You only have a very few number of places where you can customize text shown before the chat. Nothing after, during, etc. The only thing I love about it is that you can see the customers cart and where they are on your webpage. Also, no close chat button for customer. Even if operator closes chat, customer still sees it as active. Chatra had a lot of potential but fell short.

"Works well for us, especially on mobile to saves endless scrolling of info and makes the user experience much better"
I think I tried 4 other tab apps before settling on this one. The instructions and user interface are intuitive and easy to use and it works well on my site. I ran into a few issues and support fixed them for me immediately. Highly recommended.
loving this app! easy to use with straight forward interface. Get it today!
"Just installed, used it with a few visitors. A really simple, yet powerful tool to keep your visitors engaged. Loved the intuitive interface to see what visitors are typing. 
One thing that will make Chatra the best available chat app is visitor insight and information like page views, current page, location, IP etc even if there is no chat contact initiated. This is available in a few other apps, but would love to see this on Chatra."
"What a difference Chatra has made to our site.  In the 10 days we have been using the app, we have captured three sales either directly or indirectly related to our ability to take questions directly from customers, in real time.
The interface is easy enough to use, even us Luddites figured it out in seconds.  Installation and activation was instant, and we were configured and up and running in minutes.  I can't stress enough how simple the process was - so happy about that!
As we looked deeper into the app, we found other customization options that we are now using, including auto-away and some other useful options.
Simply an amazing tool to augment our relationship-building and customer relations initiatives.  Bravo!"
"I highly recommend the the brilliant team at Nexus Media. Their support and communication is second to none! 
EasyTabs gives me the functionality I need for my store. Lengthy product descriptions are great for a number of reasons, but they start to look messy. Being able to organize your content into tabs is fantastic for site aesthetics and user experience. I should also mention that because tabs are mobile-friendly, they're actually great for SEO.
5 Stars."
"Perfect for keeping in contact with customers and tire kickers. 
I've been using Chatra.io for the last few weeks and it has already had
an impact on my customer service and sales. From the well-designed iOS
app, to the online interface, and the creative customer-naming system,
to avoid treating anonymous customers like numbers, everything has been
first class.
I used another chat client previously, but did not like having to use my
IM client. The dedicated client here helps me filter out business IMs
from personal IMs and texts.
A few things that might be nice additions would be the ability to always
see the current page a customer is on. You can see this sometimes, but
not always. Another useful thing would be the ability to push a popover-
lightbox style offer based on a particular customer. For example, maybe
I see somebody in Libya (this just happened) and send an offer of
discounted shipping (the lightbox makes it look more like it ""just happened"" and less stalkerish than an IM. :))
These are minor quibbles. Chatra.io is an essential tool for using your
website to communicate with customers instead of hiding behind it."
"Makes it easy to organize the information on my product pages.  Adjusts to accordian view on mobile pages, which improves the user experience in my opinion.  Easy to install and maintain."
"This is incredibly powerful app and has changed the game for our little business. Were planning on scaling our reach and will be heavily relying on the solution. If you can spare the time to customize the interface it will also have that visual feel quality that businesses are looking for. 
www.boxoftrips.com/"
Amazed at the quick response by the team.  I requested a slight tweak at how the app interfaced with my theme.  They were so helpful and handled the request really quickly.  The app is very easy to use and really goes with the clean look of my store.  I am VERY happy!
"Works perfectly for our store. The tech support is very fast and responsive. Twice we requested the team for troubleshooting and installation, and it was resolved in less than an hour.
Will highly recommend the app for some who wants to divide the product description under different headers for a cleaner user experience."
"We just changed themes and needed a way to connect multiple products with multiple size charts since our new theme only allowed for 3 different size charts.  I tried out a few different Size Chart apps but I hit the mother-load when I found ""Kiwi Sizing Chart"".  The interface was easy to use, the Live Chat Support was super responsive, and the size charts connected effortlessly to my new theme. I didn't have to touch a line of code and the charts look GREAT!"
"User interface is pretty difficult to navigate. Installation is not simple and once it is installed, there's not a lot you can do to customize it. This needs work."
"User Interface - check
Functionality - check
Live support - check
App installation - check
I am giving a five start rating because so far this has been the best and easy to use app for a marketplace. Especially the reason that it allows manual payout of commission for cases that has to do with CASH ON DELIVERY. 
This app has helped my store multiply tremendously in product volume with a very short period of time.  Now i can include more category options to enable more volumes of products."
"It was such a great experience from the get-go till the launch. I have installed and tried all app builders to make sure I will start with the best. Shopney is the easiest to design. It has great INTEGRATIONS and some features that the others don't offer like in-app messages. 
User experience is top-notch with clean dashboard. The support team was always kind and helpful from the moment I start and still answering my endless questions :) They helped or guided me for every single step. So, the nightmare turned into a mobile fairytale.
I highly recommed it!"
"Does exactly what it promises. Great looking size guides that automatically follow our site's theme, easy to use interface and great customer service (I suggested a feature, they added it without question). Definitely worth the cost."
"The application works exactly as described by the creator, it does exactly what I was looking for, very easy to use, intuitive interface, very affordable, plus the support is excellent. Highly recommended!"
"Thank you for the free app! I think the interface can be improved to make it clear to the customer that they are getting a special deal for a product because they bought or about to buy the product int heir shopping cart. Let me know if you like some ideas, I'm and architect and a graphic designer :)"
"First off this is as honest it's gonna get. This app was created by geniuses, with an easy to use interface. It provides automatic video editing using one one of there templates which saved me hours. I don't write reviews but I had to for this. Your loss if this isn't already installed."
"A great little app to add your size charts into the home, collection or product pages or a mix of the three. Simple dashboard interface that ensures the correct size charts appear in the correct places in your store. A huge time saver."
"Most of us can do a little bit of code.. but do yourself a favour and don't attempt TABS. Just instal this and it makes life super easy. Laying out your product descriptions into relevant sections really improves the user experience and makes life super easy for customers to go straight to what they want to refer to .. features, ingredients.. keeping it all compact is crucial and really neatens up mobile layout etc.
I'm a conversion freak and so having a neat theme and as much tightly laid out product details above the fold will increase my sales. This totally allows me to write a lot of content about a product but for it not to be all the way down the page.
Denys was really helpful .. and on a Sunday too! My theme wouldn't allow instant access to the app but Denys helped me out really fast.
Realistically tabs should be built in and they will be one day, but for now I'd highly recommend this app. 
nb if you want to see one cleaver trick this app allowed me to do see here:
http://www.essenzzahealth.com/products/anti-aging-antioxidant-face-12-masks
It allows me to neatly frame a video widget inside my product tabs, really neatly not like when on the page normally ... more customer engagement results,"
No Doubt the greatest App ever for making the perfect size chart. Use this app for a minute and instantly fell in love with it. It's simple interface makes it so easy to use and also offers a nice template that will look good on your store. Great customer service that answers any questions rapidly and in a really nice way. Would definitely recommend this app to everyone!
We are so glad someone designed an app that would work so well with our shopify store! The interface is smooth easy to use and has many great features our customers have and will enjoy.
Really nice popup. Great support as well. Love the simple interface and possibility to adjust the popup.
"Excellent app for small business like eshopping. Excellent Customer Service coming from the co-founder himself so the urgency to fix the problem is efficient. 
What's important is that I don't have to spend thousands of dollars to have a mobile/iPad interface for our clients. eshopping (www.eshopping.com.ph) will be a long time client of ShopPad!"
"It has a friendly user interface, and was easy to install. Customer service was fast and friendly, would definitely recommend this app."
"I think it's an excellent app, I am however wondering if there are plans for an iPhone/android interface?"
"So far so good. Good quality and prices. Easy interface to use to create product. It says 2-3 day shipping. We will see.  Will change review after a full month of service. 
**Update: The shipping was excellent and the print was very well done. Great quality shirts, bags, water bottles. I will be using you guys with confidence.

"This app reaches parts of your code that others cannot do. Simple, intuitive, easy to use interface for a SEO newbie."
Nice app.  It gives you a very iPady interface.
"really not made for international shipping.I ordered a sample a month ago. after tones of email finally got a reply. i have to look for my order over the entire country looking for a number which is not a tracking number. THEY  DONT CARE about your order. 
but... I do recommend this app inside the  US. good quality. great interface and very easy to use. you can add a layer on top of another layer and this is great, you can add your logo. lots of items to choose from. fast fast fast shipping. friendly and fast reply from customer service. 
the problem is ...they switching to the dark side when you have to ship internationally. no reply. no support. everything is completely different.  you have to find your package.and this is not great."
"I used this app to set up a newsletter subscriber on the store. This app is great and easy to set up. I really like the interface of this app. The customer support is great. ""Esmeralda"" from the support team removed the BRANDING WATERMARK from the popup in no time. Thanks again."
"this app is a time saver for sure, but it could do with being a bit more customisable with an easier interface!

easy to use and great interface! waiting to see if this increases conversions
"Very easy to use interface, which allows user to setup badges quickly."
"Customer service was very quick, kind & helpful. The app has everything I need and it's simple to use, with beautiful interface. Love it."
"App does not work as advertised. Waste of hours of setup and reading about how to put this into our store. 
The product lists do not refresh. Product search to setup BOGO's after they are 'hidden' will never show in the list - we have 60,000 products and paging through 100 at a time to find your newly created hidden product is no practical. 
User interface is horrible. Requires multiple apps to install for a simple BOGO offer to generate."
"I'm impressed with how easy it is to use the Product Upsell app. The interface is straight-forward and easy to use. The setup videos and instructions were easy to follow. Customer service via chat is super responsive, fast and helpful.  Navjot helped me on several occasions and she's a Ninja superstar guru all the way! Thank you for all your help! Your expertise and support is much appreciated!"

I wouldn't be in business without customcat. Very easy to use interface and top notch customer service
"The app has a terrible interface unlike it predecessors modern easy to use interface. Plus the main reason for uninstalling is that they force you to use the vendor name of ""CustomCat."" Thats totally contradictory of making self branded merchandise. Not sure why they do this, by all means they don't have to since other on demand services don't require it, but it's likely a selfish from of marketing for them. Beware!  Printful and Gooten are much better and more customizable."
"This is one of the worst services I've ever used, the production time is too long, I have ordered from December 3rd to December 17th I have not received an order tracking code, and do not know when it is received, the shipping rate is broken and too much confusion, poor printing quality, bad design interface, unfriendly interface, long customer response time, faulty printing, cut text, excessive blurring and inaccuracy of the original design position, no refund policy for the customer, lost in transit but not refundable, if possible I will give 0.001 stars. Too disappointed"
Javid is the man! He did what i need in a few seconds. I love this app. It is a great interface to have with shopify!
Great App. The interface is easy to use.  Customer service is fantastic. Keep doing a great job CustomCat.
"TLDR: I love this company. I've had several months experience with them on multiple levels and they have rocked it out every time. 
I was a little skeptical about using CustomCat as my primary DTG company when I first read their reviews. I'm really glad I took a chance, 
I've been using these guys for several months. I've had many orders and yes, there have been a few glitches ( it's going to happen no matter where you go.) 
I'm giving these guys a five star rating because I think they deserve it. I tried to use a few other companies and either creating your products is a nightmare or their pricing is ridiculous. I've attempted to create products with just about every single company out there at the moment, and I kept coming back to CustomCat. 
Pricing is amazing. I'm only using the Lite version and I'm still getting great margin and having room to test different price points and offer some sweet discounts and still come out well on top. If I sign up for their paid version that gets even better and basically two sales pays for it a month. No brainer. 
As I said, there have been a few glitches and I had those glitches sorted out quickly and efficiently and I adore their customer service. To test out customer service I sent an issue through email, phone and Facebook messenger and all were answered in a timely manner. Customer service has always been kind and professional and I enjoy having them get my back. 
I have had excellent order quality. I had to make some adjustments to my files but the printing and quality of everything I have received from CC has been excellent. My test order has become some of my favorite items in my own wardrobe. However, do your due diligence! Check the quality of your images and the sizes and make a test order to check the quality of some of the garments. Some of the t-shirt models are not super premium quality and you can't expect amazing quality from a sub-par garment, but these guys have a lot of choices in high quality garments to make a good margin without having to go with the cheapest item listed. 
What Could Be Better: 
The user interface is a little too barebones and it takes a minute to get the hang of it. I highly recommend watching CC's YouTube tutorials before getting started because there are a lot of short cuts that aren't very apparent before you know they exist. 
The product images could be a little better done for the hats and some of the lesser offered items. It would be cool to have a model mock up option like Printful.
It would be awesome also if they offered some of the new options that others are offering such as being able to send a sticker with your orders or title things like that. I'm sure those things are coming. 
I waited a month before I left this review because I wanted to get the full picture before I just left one. I'm glad I waited because now I know I have faith in the fact that these guys are my number 1 go-to POD supplier and I am looking forward to a long and happy relationship with them. I'll be sure to change my review if that ever changes but for now I'm glad I found them!"
I am fan of Code Belt and this shipping calculator I would say is their magnum opus. it engages customers thus improving user experience and minimizes bounce rate. highly recommended!
I've been wanting to find a pop up app for a while that is easily integrated into Shopify and Rivo is absolutely perfect and is exactly what I've been after. Other apps I've used are always difficult to navigate and don't consider the user experience but Rivo has been great. After jumping on the app and having a couple questions I was immediately connected with a team member (James) and he was so great and helpful. He even recorded a personalised video which gave me a great run through of the app. Amazing app and amazing service! Will definitely recommend to all my small biz friends!
"Amazing app and very easy to use
loved the interface and quick customer service
would recommend this to everyone"
Love this app! Will be using this app from now on. Very clean interface and has no additional charge. Easy to use and is straight to the point which is something we prefer since we have a load of work to do. So happy to have found this app and would highly recommend it to others. Plus I had the most refreshing customer service ever!
"I've only recently starting using this app, but so far great customer service so and easy interface."
"This is my review so far...
I really want custom cat to be my POD provider... but their customer service is pretty bad. So far it's taking days to get answers to questions, and then I get a cut and paste response... They now have a new interface but  I can't even upload products without getting an error..."
"I used the App of Rivo to help me grow up my subscribed customers! Opt in Pop up is very easy to use configure even for a guy like me (as I am 66yo). The interface is very simple to understand and the pop-up does what it it supposed to do like clockwork!
I am grateful for having this app for free as I have been paying dearly for similar apps.
On top of that of course is their amazing people in the support! Never had to wait more than two minutes to have someone like James to guide me and answer any questions I had!
Thank you Rivo and wishing you all the success in the world! Athan Apostolou

"This app makes life easy! The interface is very intuitive, and the final presentation to customers is very professional."
Super simple to set up. Easy to use. Awesome user experience and extremely happy thus far! NIPYATA! is a big fan of Refersion! #nipyatalove
"So far no complaints :-) Setup was super simple and the interface is logically laid out. Though this app might be priced a bit higher than some others, their longstanding position in the affiliate app space is something that you can count on, especially as your sales and affiliates grow."
"Super easy to use, and fantastic interface.  I'm still just getting started, but I'm sure I will be seeing the results in sales very soon."
"People just don't wanna hit that ""checkout"" button until they already know what the shipping will be worth.
This app is just what i needed to stop my abandoned cart issues.
So i tried it out on the 14 day trial, and it did just what the wrapper says it will do.
Staff are really responsive, i wanted to make a minor change of appearance which wasnt supported by the easy-to-use interface, so i emailed support for some intructions on how to edit the code, and before i had a chance to open up the editor and stick my nose in, staff had already made the changes i needed from thier end.
10/10 Me's recommend this app"

"After reviewing multiple affiliate program options, we elected to go with Refersion. Its depth of customization, interface, and tracking ability, are second to none. If you want the best affiliate suite there is, Refersion is the first and last stop. Don't even bother looking into any other options."
Great Shopify plugin. I'd recommend to any company looking to use affiliate marketing to grow their business and wants a rich interface that is simple to set up.
"Simple interface with tremendous impacts on up selling. Not just a one off app, their whole catalog is filled with professionally done apps."
Good app does what it says it would. Nice and clean interface. Keep up the good work!
"A superb experience. Easy, streamlined, non-complicated and the interface is clean and very, very tidy."
"SUGGESTION:  GET THIS APP ! While still in BETA for the lower price lock in rate this APP pays for itself.  
I would have no problem paying 2x or 3x the monthly rate Code Black Belt is currently offering this APP for.
First off - Big thanks to Mike over at Code Black Belt !
I have been waiting for a solution like the Shipping Rate Calculator Plus APP for awhile.  For any ecommerce site its crucial you provide a Grand Total immediately in Shopping Cart Summary.  Shoppers like full disclosure on totals $$$ and don't want to move on to the next page of checkout until they know..... Don't waste your time or theirs and give them the rates up front.  Sure Shopify may have a shipping rates estimator, but this is added work for the shopper on your site.  Whats great is that this APP does all the work for you.... It auto-displays the rates immediately based off GEO-LOCATION of shopper.
There is a number of reasons why this is important.
1.  This builds trust with new shoppers and the credibility of your site.
2.  Increases conversion rates to checkout

4.  Fast loading and Responsive.
I am always hesitant with Beta APPs but had to have this implemented immediately to see for myself.... Before I installed I contacted Code Black Belt to ask a couple questions and to test how quick their response time was.  Well they passed my ""Sniff Test"" with a quick reply and explained that their code will not affect other elements of theme as they use a single line of code that will not modify other elements.... Believe me I have had this happen in the past with other APPs so I am very careful always making backups of my theme.
Installation was seamless and displaying immediately !  I did notice afterwards the original Shipping Rates Estimator driven by Shopify was still displaying and saw a better way to layout the new APP to match our theme.
Contacted Code Black Belt and Mike over there always follows up with a solution and adjustments to layout which just makes our site combined with his APP look better and better.
I look at Code Black Belt Team and Mike as true professionals.... Unlike some other guys who write code and say ""Lets make an APP"" and then fall out of communication once they are on to the next thing.
Code Black Belt is a company to deal with because this is what they do.... Create Solutions that make your site better..... And when I say better I mean more sales and conversions.  Because their service is so phenomenal I am now looking at the next APP from Code Black Belt - Frequently Bought Together APP.
I look at business long term and need the right software APP partners to advance our ecommerce operations by enhancing elements on our shopping site.
We sell Garden Supplies and Horticulture Grow Equipment.  Offering thousands of products and Code Black Belt is now a part of our team to continue ""GROWING""

"Great! But some fuction should be more convience. The loyality pop up and the interface, I don't think when the buyer see it will log in my website, it should more beautiful and multiple."
Simple to set up - really nice interface - hoping it will bring lots of extra sales and revenue to the business http://www.rufflesnufflemats.com Thanks!
"We really love Refersion, and have recommended it to several other business owners we know who also use Shopify. We are definitely seeing extra sales coming in due to our affiliates now working for us to drive strong referrals. The user interface is great (for both us and for affiliates), and it also integrates well with Mailchimp. One of our favorite features is the ability to encourage affiliate signups right after order completion. Great app that is highly recommended!"
"So far so good - easy to set up and manage affiliates, clear and intuitive interface, does exactly what it says on the box."
This is a good app. Very simple and easy to use and navigate. Overall user experience is also satisfactory.
"Great product!  We have a lot of complementary products to our main products that weren't getting added to the Cart as often as we liked.
By adding Product Upsell, our customers can now easily buy print media and travel cases at the point of sale instead of after market.  
Product Upsell was easy to set up and the user experience is very good."
Great so far! We sell personalized in case of emergency ICE cards and tags and we were looking for a way to partner with different organizations in order to drive sales. Setup took about 5 minutes and the interface looks great on both my end and the affiliates end. Very professional.
Great product with a user-friendly interface. Alex is awesome - super quick replies and a problem solver.
"Your app is great, is currently the best solution for resizing and renaming pictures over Shopify. With a Clean interface is a great solution for all our catalogue of fibre optics products and accessories. The support has been excellent as well and the UI/UX experience is top notch. What is better is the PageSpeed improve that we had. Now we are on green numbers under PageSpeed Insights on Google.
Gets completely the job done!"
Easily provides email marketing campaigns in one interface. Very easy to use and setup takes minimal effort.
Thanks for incorporating my suggestions in the main stats interface. I ran programs for 15 years in another industry and I will say that this is a top-notch affiliate program built to work great with Shopify where others may not integrate as well. Great work.
"Service is excellent and the user interface is so easy to work with, two thumbs up."
"I like that they don't charge money until you start to have some success with the app. I don't like that the website and the interface look obsolete. I also don't like that I send a question via email and never got an answer. And finally, I don't like that they don't have multilingual support or at least a way for me to manually translate the subscription form for potential affiliates, as well as their dashboard for reports."
"I'm only a few days in but so far I am extremely impressed with Refersion. The interface is clean, fast and extremely easy to set up. It makes me cringe thinking about the past year I wasted with a larger affiliate tracking service. The Post Purchase option is money, can't wait to get this off and running!"
Refersion has a very easy to use and clean interface. Setup only took minutes. I would definitely recommend Refersion to anyone looking to add an affiliate program to their store.
Easy to set up. Easy to edit. Great client and affiliate interface. Thanks!
"The BEST affiliate program app for Shopify. Hands down.
Support is fast, friendly and efficient. 
The interface (backend and user experience) is intuitive and easy to navigate.
Setup, tracking and integrations (MailChimp, API, etc).
Whether you're new to affiliate programs or experienced with significant sales volume--this is the best app to test first."
Refersion is one of the best affiliate apps that i have used. The interface is clean and simple and better yet is the service when you need something. The owner Alex will get in touch with you within minutes of your service request and always available to take phone calls and help you out.
"Was looking for affordable, yet scalable solution for affiliate marketing. Refersion fits the bill. Clean interface, seamless integration with our Shopify store, and superb customer service. 
Would recommend to anyone."
"The easiest platform to setup and the most streamlined interface I have ever seen. Easily operate your entire referral program with just a few minutes of setup and the rest is point and click. We have grown our business 30x in a matter of months with this software. The only problem you will have will be, can you keep up with inventory demand?"
This is a awesome app. It is easy to setup. The user interface is easy to navigate and operate. The tracking is accurate. The affiliate also enjoy the easy signup process.
"Refersion is absolutely outstanding. From researching into the best application for an Affiliate Program, to purchase, and implementation, Alex has exercised outstanding and exemplary customer service. 
We came from an affiliate platform, which was extremely rudimentary in function, customization, and which had difficulty in accurate tracking. 
Refersion does everything you'd want and need in an Affiliate Platform.
Extremely Easy Implementation
User Friendly Interface & Navigation
Easy to Implement Affiliate Sign-Up Form
Tracking & Metrics for Affiliate Performance, Traffic and Conversions
Beautiful Automatic Email Notifications
Interactive Area for Creatives and Banners
Extremely simple to use Pay-Out System
Amazing Post-Purchase Customer Touch-Point Marketing - To Incentivize Brand Loyalty, Increase Sales, and Incentivize Repeat Purchases. 
Love the Refersion platform.. an couldn't possibly give a higher or better recommendation. Alex has done a remarkable job!"
This is a great app.  Easy to use with a great interface and the space squirrel team gave us prompt and great support.  Resulted in speed improvements across our website.  Would highly recommend.
"After dealing with Yahoo for over 13 and their limited ability to customize options to meet our needs it was refreshing, even down right great to be able to download an app which met my needs perfectly.  The interface is easy for those more challenged (like myself).  I can't say enough nice things about this app.  A good sound product like this has precipitated me to investigate more offers by this company which will further benefit my companies look and sales.
Thank you
Dave C.  New Jersey"
"Not for us. Interface and features are impressive, we just made our 2nd subscription payment, but serious use is not too practical. 
Not much margin on most suppliers, first two test orders gave us problems - one just disappeared between our cart and their order page so left us no way to fulfill except manually. Since the import process is already fairly manual to start, this was not good. 
Unless you're prepared to do your own repack and fulfillment, then most of the suppliers they support are not going to be much use. 
Rather than be totally negative, we do want to say that the app does what it says it does otherwise.  Just the lost order was just the last straw. Thanks anyway."
I got it to do exactly what I wanted in just minutes. It's a huge improvement to my storefront and user experience.
This app is very well done - it has easy interface and great customer support.  it helps to save lost sales on out of stock items.
"I used this app to add easy user interface to my website. The drop down menu is vital for a good web page, and Globo Mega Menu executes this concept super well. The customer support that comes alongside  this app is also outstanding, they're ready to help you whenever you need them, while also doing some niche customization for you when prompted to do so.
TL;DR, 10/10 app, really helps the user navigation on my website flow well."
The Globo Mega Menu app super user friendly user interface & great for developer customizations. Highly recommended!
"Great for helping organize stores with a large number of products.  Simple, clean interface that you quickly get used.  Top notch support if you ever get stuck on something."
"The app is really great in functions and user experience. Was having some unexpected bug on admin side, the support immediately looked into, and Emma from support fixed it before 12 hours from my first interaction. It was amazing customer support. The app is free and very useful for every single shopify store. Need to work on speed optimization a bit. The score in various speed optimization platforms, affects a bit because of this app. But the customer experience and functions for free is really amazing! Keep doing great work. So happy to write this review."
"I have been using Globo Mega Menu for over a year now as I have begun migrating several stores from an older platform to Shopify.  This is simply the best, most configurable and easiest to setup menu app available. 
The menus are sharp looking, easy to work with and very powerful. This kind of menu interface is the gold standard for E-commerce platforms.  
The customer support that comes along with this app has been second to none.  They've really gone out of their way, even doing custom CSS modifications for me to get the look exactly the way I wanted it.  They're fast, polite and they take customer service seriously."
user friendly interface with tons of options to help boost your store would recommend if you want to get more closings
Très pratique!! et gratuit !! l'interface est simple et facile è prendre en main pour les débutants !
"It's a brilliant designed tool, helps me keep my customers chatting with me while they are browsing through my store. 
I like the ease of installation and user friendly interface."
This is quite possibly the best mega menu app on the market right now. I tried several other and then settled on this one for its clean user interface and  easy administration.
"j'ai utilisé cette application pour m'aider à faire décoller mes ventes , l'interface est assez simple d'utilisation, je recommande."
"Probably the best mega menu app for Shopify. I nerded out for three days testing all the mega menu apps. There are a couple of nice features that make this menu app better then others; such as tabs within a mega menu.
But the absolute best feature, and I want to personally thank the developers for doing this, is the ability to insert any HTML you want into a column. The reason why this is helpful is that if you have very big menu lists, you can simply code them yourself way faster then using the interface.  You can also get creative and add anything you want into the mega menu such as videos, pictures, html5, basically anything. 
Thanks for the HTML feature guys. Really helpful!"
Amazing app and very user friendly interface. The features included are very useful and helps a lot in getting better results.
"Incredible service! The app itself is fantastic to use with an intuitive interface. And the Bold support team is one of the best I've ever dealt with. We needed a customisation to make our product order form work and they offered extra development free of charge - amazing! Don't hesitate, get his app!"
Amazing app and very user friendly interface. The features included are very useful and helps a lot in getting better results.
"The best affiliate program to be honest, staff is very active and you get problems fixed in No-Time ! It's a great way of learning and a great way of managing ! User interface is actually as friendly as it could be !"
"very easy to use at testing stage, clean interface. We shall see about how it works as we sign up more affiliates!"
Good help. Makes your shop faster. I like it and my customers too. The interface for using the app could be easier
Very easy interface!  We loved it very much. Anybody can do with little knowledge. Pricing plan is also very attractive.
Awesome interface and looks great with my shop theme! The staff is really helpful and helped me to set up the app very promptly. Thank you so much for your help :)
"THIS APP IS THE LIFE!!!! Beatiful interface,, very simple and so smart use. I love it. Thank to create"
"It is a simple interface and does what it is suppose to do.  Also, I have been in touch to get some assistance and it was a prompt reply.  Thank you."
"So helpful with our store and very user-friendly. The interface is clean and straightfoward, not clunky and ""ugly"" like the other ones you've seen. Their support staff is great as well. Quick to reply (within reasonable hours of course) and very helpful! It's crazy how much you get for free. I would definitely recommend this to anyone needing email marketing - even newbies! They lay everything out for you."
"Great first impression & really easy to use with simple interface. For what we needed, it fits the bill perfectly well."
"So far I've really enjoyed using this app, beautiful user interface design and great customer service. 
www.lacoess.com"
"I used the app the interface is very well designed! And the guidance links on each page helps explaining each page information is very good. Also the chat support team is very helpful & quick with solving the issues...
Thanks Emma & Matthew
Keep it up guys!
It would be great if all the fields shown for affiliate made dynamics so that we can show data as per programs..."
I used this app for affiliate programs and it works great. Really easy to use interface and overall great.
"I was looking for an email platform that helps me automate most of my email task, basically autopilot. I've been using mail chimp for years and wasn't completely happy with it. I was pleasantly surprised when I installed Omnisend to see how feature packed the platform is and how polished the user interface is. It took me no time to recreate a lot of the automations I had and I have new ideas to implement as well. The live view is a nice bonus and does a great job showing me in real time what's going on (things like what item was added to the cart). I had few questions during setup and the staff responded quickly and were super knowledgeable. Can't recommend it enough. I'm using the ""standard"" tier, the free is plenty good as well. Give it a try!"
This is a very useful app. Helped me set things up as well. Very professional with the user interface.
"I am using this app for my dropshipping business and I like it a lot. Great interface, great customer support. Recommend."
"easy and fast. I don't have time for anything else. quick service and intuitive user interface. 
Thank you"
"We love the compression of images. It allows our site to load much faster, giving our customers a better user experience."
Very Good App. Included Apps look clean and give several customizable options. User interface is easy to adopt. Customer support is very responsive and will diligently help you through issues. I recommend!
"Really smooth interface, easy to set up your marketing campaigns. I recommend this app!"
"Really smooth interface, quick and easy to set up your first marketing campaign. I recommend this app!"
"As a new business owner, I must say that the Vitals app has helped me integrate many useful features into my Shopify store. In addition to the enhancements to user experiences, marketing tools have also been thoughtfully crafted to help business owners promote and reach out to the audience effortlessly..."
"I love the connection between eBay and Shopify and I think the interface and way every thing connects is thought through really well. Once improved I think it will work excellently but it is currently freezing quite a bit and not loading pages under the ebay tab/ not publishing large amount of products. (This is probably just because I have a very large store for a basic account, but if Shopify and eBay can work on speeding  the connection up this will be 5* ...this is new and appreciated to you have my and I'm sure other Shopify users' patience."
"I have not used it yet, because I was asked to leave a review immediately after the initial settings. But the interface and detailed settings are very pleasing, everything is done very efficiently and conveniently. As you understand, I have not yet had time to use this application, but I promise that after using it fully, I will update this comment and share my experience in using the application."
"Nothing works like it should with this app. The categories do not upload correctly so I had to change every one manually. As well, my qty never sync properly with eBay. The interface is incredibly slow and I wait at times minutes on end for my listings to pop up. Trying to get someone to help is impossible. I have received orders through eBay but considering the number of hours I've spent trying to correct listings, I'm not sure that it's worth my while. 
****UPDATE:
The support team has reached out to me but NOTHING has changed. Qtys between shopify and ebay don't match, it can literally take me over 1 minute to be able to open a listing on this app as it is incredibly slow and I don't want to mention the number of error messages I get along the way. I realize this is a free app but am I am the only one with these problems? What are the 200+ 5 star reviewers doing that I'm not doing?
2nd UPDATE
someone mentioned that the 236 Five Star reviews were probably fake. I must agree. I cannot believe that the largest company in Canada - Shopify - would not have vetted this app before allowing it on their site."
First time using a email marketing app and it was super easy to use. Simple interface and has option to segment your audience. Still waiting to see the results but seems pretty legit so far.
"I was getting frustrated with my other campaign platform and its lack of integration with Shopify, so I decided to research a couple of others to find a better fit. In doing so, I came across Omnisend and of the three I checked out - so far so good! I love the neat little scratch-off features and the gift box, and find it's a useful tool in my email marketing! I do wish there were more CSS gifs available and more ""movement"" options in the templates outside of having a load of coding knowledge. For a small business that wants a big imprint - its just not always ideal to spend gobs of time on email campaigns. 
Overall - for just starting out with Omnisend - I can't complain. The cost isn't absurd and the features are abundant! I love the user interface, the seamless Mailchimp integration, and the overall ease of use. The campaign templates aren't that bad either! The worst part is coming up with content! LOL!! Give them a try - I doubt you'll be displeased! :)"
"This app has high level tools and AMAZING value for money. It would cost over $200 to buy all of the different tools Vitals offers, as separate apps. Great support and smooth interface. I keep discovering new stuff within their app. Thank you!"
"ebay integration is good, it brings all my ebay into shopify. However it is vary slow when it comes to publishing an item. Ebay can improve by pre-checking items that can be approved or not approved so that publishing is faster like implementing a check that the product is good to be approved. I can see that there is 'ready to be published' list of products however that list does not actually check if product violates policy or is not allowed etc. When it goes for publishing it takes forever. Also what I see is not available is - according to ebay account what number of items are allowed and can be published should be a list and check already available rather than at publishing time. Then it gives a bad user experience when seller goes to publish few items from shopify, it takes few minutes and comes back saying you are only allowed £650 worth of products to be published this month. Over all the experience is good, but very very slow. Ontime publishing checks and experience need to be improved."
"The app is simple and works better than the Facebook app, for example. Better than that, only if Ebay could improve their interface."
"Such a really nice app and easy to use. The user experience is really nice.
One improvment could to choose to add or not a logo. It looks like mandatory for now. So when the colors are not matching, not all the type of video can be used"
"UPDATE: this plugin gets worst by the minute. Have had it confirmed that it ignores inventory and visibility settings which results in products we don’t want listed being sent to eBay and eBay telling us we are breaching their policies yet it is there app that is causing the breaches. Support staff from the app developers and eBay is hopeless. Shopify please setup Amazon as eBay is a joke!
The app does not support Safari, therefore it is totally useless for our business. They really need to mention what browsers they support etc.. Further to this, when you do get it to work via Chrome, the interface doesn't sync correctly. When you contact your eBay account manager they just flob you off and try and state that their app is flawless. It is total rubbish and not worth the hassle of continuous disputes because stock/inventory for locations doesn't sync correctly, or because refunds issued via Shopify arent correctly processed or accepted by eBay. This app should be removed from the app store until it actually functions."
The interface and pretty and userfriendly. Many functions that I need some time to study these. It's a very good apps.
"I would stay far away from this app.  They have no incentive to support it, and support is abysmal.  I tried and tried to work with them on it, and its always finger pointing back to either eBay to Shopify.  I really wanted this app to work.  
Issues:  Constant price discrepancies between eBay and Shopify.  Items get out of sync, and they will not sync again unless each eBay listing is touched to manually sync.  Impossible when you run around 1k listings.  I would change a price on Shopify and the price simply does not change on eBay.  This is especially important to my store because I sell a lot of precious metals.
When you are trying to pull in eBay catalog data, the interface only works about half the time, and either errors or spins the other half.
There are other issues but right now I have to find another solution to get my stuff fixed."
Easy to use interface! Lots of templates that can help easily create your mailers. Looks professional. Highly recommended.
"Very buggy. I currently have an 85% on time tracking level on my EBay account because of the failures to upload tracking data from Shopify through the EBay APl, hopefully it doesn't fall below standard because of additional EBay API failures. I have never been late shipping but the interface just doesn't work sometimes. I give it two stars because it kind of functions but it's rudimentary and it's really a Beta version.
The developers of the app are not really engaged with the product, you kind of get the run around when you contact Shopify or the EBay developers. Emails from the EBay channel developers go unanswered. If this is your livelihood I would probably stay away from this online commerce model, like I said it's really buggy with not a lot of support."
"The user interface and the process of adding items to eBay are a bit clunky and not very intuitive. The biggest issue we're facing at the moment is that it's not possible to bulk edit the item condition; the condition is always ""new"", but we'd like our default to be ""seller refurbished"". We list hundreds of items a week, and it's impossible to change each item one-by-one. Hopefully this functionality will be available soon."
"A really good app for email marketing, helped me get started with email marketing. The User interface is really good! https://www.assamicaagro.in"
"We just used Omnisend to send out our first email newsletter. User experience was awesome, very easy to use and customize to our needs.
Thank you for a great app @omnisend

"Does alright for leads, but WILL EAT YOUR BOTTOM LINE WITH FEES!!! Word to the wise, choose your list items carefully! Also, the help section isnt very helpful. After trying to be upfront with purchasers about a lengthy delivery time in order to try to save on shipping to compensate for the fees, so I can stay competitive, I haven't been able to sell without seriously risking my business's reputation. Would suggest making the user interface easier."
Great user interface! Very simple to use. Highly recommend getting started with them for your affiliate program
"This is got to be probably the world's most limited CRM software I have ever seen.
First, they do not have embedded forms, only pop ups and landing pages. 
Second, you need to use an app called privy to create an embedded form.
Third, privy sends your contacts to a list, BUT SINCE THEY DECIDED TO FREAKING REMOVE "" LISTS"" , YOU CANNOT EVEN CREATE A CUSTOM LIST ANYMORE FOR YOUR CONTACTS! 
4TH, they charge exactly like klaviyo for what? what functionality do you guys have that klaviyo does not have?
To summarize, they have a good interface design, and THAT IS ALL.
I wish I had never made the move from klaviyo to here, its worth sucking up the horrible design interface on klaviyo but at least enjoy all the functionality they have.
The limits on this app are embarrassing."
great app! good interface and help you out as a beginner highly recommend it for those who are just starting out
"We're still figuring things out, but so far so good! The interface is similar to MailChimp so the transition has been seamless thus far."
"This app is amazing compared to other ones, such as Instafeed. The interface is super clean and it gives you a ton of customization. The chat support is also really helpful! Definitely recommend it!"
"I created a video, and when I tried to delete it, I found that there would still be a thumbnail image in the product interface after the video was deleted, which caused me a lot of trouble"
"The customer service has been really helpful and the app itself is very easy to use. The interface, design, and overall experience has been great."
I just started using this app and so far it's been great! Pretty easy to create campaigns and automations. Interface is easy to use and they suggest helpful tips on email/website strategies. Really liking it so far!
"Absolutely amazing application. Great Automation, Campaigns, Forms and Prompt Customer Support. The problem is with Shopify however where I'm unable to disable shipping confirmation so the customer gets 2 mails instead of one. Omnisend offers an amazing all in one email marketing and forms solution from exit intent, standard to wheel of fortune popups. Automatic generated discounts from within omnisend as well. Pricing is extremely competitive and ten times better than klaviyo. Definitely purchasing their plan and I recommend others to try the 14 day free trial and use it. You'll end up buying it. Because it combines all the features of 10/20 apps on shopify in an intuitive interface for 16.99 / month."
"For a free app, it out delivers big time! Extremely easy set up, dashboard interface is very user friendly. Offers a fair bit of customization options (would like to see the option of changing font type). Great app that looks really good on your page."
I have only just started using this app and already I am so impressed! Not only is the interface so easy to use but the tutorials and help centre make the entire experience a dream. The team is quick to respond and have managed to solve my every request.
"I used this app to help me do email, I really like it. The interface is very clean and tidy, easy to operate, and the template is exquisite. Five stars!"
"Just upgraded to growth plan and believe that it is a solid app; however, I think there is some work to be done on the User Interface and design for affiliates and brands alike.  Not the easiest to navigate and logically understand at first, but once you get used to it, it clicks. Once they get those worked out, should be a five star experience."
"This app helped me send campaigns and promotions to my subscribers. Unlike other apps, this app does the whole work for you and very easy interface to setup. I only had a little problem receiving the email for verification and the support was quick to act. Now, i'm meeting up my subscribers at the point of their needs to boost sale. Thank team. Good work. Highly recommended."
"Had some issues with creating duplicate accounts when trying to connect to shopify, but it was totally my fault. I chatted with them and they were super responsive and solved my problem quickly. Their user interface is really easy and newsletters and emails can be created quickly. I would definitely suggest using this app."
"Great for email campaigns! Really easy to use interface that gets the job done quickly. Haven't used all the features yet, but excited to keep trying them out."
the interface is very easy and i really enjoy the easy tutorials. Keep it up Secomapp. i just hope you can open some important features
Amazing customer service. Super helpful and patient. Clean interface and cute illustrations. Thank you!
"The email editor is great and has enough power to make really nice looking and engaging emails. The analytics are good and the interface is easy to navigate, The little bit of customer support I have needed has been very responsive and helpful."
"easy to use, great user interface, mighty functions, smart work flow! PS. they answer your question almost immediately! really good."
"Omnisend has a really beautiful interface, and the emails are looking great! There are some workarounds I have to do with automation, as the platform isn't fully on the same level as Mail Chimp, but all around, a pretty good service for a good price."
"June 1, 2019
It is time to update the review .
As I mentioned before, the apps become more useful. But once again, new bugs make the app pretty dangerous to use.  The latest bug (although I am pretty sure I've seen it in earlier versions) makes the app to change your product barcode and replace it with eBay custom label (SKU).  It is a pretty dangerous bug because barcodes are quite important . They are used by Goggle Shopping and once barcode is invalid the goods are no longer appear in the google shopping feed. So be prepare to lose all your Goggle shopping feed 
July 16
Good news: I am please to report that some of the bugs pointed in the original review were fixed!  Also, several new futures were introduced that make the app a bit more useful for eBay sellers with store subscription. I was ready to upgrade the review star rating when I ran into - 
Bad news: with the new futures comes new bugs. They are pretty major and can jeopardize your eBay seller performance if you are not careful.
Also, you still suppose to edit Ebay policies in Shopify App and not in Ebay.  But still, not all the policy options are present through Shopify interface, so if you follow the instructions you would screw up the Ebay policies which would screw your Ebay listings. Hopefully, this would be fixed in another 3 month
Apr 19
Don't expect much from it. The product is full of bugs.  You might be able to publish a listing on Ebay, but then you will have to open it in Ebay and fix it (at least fix package type, fix upc code and fix sku ).  If you don't fix the package type people won't be able to buy it.
If you create listing with variations, be prepare to also fix the pictures.
That's just some of the bugs.  There are also documented ""limitations"". For example, you suppose to edit Ebay policies in Shopify, not in Ebay.  But not all the options are present, so if you follow the instructions you will screw the policies which would screw your listings.
The support is kind of sort of there but don't expect much either. It takes a lot of efforts to get the message across. But even they accept the fact that there is bug or two in the product, it could take a long time to get a fix
Jan 20, 2020
I finally gave up on this application and remove it from my store.  
Just to summarize, this is what application DOES and DOES NOT:
- it does create a new Ebay listing or link existing listing with Shopify. Once it happens, you can't make ANY changes to the listing directly but only through the application. However, since application does NOT support fixed price with ""best offer"" and also requires immediate payment - it would severely limit your Ebay listing performance.  Once again - the minute the application takes over your listings the only way back is to delete/end the listing (and loose all sales and questions history) and create a new listing.
Also, as a ""bonus"", once in a while the application will overwrite Shopify ""Barcode (ISBN, UPC, GTIN, etc.)"" field with Ebay MPN/SKU value.  This will screw up your google/bing shopping feed as they require valud UPC"
"I highly recommend it. The application helped us a lot in our first email marketing campaign, for beginners it is very easy to use, it has a lot of functionalities for the design of the content and the best thing is that the user experience is impressive, we are very happy of how easy it was to have our first email marketing campaign for our online store."
"Let me just cancel out all the negative comments on this app by saying that this has completely turned my store around. I've sold 291 items with over $3200 in sales since it launched in November. Prior to this I was paying for advertising on a limited budget and wasn't making a lot of sales directly from my online store. The interface is simple. I learned a lot from a couple of mistakes but customer support was always there for me when I had a question. It's literally running on it's own now....5-6 sales a day...in my sleep.
So I'm done trying it out. I KNOW IT WORKS! My next step is making it a true EBAY STORE (1st 3 months free with SHOPIFY) and take it to the next level. JUST WATCH THIS SPACE!"
"We just moved over from Shopify, export of current lists was seamless, user interface was great and very simple to follow
definitely recommended
A nice feature addition would be to edit images size within the app"
"So, I am a switchover from the MailChimp trauma... and I've always disliked the clunky MailChimp interface... but OmniSend has not only made the transition easy (and I had custom forms and everything) but their interface is awesome. Everything is visual, easy to follow, and allows me to focus on content rather than trying to do what I want with a bad interface like MailChimp. The support is quick, and super friendly to - it does make a difference. Thanks so much Omnisend for making a potentially painful process easy!"
"Very easy first time experience, free trial is great, highly customizable interface. I would recommend it overall!"
"An excellent and very convenient application! What I liked: 1. Everything is collected in one interface.
2. Flexible settings.
3. It practically does not affect the loading speed of the site.
4. Price! Only $ 30 for all the necessary plugins. And most importantly, it is excellent technical support! They respond very quickly and help you set up applications. They even helped me add CSS to my template. Very cool guys! I recommend it!"
"Hello World.  
I did have some minor issues. Sheryl at eBay support was able to help me.  Just send Tech Support an email.  They are pretty fast on responding.  I would say within 5 minutes they replied to each of my issues.  
I also could not sync but they showed me how to refresh all my items.  After that, I was able to publish quickly and make the order.  Here are some things I have learned so far.
BULK EDITING
eBay app has a bulk editing interface but I did not see it force the changes over to Shopify when I made changes to my titles.  Shopify also has a bulk editing interface.  You can also use Shopify CSV to make quick changes to thousands of items in an excel spreadsheet then upload it back up.
TECH SUPPORT
I see a lot of reviews but very little talk about contacting tech support.  So far tech support has been key to helping me with most of my issues.
SALES TAX
eBay app does not yet have this feature among some others.  You can update this via the eBay listing.  The developers do not recommend updating anything else.  If your listing unsyncs you can try Force Sync directly with your product from the eBay app.
EDITING via eBAY LISTING
I was told that updating an eBay listing from eBay is not recommend or it might unsync with Shopify.  That being said some things are necessary such as sales tax.  If you get unsynced you can try Force Sync which is located on the eBay app under Listing on the product page.  Contact tech support for further help
ADDING PICTURES AFTER IT's BEEN LISTED
I tried adding pictures after my product was listed.  It didn't show up and if you add pictures from eBay it might remove your other images.  Tech support gave me a workaround until they get this fixed.  You will need to unpublish and remove your listing from the eBay app.  Open publish and Import New.  Then publish your product again so all your pictures will show.
CHANGING CATEGORIES
Is working! =)
hope this helps."
"I've been really impressed with this affiliate app. Beautiful interface, clean tracking, and they're adding features all the time. Keep up the great work!"
This app had many good functions with a easy user interface. Customer Service was fast to respond and kind.
"After doing a bunch of research and trying several services. We recently switched our newsletter service to Omnisend. I have to say, I was bummed to leave mailchimp, but I'm now kind of obsessed (haha) with omnisend. Their interface is clean and intuitive and makes it super easy to implement the basic things we needed to have in place. So far I'm loving it + 100% recommend."
"So far it's been great! Easy to use, helpful set up emails. Look forward to getting into this interface and optimizing it's options!"
"A comprehensive Affiliate Program for Shopify owner, support is fast and superb! Clean and clear user interface, highly recommended! Good Job!"
"Good app, this app is free but good quality and good interface, better than not free app. I recommand this app"
"I really loved the app...speacially the easy going interface.
I just started using the app so will try to give a detailed review after using it more.
Glad i found you guys"
This definitely help in order to have my own affiliate program. Easy to use and user-friendly interface/dashboard. Plus it's free!
I was lucky to have the lifetime free of this app and I highly recommended it! Very easy to use and straight to the point with great User Experience!
"Great app, does the job perfectly!!! I highly recommend this app, the user interface is very friendly and smooth!"
"First, the app is excellent. It has an intuitive user interface. It has plenty of ways to configure the user's experience as well as its behavior. Second, the tech support is outstanding. They always seem to be there when I need them and they are very knowledgeable. I've had dealings with 4 other app developers and this company, by far, is the best."
"As a real lay person to IT the user interface I prefer to other competitors as it is very clear and straightforward!
Have just had my first experience with the customer service team and they were prompt in their response and directed me to the solution necessary. 5 star! Would recommend."
"I specifically needed swatches for collection pages. After reading through all the swatch apps, I narrowed my search to three that I installed and tested. No app worked right out of the box for my specific needs, however, this won in the end. I'm picky about my site's UX and aesthetics, and between the app's interface and the StarApps team doing a small amount of further customization for me, I got the exact look and functionality I wanted within 48 hours. Their communication was clear and timely. They've been truly wonderful to work with."
"I don't know where all the good reviews are coming from. Definitely not from people who have used this app. It's totally buggy, the interface doesn't make any sense, it seems impossible to delete pop ups. I accidentally created 5 pop ups, all messing up with my page performance. As a customer on my site it was hard to click on the X and close the pop up. I deleted the app after a few days but now my site has a huge gap left from some code that the app left. And I have to solve this myself now. Super annoyed. And it's not really free either."
"Very grateful and delighted with the functionalities of this application. Excellent interface, design and it is super fast, it does not slow down your website. The support is too fast and efficient, I made a request and within a few hours it was resolved and well executed. Excellent work! Highly recommended!"
Great Program...Top of the Line interface.
"Made a discount code banner - worked perfectly!!  Very intuitive interface, and great options even in the free version."
I used this app to emphasize the message I wanted to give to the visitors. It was really easy to set up with a good interface.  I would recommend this app to others because even though it's a free version it satisfies most of your needs.
Still new to the app but so far the user interface on both the back and front end is great. I had some initial questions regarding discount codes and somewhat got back to me within 5 minutes of submitting my question. I was really impressed and am looking forward to using this app more.
"One of the highest quality apps I have ever used on Shopify. It has immense flexibility (more so than any paid versions I have seen), and a really polished user interface. It is truly astonishing that it is free. I have built dozens of Shopify stores and would recommend to anyone from a developer to a novice."
Five star service. Great Product. Great Interface. Definitely recommend Appstle to anyone wanting to give a subscription model a go.
"Superb step by step workflow to easily cerate your label and the logic that come with. Plenty of easy to understand options. I was looking for an app with which I can create my labels instead of using the ones that are usually provided (not always really beautiful and mostly in English). With this app, you can create your own text label and customise size font, background size and colour, position etc. Everything from one place. I also uploaded my own image (Made in France) in one click and adjust the size and position directly from he interface. The bets part : you can use the app with two labels for free (which I did) and I am know deploying this app on all my websites, and will switch to the very affordable plan to start playing with the rules for my websites that need more advanced settings. That being said, if you just need 2 labels, you can use this app for free and relax knowing that if you need more, no need to change app : everything is here. Good job guys !"
"We love this app! its amazing when how do you order all the information.
this app is important to improve the user experience"
"This app is a great way for your customers to gain trust before purchasing. I enjoy this app's interface, brand, and customer service. Highly recommend."
"The customer support at Rivyo is phenomenal! The support team has solved all of our issues from importing reviews to making cosmetic adjustments on our live theme and the wait time is virtually none. We have just installed the app this week and it's definitely a worthy purchase. As for the app itself, its user interface is very friendly and it has all the features we need."
"This app is a life saver. Put together forms easily, logically. Super user-friendly and thorough interface."
Great app with great reactive support when you have a problem I recommand this app happy to use it The interface is also very clear
"It's free but you're able to do enough without paying for the premium, it's easy to use & very neat interface."
"Easy to use, I love it as it was a quick setup with good customizable options and easy interface. Recommend it!"
The interface is intuitive and does what it needs to seamlessly. Support has been FAB has been speedy and prompt.
"Amazing customer service! They helped me add the stars under the products! Very user-friendly interface and the ""Powered by Rivyo"" note was not very notable, compared to other apps."
"I used this app to add a few forms to my website.  Very easy to use and makes a difference in the appearance and user experience.  Linda Singh, Founder of Sitara Collections 1-17-19"
"As far as build experience goes, it's a breeze to use. I will update this review as we receive submissions and user experience gets back to us."
"I tried many different subscription apps on Shopify and this one is really the best one! it‘s affordable, has excellent customer support and easy to use interface! definitely recommend it."
"I would absolutely recommend this app. The support team replies so quickly and is ready to help anytime LIVE. No support tickets, no wait. The app is so easy to use and offers exactly what it promises. Do not hesitate to give it a try. Thank you so much Appstle for this great user experience."
Works! No complaints here. It was simple and easy to use. I do like the user interface and feel the pricing was fair.
Excellent customer service! They helped me work through every problem I had over their chat function. Fair pricing! Easy-to-use interface! I would highly recommend this app to all.
I find the interface generally quite simple to use and easy to understand. The staff are also very responsive and helpful - very good customer service! Please keep this up. I would make minor changes like if the subscription price changes it should flow through everything the user sees. Having the old information visible is quite confusing.
"It is very useful for my e-commerce store, very user friendly interface, and I wish it can improve more features in future"
Easy to create the form. Interface is very easy to use. Fast integration with shopify. I was able to create a simple contact form in 5 minutes!
"""I love this app. There have been a few SEO apps I have used and for me they seemed harder to figure out than this one. The interface is pleasant and set up is easy. Also it integrates with my review system Yotpo. Lastly, Rado has been a great help explaining how to properly implement structured data. He actually reached out to me because he noticed there were some errors on my website. Through his diagnosis, he led me to what I needed to do while he worked on his end to fix the issues. I feel confident in his recommendation. I also feel I gained a partner when it comes to keeping my website up and running and easy to index for Google. Please check out this app and get in contact with Rado. He will surely take care of you and you will love this app.
Update on 9/12: I spoke the team about how to improve my page speed and they pointed out a few things to fix. In a few days, I saw that one of my pages had an error in Google Search Console. Rado and his team were able to fix it. They are always so helpful."
"For a free app, this has a great interface, is easy to use, and offers great options for customization."
"I've been using this app for 5 days and i am seeing some improvements in my SEO already. Also the interface is clean and easy to use, so i will probably keep the app!"
"This app is the best! For the pricing, the interface, the easy to use, the customer service! If you need a good SEO on your website, this is what you need! Highly recommended!"
"Amazing customer support and service. The developer support was incredible and efficient and allowed me to get started quickly. Interface is polished and beautiful, and allows me to serve my customers well."
"Fantastic and comprehensive SEO app, very happy and satisfied with it.. I first saw it and thought it can't be that good as it's the cheapest of all SEO app, so I tried 3 or 4 other SEO apps within a day and though to give SMART SEO a shot and it turned out to include most, if not all, features of the other apps, and most importantly very easy to use as everything is presented for you in a simple manner and explained within its interface without going to the help section or contacting support.. but if you contact support you'll almost always get a very helpful response within hours. Thank you for your hard work and superior efforts, highly appreciated! :)"
"This is a very good app, hope you will use it too. Customizable interface, Get video ,picture review"
"Just started the free trial using this app and I must say I am impressed. The Install was easy and the interface is painless! Although I am no stranger to SEO this app makes implementing certain SEO strategies simple. Naturally it will take a little time to see if these improvements show up in Google Webmasters, however I have a good feeling it will be quicker than expected. I highly recommend this app."
"I have been wanting to add a lead page to my site and Form Builder made it very easy to do so.  Simple intuitive interface, hoping to grow my list as a result!"
"Great SEO app!!! Simple interface, very effective and robust with the essential tools you need. The JSON data is great also! Customer service is excellent!"
"I've been using the app for 5 days, it has been great. The interface is very user friendly and easy to use, so would recommend. Also, their support is fantastic and very helpful."
We used SmartSEO app for our new ecommerce website. SmartSEO was simple to use and makes it easy for people who are new to SEO game with good interface. Getting an SEO Score on your product and collection pages with appropriate guidance makes it easy for the website owners. Great app and absolutely recommend to people who are new to SEO. Even if you are not new I believe this app gives a simple interface makes it a must have for everyone. Thanks SmartSEO
"So far, so good. The interface is probably my favourite of any Shopify app. Writing and tweaking seo is a chore for me but this app makes it easier. Much better than my spreadsheets and faster because I am motivated to see the scores hit 100. I DO wish that it could give me a score that takes all of the many elements into account all at once, but then that would probably be a significantly more expensive app. I had a couple questions at first and support was very responsive and helpful."
"Great app, easy, fast and good admin interface!"
"i migrated from their competitor Y...O today. the onboarding was smooth, the installation was automated, and when it could automate certain parts, their staf connected on their own initiative and implemented it.
the user interface is great and simple, and the import reviews from Y...O was straightforward. I upgraded right away.
I am yet to analyze performance impact of the widget, but I don't think it will be as slow to load as Y...O one."
Easy to use online interface and great pricing. Very helpful and responsive customer service. Thanks!
"After digging around, install everything with the staff and realized that ""STRIPE"" was not working I decide to move to the competition... What i saw was ugly, first, the Appstle competition charges You a LOT... There interface is bad and no CS... I proudly come back to Appstle and realized how good they are. I believe they will become leaders very soon. I Totaly recommend you to use this app. Everything looks good, everything is simple and well explain, and the Customers service work 24/24. So it's the best so far. Keep doing guys!"
"The new interface is a big improvement over the old one as it allows now to make individual edits to things that the templates you have made in the bulk edit function needs a little tweaking. Very time saving and appears to work well. I had a couple little issues with it, but support responded timely and resolved them. Better than other SEO apps I have tested in the past here."
"PROS: 
1. The guys that write the app are great. They will promptly and timely answer to your questions. Keep going with a good job!
2. The main thing that distinguishes this app from all other similar apps is that this app is written logically, intuitively, and with lots of thought. 
3. The interface is very easy to work with, hats down, you won't need to read the FAQ or watch videos. You'll jump right in and start customizing.
4. You can do all the customizations in one app - text, long text color & image swatches, instruction/information bars, grid, buttons, checkboxes, radio boxes, file upload, dropdown. I found only 1 other Shopify app that can do all of the above.
5. You can use HTML code in the instruction fields which makes your page unique and gives tones of possibilities to decorate it in colors, images, font sizes, paragraphs, etc. For those like me who don't understand HTML - there are free automated web sites that would code the HTML. Just search for ""word to HTML"" on google.
6. This app has the most simple and elegant design on the outside. Simple, clean lines and shapes of the fields and swatches, that would interfere and match any website design.
7. Price is great and compared to other apps and their possibilities, this one wins over anything else.
CONS:
1. The app does not interact with AJAX pop up cart. The developers said they are thinking to write their own AJAX pop up cart and I hope they do it soon. This is really important.
2. The price add on didn't work for my theme (bought outside Shopify), however, they fixed it, but, the price add on now appears in the shopping cart as a completely individual product without a photo. Very weird.
I wish I was able to at least attach a  photo for this new ""product"" so the customers don't feel as weird as I felt when I saw it."
"They are awseome!I had a problem with my interface, the color of the widget review was black and the background was black too, that's why the words could not be seen, but they fixed it in a few minutes. I recommand this app for everyone!!"
I used this app to create a subscription plan for the products on my website. It was really handy and the free plan is perfectly suited to small businesses. The user interface is really good and I was able to chat with someone as I created the subscriptions. Great app!
"Absolutely 5 Stars!!! Customer service is amazing. Had an issue with images on the Focal theme, but Jon and Martin resolved the issue in less than 14 hours. Commendable!
Very clean interface -- easy to use and the swatches look great!"
"Great functionality, very easy interface. Customer service answers within minutes. Would definitely recommend!"
"It's great - it does what it says it does and interface in both laptop and mobile is fantastic and elegant. Quick backoffice service from developers, too. Biggest downside for me is that I have to sacrifice the ability to submit discount codes as this app takes over the discount box. 
Edit - the work around for this issue and make the app compatible with adding and allowing discounts in the cart page is adding an app called KartDiscount (https://apps.shopify.com/discount-coupon-field-in-cart-page/?bcpolink)"
"Easy to use app with a simple interface. Great customer service, fast and attentive communication from support by Hussain."
"This app works very well - the interface is simple and intuitive, and the support I received was excellent."
"I was looking for an app that had a simple interface when it came to adding custom swatches.I  Found this beauty of an app and it works great. 
I had a problem with the app and my theme and they got back to me within 24hrs well 4hrs lol .
Looking forward to the updates for this app. If you could track the quantities for the swatches, then that would be a game changer."
"In short, the app is one of the best in its kind. We tried a few of different apps for product options with a price addon feature and none of them matched our requirements. Some of them were slow to load. The others required some extensive integration before to use with cluttered interface. After installing the app we were able to use it straight away. The app has a minimalist interface, exactly what we wanted. I wish the app would have a product search by any keyword from a product name, and not its full name. Of course, you can also search by a vendor or collection name. When we needed some help the guys were very responsive. They did everything we asked them to do, and did it quickly. We highly recommend to use the app for product options as it has a lot of features you might ever need to sale your products more successfully."
"I used this app to setup a very complex product for our shop. I had researched a number of Custom Product Option apps and tested them and they all failed in terms of the user experience on the front end. When I found this app and tested it, not only was the customer support amazing and responsive - it worked for my needs. 
I highly recommend this app. Its easy to use and straight forward."
"We stuck with this app despite having a rough start because for us it took longer to grasp the nuances of the interface particularly the Alt Tag for images but we got it going. Recently we reached out to them about CEO configurations and they graciously helped us fix a redundancy from a different app we had not used in years that left code there. In our 6+ years of Shopify apps we have never encountered folks so helpful and on their game. The wheelhouse of SEO is ever changing and our company does not have the time to delve into that wheel house. We have updated this review to reflect the fast and thorough help we've gotten from them. Thanks Sherpa, stay golden!"
I was searching for a form building app for my company for a while. Thank god I found this one. They do a great job of making the interface easy for users to navigate and create. I absolutely recommend this to anyone who needs a form for anything on their website.
"Exceptional Customer support. Extremely easy to use User Interface. I have ADHD and have had trouble setting up complex menu options with other apps. The workflow of creating options with  (If-Then) variables with ""Best Product Options"" made things so much easier and stress less for me. Ive since deleted my previous options app and made the complete switch to This app. Feel free to checkout my websites and see the options in action - windowtintsupplies.com :)"
"Why you need this app?
1)Simple and easy interface
2)Best price
3)Customer support is awesome. 
And what more?
Highly recommended app!!"
"Great app able to do lots of functions that the other ones on the market could not, like using your Shopify variants as conditional selections for example. Simple clean, easy to use interface and the app does not slow down the Shopify webpages when they load. Support is also stellar, raised a case over the weekend and they came back to me with a solution in double quick time.
I would not hesitate recommending this app if you are looking to customise your product options."
The user experience of Appstle is better than any subscription app on the market. When I had questions on how to customize the app to our stores liking their team was quick to reply and helpful to resolve any issues.
"Amazing support, very responsive and helpful.
Easy to understand interface; beginner friendly which helped us a lot during setup. 
Can't wait for future updates!"
Creating forms with Form Builder is about as easy as can be. Intuitive interface guides you every step of the way. Great app!
Smart SEO is very easy to set-up and brings a lot of features to the table. Nice and clean interface.
"Fast responses from team, awesome help, walked me through each step and sent a link to ensure I have a great future reference. The interface is very nice as well. Took me less than 5 minutes to connect my subscriptions to my store products. Not to mention, their free plan has almost everything you need to get subscriptions going. Would highly recommend to anyone."
"Every time I reach out to the team for help, both before and after purchase, I've had a great experience. The interface is easy to use, the service is great, and we couldn't be happier! I tracked this app for weeks before installing it and saw it grow from less than 50 to 200+ reviews. I am not surprised, highly recommend it."
Great App! It helps in increasing the conversion rate by providing a splendid user experience. Very good support. Keep up guys.
I used this app to help me display more product options / variants. It has a fantastic customer facing interface and worked very well.
"This was easy to install, and didn't interfere with payment/financing apps already installed.  It made a big difference in the user experience almost instantly!"
"This app is easy to use and greatly streamlines the process of managing our small farms veggie box subscription program. Our customers have expressed that it is easy and user-friendly to interface with and I am very satisfied with the customisation, tools and information that it gives me on the back end. The customer service staff are very helpful and friendly, the payment and fees for the app are also very generous and fair. I would very much recommend this app"
Great customer service and user-friendly interface. Highly recommend to all e-commerce stores out there!
"Amazing support, easy to use and great interface! I had problems with coding left over form another subscription app I tested. Within about 10 minutes of contacting Appstle Support they had fixed the issues that the other app left on my site. The team have done a great job in creating this app and have obviously done their market research and know what us consumers wanted!"
Easy to use and very fast interface this app work very well I recommend it
It's really simple to set up and the user interface in the product page is really clean and professional looking. I had some issues setting it up to the way I wanted for my store because I'm using a custom theme and the support was really helpful and I got the issues resolved! Thumbs UP! I recommend.
"This app was awesome! We've been looking for a subscription app for a while but since we sell seasonally, the monthly pricing structure didn't work for us. This app was super easy to set up and the pricing scales with the number of subscriptions. The support was fabulous and the interface was really user friendly."
"I RECOMMEND IT! I tested several applications before this one, but this is by far the most interesting. The interface is professional and intuitive. The customer support is very dynamic. I adjusted all my settings in less than 5 minutes."
love the interface! super clean and easy to navigate :) Hope there's a workaround for automatic charging for stores without shopify payments soon!
"Their suite of apps have been a true blessing to someone like me who is used to working with WordPress and plugins. My client gets his contact form, his social feeds, and his popup banners effortlessly and under one roof. The redesign of the interface has been phenomenal as well. Great Job!"
"Really useful, and simple to use. Besides, the interface is really nice~I would recommend the app to others!"
"I would rate everything about this company, app, experience with a 5.0.
A quick summary:
- the app does what we need, it's responsive, it has a clean interface for our customers to check shipping status.  it's easily configurable (css, etc), and it is RELIABLE
- the company is great too.  good business model that has allowed us to grow from a small ecommerce company to a bit bigger with no friction.  
- customer support is phenomenal.  we've talked with them maybe 5-6 times and not only are they always extremely friendly, but just knowledgeable - that's not always the case with small companies.  but they are able to solve our problems each time with ease.
definitely the best tracking app
-d"
"This app is pretty incredible.  It helped us meet an aggressive timeline for migrating to Shopify including moving over a HUGE amount of metafield information.  We would have spent many more hours (if not days) trying to get product/collection records sorted out and imported correctly without this app.
This is the only app I've found that will let you use one file (tabbed XLSX) to manage not only products, but also smart/custom collections, and customers.  It give us the ability to manage almost all catalog information in one spot.  The app interface is also incredibly handy including both the import/export status and result feedback that helps us identify any errors and how to fix them.
Best of all is the support.  Maris has been quick to respond and even has pro-actively asked us if he could help when we were having issues.  In one instance he even made a change to how the app was handling import errors within a few hours of seeing what was happening with our files.  I highly recommend this app."
"Like the simple interface, offers a consistent reminder about the cart. Definitely increases add to carts so far, have to wait to see what the effect on conversions is, doesn't necessarily enhance intent."
I tried the App today and it only took 10 mins to set it up! The interface is intuitive and the app is very helpful! Recommended.
"Best APP for anounces and bars.
Very easy to use, minimal interface and clean design.
 I recommend it!"
"[UPDATE 10-FEB-2020] -- I removed USO today. Since Pixel Union acquired Supple, they made it look pretty and changed to the Polaris interface.
But they didn't do much more than that on this app. Believe me, I tried. Countless emails, live chats and videos with the team. Super nice folk -- but they kinda watched while others build a better mousetrap. My new solution uses two apps to accomplish discounting, including BOGO, discount tiers, BXGY, and discount links -- and UX. The overall quality is insanely great. I'm dropping USO to 3* because it doesn't play nicely with shareable discount links from Shopify (which means apps that use these codes, such as Smile.io) and the popups are butt ugly. Pixel Union could have made it better... time to move on.
[UPDATE Sept 8, 2018: I STILL THINK USO is the most important merchandising tool in my store.]
[UPDATE Nov 17, 2017: I STILL THINK USO is the most important merchandising tool in my store. Even after a re-theme (now on Turbo).]
My store migrated Shopify in January 2016 -- and I was immediately frustrated with merchandising options, lack of BOGO, and upsells were just not intuitive. Is there an app for that?
I first started using Bold Upsell since (at the time) it was the only game in town, but for months I was desperately looking for a better solution. In my opinion, Bold Upsell is a 1-star app due to all kinds of customer facing UX issues and terrible, terrible support. Bold also believes presenting a customer with 3 upsell options is a good choice (no! every expert says one upsell, period!). Bold Upsell does not redirect to cart after accepting an upsell offer (customer stays on the page - totally bad UX). They offered custom development to solve this for about US$5,000. Pass.
I was also wanting to offer quantity breaks, and the only game in town was also from Bold:
https://apps.shopify.com/quantity-breaks
And I gave this app a 2-star review
Bold QB used hidden-products/hidden variants to solve this. It was a disaster. Read my review... posted on Jun 13, 2016
Simultaneously, I was trying to find a BOGO (buy X get y at discount)
and the only option at the time was Buy X Get One by Supple
https://apps.shopify.com/buy-x-get-one
And although I was uncomfortable with the limitations, at the time, the only way to do BOGO was using BuyX... but BuyX had a laundry list of incompatibilities, and in my opinion, I had to find a better way to do BOGO. Hidden products/variants didn't feed Facebook feed and it didn't play nice with OneClickUpsell and other integrated apps. But it NAILED the logic rules for BOGO, the customer facing UX was perfect, and the developer kept making it better...
In January 2017, the developer of this app (Ultimate Special Offers - USO) told me he had been working on a better mousetrap for about a year...
tl;dr There is no finer app at this time for discounts, upsells, BOGO, quantity breaks, and other special offers.
Marius is a pleasure to work with, and although I have probably been a total PITA during onboarding, this app is ""Best-in-class"" for merchandising for Shopify at the time of this writing. Email communication has been exceptional.
We are using USO for:
1. BOGO (such as buy any lipstick and get another, in any color, for 50% off)... WITHOUT USING HIDDEN VARIANTS and now, NO DRAFT ORDERS!!!!!!!
2. Auto add-to-cart of free item -- we use JustUno for popups and an effective marketing campaign offers the visitor a success page if she subscribes... and the ""prize"" is a link that automatically adds a free item to the cart. USO handles this perfectly.
3. UPSELL -- a well thought out and well-designed UX for the ""would you like fries with that?"" scenario -- this is UNLIKE other so-called upsell apps that analyze and make an offer in the cart -- well, you can... but... the magic here is product specific upsell offer -- a makeup brush that perfectly pairs with a powder, etc... These upsells convert.
4. Quantity Breaks. Without hidden variants!!
...among other things
This app is deep, and now (28-MAY-2017) that ""draft orders"" are a thing of the past, there is nothing else out there in Shopify app-land that comes close.
DO NOT be confused that this app has a variety of offers--  that's the whole point.
And now, with the addition of stacked special-offers + coupon code discounts, and also passing a discount code from URL parameter also shares with USO, this is The Most Powerful discount app available.
There are few things that I would like to see to make it ""more perfect"" - including hooks to a recurring payments app, such as ReCharge -- but with the recent API announcements from Shopify, this may not be needed soon...
The BIG TAKEAWAY here is Supple has engineered a way to offer BOGO and Quantity Breaks without hidden products/variants and without using draft orders. And the upsell UX is the best in class."
"Great app. When we first installed the app, we were a bit hesitant because of all the other faulty wholesale apps in the app store. To our surprise, Ultimate Special Offers did a clean job of utilizing Shopify's API to create a seamless wholesale user experience. While the app did not originally perform all the functions we needed, Marius and his team were quick to add new features that we requested. As of now, the app performs 90% of the features we could hope for (and probably serves most people's needs..we are just very picky :) ). Thank you to Supple Apps for finally making a pricing app that serves our wholesale needs!"
"Easiest install of all the apps we've used!
Very nice user experience and easy to customize.
Love the smooth zoom within the quick view."
"works great, but too many ads within the user interface"
"I found this app after a very bad experience with 2 other Review apps. First let me just say the user interface is seamless, doesn't look crappy like ones I've previously encountered. I got amazing customer support from Yusuf with helping me import reviews from a CSV file that wasn't properly exported. He even edited my store's theme to add the reviews on the homepage, I couldn't have done it on my own. Outstanding service! Thank you so much,  I am very pleased with this app."
I wanted a strong UGC video review flow to capture customer user experience. Yusuf took his time and explained everything to me step by step then also offered to jump into our site to fix up the widget as it wasn't displaying properly. I highly recommend this app. Also the price when compared to other apps in terms of features makes it value for money. 10/10 for me.
"Love the App, and the other application made from this company. They are amazing! The support team is fantastic as well, they have help us lots! This app is very easy to use, very dynamic and the interface is so great. We're really happy."
"A breathtaking app for reviews.
You can easily collect reviews & questions from customers, which both are getting displayed in an extremely good-looking way right under the product. Also, the design is highly adjustable for your own personal preferences. 
The interface of the app is super smooth, you are getting guided through the whole process of setting-up your reviews, so you really don't have to be an expert here!
There is also a free plan available, which includes a ton of features, so that is also extremely accommodating on HelpfulCrowd's part.
Another absolute highlight is the customer service, which goes above & beyond to help you with every single issue you're experiencing, until a solution has been found.
After trying several other review apps for my store https://printeddream.de , I can say in all honesty that this one has left me with the best experience by far & if you're also looking to include reviews into your store, look no further."
"simply great and this is what i was actually looking for, 100% recommended!... PS: user friendly interface"
"The app works, but it would be better if it integrated fulfillment in to Shopify. We have other apps that we use for dropshipping and they have a much more seamless user experience with the integration. Also, it would work better if it was explicitly clear what country the supplier was shipping from. It’s really time consuming to have to constantly check what the supplier deems as “domestic” just to figure out where they are shipping from."
"I have searched around for a few counterdown shopify apps and I found this is the best one. Free to use but the functionality is super rich:
- multiple counterdown timer template, with a lot of customization of style
- easy to insert the timer anywhere in my product page
- allow me to manually add the timer to selected products
- multiple timer is supported
- easy to setup and nice admin interface
- there are much more tiny tools to test with, which can help boosting sales in my store, will definitely try them out soon! Finally the CS is kind :) Very happy to use this app :)"
"very good, easy to use, the interface is very si.mple and simple, customer service is very patient....."
"Modalyst has by far the best interface to import, sync and purchase items. by far the best dropshipping addon i have used so far."
Using this app has been a breeze! Interface is very user friendly. Being able to filter shipping times is so convenient. I found many items to add  to my store and  quickly reached my limit on the Hobby plan. I will be upgrading to the Business plan which is a yearly and affordable. I wish transaction fees were cheaper on the other plans.
"I used this app to change the product descriptions of over 500 products. It would have taken me hours and hours of work, but instead was completed in minutes. Super easy interface, really clear options and so, so helpful for those situations where you need a lot of things done. I prefer this to Shopify's built-in bulk editor by a long shot; and it does more!"
"Best at all around
Features - 1. Countdown Timer (can be used for sales, discounts, different offers and for new launches)
2. Trust Badge (can be used for getting first sale, gaining trust of customers, reduce abondend rate)
3. Sales pop (can be used for sharing information with visiters such as recent activity, reviews, better deals, up/cross-selling etc.)
4. Live chat (can be used for connecting directly with customer by using Whatsapp, Messenger)
5. Inactive Tab (can used for getting back to store, providing discounts or coupons to customers, informing about their cart)
6. Sticky Add to cart (can be used for creating user friendly experience)
7. Add to Cart Animation (can be used for getting attention, getting more products in customers cart, for user friendly interface)
8. Multiple Facebook pixels (can be used for getting more accurate/effective insights for your Facebook ads)
9. Back to Stock (can used to informing only interested customers about restocking of any product) Bonus - Friendly customers care service"
"ShipStation is invaluable for when your business starts to take off. It does so much—easy shipping (of course), batching, and yes, REPORTING. I only have the cheapest Shopify account type so the basic-but-useful reporting is much appreciated. Sure, the interface is dated and could use a tweak here and there (I'm a user experience expert as well, so this could be my bias) but its utility totally compensates for the look & feel. Also, the customer support is fantastic. Write an email and get an answer from a real live human being who speaks fluent English. Hooray!"
I started using this app to increase my sale. The interface is so easy and the support is amazing. I'm looking forward to a good result.
"Great idea and eventually will very likely be good. In the current version, it caused more problems than it solved. EDIT: I'm still using the app with the hope it works better in the future, it's a great idea.
The integration is done by adding a product to your inventory, which they don't tell you. This means that any dynamic product display could potentially show the the insurance product. We immediately saw it in our dynamic ads, recommended product widgets, also bought widgets, new products, trending products, and in our automated emails. There are some workarounds for parts of this, but not all.
The one claim we had failed because the customer contacted us first and needed immediate help. 
The new widget is defaulted to ""on"" so it's automatically added to the customers bill unless they turn it off. After a few customer complaints about this, we had to disable the app. (There isn't actually a way to disable the app, I added css display: none and put the product out of stock) - EDIT: They fixed the widget so it no longer defaults to the on position.
Support is slow to respond and does not do much to actually solve problems. For an app that would ideally lead the way for our customer support, this was a bad sign. User experience and ultimately reviews mean everything to our business, so is just isn't worth the risk for us. EDIT: Communication has improved and we're working together to address all of my concerns."
Impossible to beat this app! Reasonable prices! Easy interface! Great customer service! A money maker machine!
"I just installed this, but so far so good. Everything is simple to navigate & you get a much more beautiful user experience when it comes to orders/invoices."
"I was looking for such an app which allow us to add testimonials in easiest way and this app has all those features.
Easy to use and nice interface. Great app."
"We love ShipStation!  We had been using several other shipping programs and ShipStation is the far superior program.  We are able to ship more orders, much faster, and with less errors.  Not to mention, the customer services is awesome and the interface is so much more aesthetically pleasing.  The only complaint we have had is that there is no way to schedule shipping notifications to be sent later (and not right when the label is created).  If ShipStation could implement this, it would be so great!"
"Update 2/3/16 - It's been about a year and a half since using Shipstation. It is by far the best on the market due to its frequent feature updates, customer service and intuitive interface. GET SHIP DONE :)
--2013--
Shipstation has helped my Beer Art business,""Craft Beerd"" in the following ways:
- Efficient order tracking
- Discounted postage
- Batch processing of mailing labels
- Stat tracking of popular items, etc
- filtering products to view for a specific reason
So far so good!
Cheers, Rudy

"We're new to online sales and retail, so shipping was the most daunting of all tasks.  ShipStation has really made it less overwhelming for us and we are very pleased with the entire application and user experience."
"These ppl are HORRRRIBLEEEE.... you can NOT reach them when you need too. They do NOT answer questions directly, only give you the runaround and their tutorial videos are unclear and have no sound. 
They REALLY need to work on their interface with this app and make the transition from ordering through your store a smooth one. I had numerous customers cancel order b/c once ordered on the store, was NOT able to finish the order on the app due to lack of customer service. 
Until they fix the problem, try Oberlo. they have better customer service. 
This app is a EASY pass !! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY"
"If i could write a -5 stars, i'd do it. Worst dropshipping app ever! Try anything else but this app! No customer service. If you want something user friendly, DONT USE THIS APP! They are still in the 90's... worst interface ever and PLUS, they charge fees per month!! I just don't get it... Hate it."
I've tried many apps on Shopify and ReConvert have a modern and easy to use interface. On top of that their chat support is excellent. Replies were quick and the support were knowledgeable. The widgets for the thank you page is easy to setup and interface looks good.
Vladimir was very helpful! Great app experience and customer service. Amazing user experience and helps with upsells!
"Ship Station has been a game changer for us - our order fulfillment times have been cut in half.  The interface is intuitive and packed with great features.  Ship Station enables one to do seemingly simple things (though things not always included in competitor's products) like printing large batches of shipping labels in the same order as your packing slips (seems simple but it wastes tons of time to have to collate on your own) and also more advanced things like editing the look and feel of the shipping confirm email that goes out to a customer when their order ships.  
Overall, we're super pleased we made the jump to Ship Station.  Highly recommended for any growing business!"
"awesome shipping management software!!! really great. i use it daily to fulfill my orders (that come in also from ebay and amazon) i would recommend it to anyone. one really useful feature for me is the fulfillment slider. on one (apple-stlye) flick of a 'slider' interface - i ship myself or from my amazon warehouse - automatically, one click. no problem. so smooth!"
"This app is perfect for us! It gave us a super classy invoice to print for customers in just a matter of minutes after making a few quick customizations with the super easy, customization user interface! Love it, and definitely recommend it to anyone searching for a very affordable alternative to the goofy looking, “horsey” invoices that come with Shopify or the only somewhat better upgrade to Shopify Order Printer! Such a better presentation for your customers!!"
"Shipstation is by far the best shipping solution. We started with another shipping solution with Shopify before I discovered ShipStation. After trying ShipStation, I was instantly sold on the interface and the features it provided. 
Pros: Very Intuitive Interface, Discounted rates via ExpressOne, Bulk Shipping Capability, Automation Rules, Excellent Customer Support."
"LOVE!  This app works and is worth the extra per month.  It is a great user interface, and it gets the job done!  Prints pack slip and postage on 1 page, no credit card fees when purchasing postage (at least that I could tell!), and no server problems so far and logical UX for the most part.  I wish it could be easier to make the weight of the package increment at different # of items in cart (like first item includes box, thereafter just product weight).  They offer it but I couldn't get it to work correctly...
Overall, I spent a lot of time trying to get another ship app to work for me, but every time I had to ship, something would go wrong.  Totally different experience with Shipstation, which is why for me I give a big smiley face for this app."
"Very good app, customer service amazingly fast. Does it's job well and templates interface is crafted to look like shopify's one. Do recommand !"
"This was a mistake. Only works in Chrome desktop browsers with a plugin. Even then there are many site errors returning a page full of error code. With patients you can add products but the interface is from the 1990s.
Ultimately, I found a better solution from a competitor."
"This is a wonderful app, within just a few minutes it solved a large problem for me that I didn't think anyone had a solution for-- to simply post my Shopify blogs to Facebook in a consistent, streamlined, and traceable manner. I produce content that is targeted to the website and to different social platforms. With this tool, I can simply copy-and-paste a link (in this case a blog entry) and then ""shout out"" it to Facebook with a nicely formatted post and picture from my blog-- no separate image uploading, copying text, etc, just copy the link in and publish. I didn't use the scheduling tool (autopilot)-- I disabled that feature as I learn the tool.  You can simply shout-out on demand which matches my model at the moment. This only scrapes the surface for this tool, it's about the most basic thing it does and it's a very big timesaver. The pricing model is very generous, they don't charge a monthly fee but instead only charge by post and they give a large number for free. The portal interface is very nicely done and easy to use. Everything I've done so far is at no cost. I plan to expand my use of the tool and putting time into finding ways I can use it, anytime I get immediate ROI like this, and at no upfront cost to-boot, I know I have a winner."
"Super easy to use interface and even custom support! Great app, very recommended"
"The bottom line is that the app doesn't have a great interface and is a bit clunky, but it has two vital positives: 
1. Support is immediately available, and they stick around until your problem is solved or they get back to you. I've used their live chat support on two occasions, both were pleasant experiences.
2. You have complete freedom to import ANY product/sellers' products from Aliexpress. This makes it 100x better than Oberlo which limit you to only manufacturers they accept.
Conclusion: they're far from perfect but definitely worth it if you're sick of Oberlo's terrible search & listings."
"The user interface is a little clunky and not easy to get used to, but the product works as it should and the online tech support is very helpful. So far, so good!"
"We could not be more thrilled with ShipStation. We compared it to the other options and were won over by ShipStation's beautiful, intuitive interface, its tremendous ease of use, its amazing automation rules, its attractive packing slips and labels, and its responsive and helpful support team. We love the savings on our priority mail shipments too. We find it useful too for things we don't even ship through the major carriers it supports. We ship freight. ShipStation automatically tags those orders for us and determines if residential or commercial so we don't have to ask customers at checkout. I could go on - because shipping is so fast I feel I have the extra time. :-) But I won't. Just try it. Worth every penny!"
"Truly amazing!  I've used ordercup, ordoro, and many others in the past.  After trying Shipstation, I was instantly sold on the interface and features it provided.  Shipstation makes it possible for anyone to start shipping without any knowledge of the program...that's how simple it is!  Don't waste your time with other shipping apps, this is the only one that is going to make you happy day after day.  SkinSeven.com LOVES shipstation!"
"if you want an app that makes sense and makes your shipping logistics easy in the process, go with ShipStation. We started with another shipping app but soon after discovered ShipStation and switched without looking back. Pros: great interface, fast, bulk shipping capabilities, email updates to customers re: tracking, and order automation. I'm impressed overall by the offering."
I tried out all the shipping apps and ShipStation was the best one out there.  The interface is easy to use and once you set it up it literally takes a couple clicks to print the label/packing slips. It saves us a ton of time.  Thanks shipstation!!
"ShipStation is the perfect solution to our shipping needs.  In less than 10 minutes, we had set up our USPS carrier and were off printing labels and getting our orders out the door.  The reporting is excellent and the interface is intuitive and easy to learn."
"At first I had issues printing to my Zebra LP2844 via OSX and Shipstation. I left a poor review due to these frustrations, but after Shipstation contacted me, I was able to resolve the issue, which had to do with subpar Zebra drivers. Not too surprising since they do not support OSX. I bit the bullet and bought a DYMO printer which works perfectly.
Of all the Shopify apps I have tried, this is the most valuable and useful I have found. It looks great and the interface is intuitive. It has plenty of integrations with shipping accounts and insurance providers. Here and there I run into something that is not obvious how to change or is lacking, but I get an explanation as to how to do what I want or a logical reason why it isn't possible from support.
I don't want to even think about how chaotic fulfilling orders would be without an app like Shipstation and I think they pull it off better than the alternative that I tried previously."
"I had been using another shipping program with Shopify before I discovered Shipstation. I tested it out for a day and was hooked. Not only was the interface extremely intuitive, but the program works great and the customer service is second to none. Go for it!"
"AWESOME APP!! there used to be only one app that takes care of shipping on shopify sites.  I'm glad that shipstation now supports shopify. the interface is very nice and easy to navigate. you can even track sales! it also saves me money since i didn't have to sign up for two separate accounts for both my shopify stores. the usps rate is also much lower than any services I've ever used had to offer.
a couple of things i wish they have is the shipment status on the shipment page. i would love to be able to see the status of each order/shipment in a glance without having to track one by one. Endicia has this feature and it's quite useful. another thing is that i wish the system updates the orders automatically without having to click ""update"" every time.
all in all, it's a solid app. would recommend to all shopify stores with shipping needs. i'm glad they came into shopify world! competition does make better products!"
"I love, love, love this app.  We had been struggling with managing shipping as we have two different shopify websites and we sell on Amazon as well.  This has made a world of difference in productivity.  It's a fantastic interface, very user friendly, and the rates are competitive.  It truly has helped us manage our workflow.
Not only is the application itself great, but ShipStation customer service has been superior, as well.
Overall I am very, very pleased and will tell everyone they should give it a try!!"
"AWESOME APP!! we used to use ordercup because it was pretty much the only man in town. i'm glad that shipstation now supports shopify. we tried it out and decided to cancel ordercup right away! the interface is much nicer and less confusing. the whole process is smoother. and you can even track sales! it also saves me money since i didn't have to sign up for two separate accounts for both my shopify stores. the usps rate is also much lower than ordercup. 
a couple of things i wish they have is the shipment status on the shipment page. i would love to be able to see the status of each order/shipment in a glance without having to track one by one. Endicia has this feature and it's quite useful. another thing is that i wish the system updates the orders automatically without having to click ""update"" every time.  
all in all, it's a solid app. would recommend to all shopify stores with shipping needs. i'm glad they came into shopify world! competition does makes better products!"
"ShipStation freaking rocks. I gave up on OrderCup about one minute after installation, is it was confusing, hard to use, required other software, etc etc. 
Well, ShipStation is everything that OrderCup isn't - well-designed, easy to use, intuitive, and doesn't require you to download a bunch more software or register for other services to use it. In fact, you get a free Endicia account with your ShipStation signup - all of the registration, postage purchasing, and everything else is handled by the ShipStation interface. You can run multiple stores, have multiple warehouses,  print postage labels and packing slips, set up rules and filters to automatically set your preferred shipping method for different types of orders..  ShipStation has it all, including a bunch of graphing and analytics whose details I won't bore you with here. 
Even more impressive is how solid ShipStation feels for a version 1.0 application. If this is the kind of quality the developers brought to their first-version application, I can only imagine what the future brings for this app. I am a customer for life, ShipStation! You guys rock."
If I could choose what was the best APP I could choose for my New Shopify store - THIS WOULD BE IT. Get a hold of ALL your Social Marketing with this easy to use completly interfaced to all your products tool.
"A very powerful tool in up-selling customers. Highly recommend as it does a great job in upselling customers with a very easy-to-use ""Shopify"" style interface for designing Order Confirmation Pages. The reporting is detailed and the integration is seamless."
"It can certainly do the job, even complex jobs. I look forward to the evolution of the user interface though - would love to be able to manage my hundreds of variables more easily, bulk upload, back them up, download, check for accuracy etc"
"Easy to use, and the interface of the app is great."
"This app is pretty easy to use. I've used several different apps for product options, and Infinite Options is by far the best in terms of speed and user interface. The cost is reasonable too, and the customer support is great. I've sent in several queries and all were replied within 24 hours. Great app! Keep up the good work, team!"
The best $29 I've ever spent on a Shopify app. Beautiful interface that just works! Can't fault it. Take your ugly-ass Shopify invoices to the next level.
It does not get better than this service.  Such an easy user interface and powerful way of reaching out to all the social media outlets.
"Great customer experience and love the app so far. Very easy to use and good user experience. I would highly recommend this app for a simple, easy to use pop-up functionality."
easy to use. works perfectly for our custom options. inspires us to find new ways to utilize for a better customer/user experience. personally have appreciated the support I've received from the company when needed. easy option to pay a small fee and allow someone more qualified to do the important stuff. very responsive with chat requests. highly recommend this app and this company
"User friendly + very easy to customize. I was resistant to pop ups, but I've doubled my email list in a month. My one complaint is that the cutomized settings (e.g. how often you set the popup to appear) don't apply to your shop's mobile interface, so I had to email them to personally change the mobile popup. Aside from that: fabulous."
"They have problems with billing and reported data in their user interface:
1. In dashboard, part of successful instagram posts were reported as failed.
2. I use autopilot option with a task that doesn't include weekends, yet, on weekends, although no posts are scheduled for this task, I still get charged for them!
3. If you go to Activity, it shows only last 4 days and crops the rest. It doesn't scroll down at all even if I wait 30 minutes .
4. their famous dashboard, if you try to find number of successful posts for all or any social media, guess what you get? number of lines! so if a product is posted on multiple social medias or reposted on the same social media, it is counted as 1 in the total
After all the above faults, and god knows what else is hidden, as I newly joined  this app, I received this reply to my 2nd query:
""we are a small yet bright team, charging next to nothing for the services we are providing, and we cannot afford to provide such personalised service every time. If you are not satisfied with our response rates, despite answering your numerous queries on the same issue, we would have to let you move on to another better service with a heavy heart. At present, we are not equipped to meet your expectation levels. As and when in the future we expand our team further, we would be more than happy to welcome you back.    ""
**** I got a new update now from them after they saw my review ****
I thought they would pay attention to their weak points and fix the listed errors. I got the following instead! (Somebody has a big head. Doesn't accept feedback. WoW):
""​Thanx for the review on Shopify forum. We are closing your account with​ Outfy and your unused credits would be refunded back to you. We don't meet your level of expectations, so its better for you to move on to a better app, as per your standards."""
An easy to use service with a low one off fee. You don't need to know anything about coding as it comes with a user-friendly interface to customise each template.
"Awesome app. Simple and clean interface that makes it easy to use. Also, set up was very quick."
"Awesome app! I love all the options to add to user experience.
Support is there when you need it.
Highly recommended!"
"The app is solid and provides a lot of useful functions, but it has some limitations that we cannot work around for our business.
The biggest example is the necessity to create a new product for every option that adds a cost.  We have many artisinal items that are extremely customisable and exporting the data involves exporting a lot of unecessary SKUs that we will alter need to delete when all we need to do is increase the base value of the product variant.
Also the conditional logic does not interact very well with the basic variants set up by Shopify.
Finally, swatch sizes are small and there are very few options for managing how information is displayed.  An accordion option would go an awfully long way to improve the user experience.
These criticisms are purely from our perspective and we udnerstand the demands of our product range are severe.  Overall it is a good application, but not the right fit for us."
"We just canceled our Hootsuite account and moved to Outfy. Below are the main reasons for our switch:  
1. Uploading images takes the longest when scheduling our posts in Hootsuite, and bulk editing is restricted to creating a CSV document, which we find to be unnecessary work. In Outfy, there is no effort, because all your products are populated. 
2. We found the interface very streamlined and intuitive. 
3. We can now streamline posts of all products on all our social media sites plus several others we signed up with because of Outfy. Has saved us much time. 
4. Although Hootsuite gives a view of your competitors, there are other ways to do this without paying to use their social media posts feature. Crazy to compare a Shopify apps technology to the behemoth Hootsuite, but Outfy's technology is more intuitive and exactly what a business needs to more simply streamline social media activities. 
All the best to you in your online business! www.ArtUrbane.com"
"Great App. Exactly what we were looking for.  Easy to use interface, the customization is what we needed to make the pop-up window specifically our own.  Can't wait to test it out in the field. 
*2/2/18: 
We had a small glitch happening with the app where the app wasn't working properly. The Support team took care of the problem and fixed it right away."
"Pretty good and neat app. Simple interface and works well.
Have just tried it for a couple of days and it's impressive."
"This is an amazing app, does all it claims to do and more! The interface is gorgeous and its extremely easy to use! Customer support is also excellent. Very very happy!!! Thank you!"
"Just what we've been looking for! 
The apps interface is clean and easy to use, how it pulls in your information, including the product images is really handy and leaves your invoice looking sharp and professional.
The developer is also very helpful and quick to respond to any questions. 
Good stuff!"
"The app has an easy user interface. I have used this on another store and it helped to reconvert. If you have many good products but not advertising them on social media, then reconvert is the next best to showcase the product and get them sold!"
"Great app for post purchase upsells. Easy to use interface. Some extra CSS options would be nice, but that can be done through file editor. This is a no brainer and is basically free money. Highly recommended. Vladimir was very helpful via support as well!"
Vladimir did an amazing job helping to add a survey on my checkout ! Thanks. I recommend this app if you want to improve the user experience of your website.
"I use this app for many things:  gift wrapping option, bundle products, special notes/tags on special products.  Don't let the simple user interface fool you--this is a very sophisticated system.  Before using for my bundles, I literally checked every bundle app out there.  By far, this is the best one out there.  It let's me configure very easily and also allows for discount codes to be applied.  Also:  the customer support is extremely responsive and helpful.  In addition to actual thoughtful explanations to my inquiries (vs. template responses), they troubleshoot by fixing my liquid files directly.  I have multiple shopify stores and use dozens of apps for each--this is my favorite."
"Awesome app! Easy to use, clean interface, and amazing support."
"An amazing multifaceted app. Nice interface. Clean design. Easy to get working and excellent, personalized customer support. Thanks!"
So far so good!  I tried many other social promo apps and this has the most options and easiest interface that I have found.  Stuart - www.casepirate.com
"Of all the Product Options apps for Shopify this one worked the best for us. It's interface is intuitive. It's options are flexible. And the customer support was incredible! Fast, Fast, Fast responses which is always key for our business. Great job and thanks!"
I like this App a lot for Post Purchase Upsells. Interface is easy and overall experience very smooth.
I found outfy and they fit perfectly with my shopify.  Very friendly and easy to understand interface.
"Easy interface. Wanted to use it as a upsell app for orders made with Paypal, great options to do so. Vladimir guided me through the process and made some great points. 5 stars!"
"I used this app to personalise my products and it's very simple to use. I had a few questions, but the support team has helped me through it all. They have been amazing. I would recommend this app if you want to add personalisation to your products. It's easy to use and affordable - I'm so happy to pay for a great product like this that I can afford as a start-up business. There are heaps of plans to suit your needs. It's so easy for customers to use, which is really important for user experience and the design of the personalisation is great too. Give it a go!"
"The guys behind this app is awesome. They have live support and answering anything to you quickly.
The app is also very easy to use. It's straight and has a very nice user experience.
Words can't describe how cool the whole thing is! Give it a chance and try it for yourself! :)"
"Been looking for an app interface that saves me time on updating tedious social media channels simultaneously. So far so good, It does what it's supposed to do and I hope I can stick with it unlike with most other Shopify apps."
"Updated review:
I have installed the app and uninstalled it around two weeks ago, gave the app 3 stars due to some issues I contracted. I got an email from the developers to give it another shot and LUCKILY I did. 1st- The support is 24/7, I do not get why some reviews are saying that support does not exist or is too slow to reply, if this happens then there must be a reason, after all, we are all humans and the developers are no machines. try to be nice when even leaving a 1 star review.
2nd- not one issue I had and the support team did not help me out with, sometimes they add new features to meet my needs and this shows that those guys are def doing their best and hard workers.
3rd- I am an extremely picky perfectionist person and I asked for tiny demands and all I got in return was an extremely polite and supportive team, thank you.
4th-The interface of the app is very easy to understand just give it a shot to surf around and ask the support any questions they will reply on the chat immediately.
5th- I have tried other apps and nothing comes close to this one in terms of ease of use, options, price, and support. Don't waste your time looking elsewhere, this app can meet all your shop's needs if you are looking for product personalization.
Thank you, Developers and Support team, I am 100% happy that I reinstalled the app!!"
Enjoying learning how to use Outfy.  Good interface and it connects to more networks than any other software we've found.
Really good customer service via chat. Very good app interface. Very good price. Good value. Worth it.
"Awesome app, Kudos to the Outfy Team!
The posts are beautiful and you can post to Social Shopping sites that are not commonly available through apps. 
The Mobile app lets you post your products to Instagram and it works great, very easy to do. Better yet, it's available for IOS and Android. I use both devices and to me it's a definite plus, so many mobile apps are not available or don't work well on Android. Outfy does!
Developer stays in touch and emails when new features are available. Outfy just gets better and better. Their newest feature (Shoutout) is really useful.
The Outfy team really cares about their clients. If you ever need Support, it is lightening fast (do you guys ever sleep?) but generally speaking it is very easy to set up and use, very intuitive interface..
It's our Social Marketing HQ, has excellent stats. I love the pay as you go plan too and have purchased credits.
Try it out, you will be glad you did!"
"It took me a few requests to figure out the interface, but customer service was very responsive. This app did everything I needed it to do. The options are more extensive than the other personalization apps I tried - and I tried a lot of them! You can also easily see the customer's preview and download their jpgs on the back end. Many of the other apps didn't do this. Overall, I'm very happy with the app!"
"Great price, interface, and service! I really like how easy it is to use this app compared to other email apps."
"I'm so impressed by the infinite options app and the shoppad team, they were extremely responsive, helpful and even made additional suggestions for how I could improve my user experience!"
"Great app, works without problems and very easy to set up. The interface is simple and straightforward and it was very easy to get everything working and looking good even in the free version. Might switch to the paid version soon for the extra options."
"I like this app very much. I ask for customer support in the middle of the night when I have a question. The 7X24 service is very good. They also helped me to set it up in the background. Very satisfied. Now that there is a Chinese interface, I love it even more."
"I added this app to test product options and intended to upgrade for conditional product options.  The interface was straightforward, I had it up and running - but only half of it worked.  When I contacted support they were unable to fix it, twice.  I have a Shopify Theme, nothing fancy would really have liked what they claimed it could do.  It did not do what they claimed. - would not recommend."
"Fantastic Support, wonderful and easy going interface. Support responded immediately and did more than needed. Amazing. Thank You Kate form One. You are the best!))"
"Great app!
Numan was very helpfull assisting me to set up some specific changes on the interface that ended up improving the UX for my customers.
Don't hesitate and give it a try folks, you won't regret!"
"I have tested a range of apps for personalization, for me personally nothing has come close to this one, the functionality and user interface was  very simple to grasp right from the start. Especially the addition of conditional logic sets this app apart. One of the best things about using this app was the support, especially Arafath who went above and beyond to help us out with some fairly complex customization's. The price as well compared to some apps is extremely reasonable for what you get. Cant wait to see what updates they come up with in the future!"
Used this app for a pop up for newsletter signs up. App interface was a bit tricky but the customer service was F A N T A S T I C and helped me set up in no time. Definitely recommend for the customer service itself !
This app is great and the support team is incredible.  Easy to use and intuitive interface.  I highly recommend Product Personalizer to any shopify merchant looking to add personalization to their products.
I just started but the interface is well-conceived and I'm excited to see the results! There are a lot of possibilities!
"Amazing speedy support. A lot of real help. Not just ""we ban your sending, bye bye"" - but ""the issues you have are:1,2,3... This is what you have to do to solve them: 1,2,3..etc"". Interface is quite straightforward. I mean I've had some problems finding a button that was in front of my eyes :). Otherwise, I clearly get why these guys have 99.99% of positive reviews. Totally recommend. Full disclosure: I've sent around 2k emails so far. Not used other parts of the service yet, but can't see any future problems arising."
The customer service is great and the app saves you a fortune. Everything you need in one app and the user interface is so easy it makes it perfect for start ups.
"This app just keeps getting better and better.  Loving the updated interface, conditional logic, and we're now taking advantage of the image upload feature, which I hope will be exciting for our customers too.  Support is responsive and helpful.  Highly recommend this app for any store offering personalized products!"
"I can't speak to any results this app may provide. However, the fact that the user interface closely resembles the Shopify editor makes this app a breeze to use. Props for that."
This app does pretty much everything I need it to do and after some getting used to the interface it's fairly easy to use. Some hiccups here and there with renderings and sometimes slow to load but I am overall pretty happy with it.
"I have been developing my site using Product Personalizer for the past 3 weeks.  I had reviewed and compared many tools.  I was looking for the ability to provide my clients with a real time proof and a simply straightforward interface.  I ran into a few issues here and there and the developer was prompt to reply.  I recommended some functionality changes both on the back end and the front end.  To my astonishment, in a day or two all of my suggestions were implemented.  I am very impressed with the developers openness to change and timely responses.  Well worth the price paid."
"So far so good! Interface is very intuitive. Time to test it out. Would LOVE if additional options that get displayed could be conditional/dynamic based on selections in previous options (ie. option 1: pickup or delivery?, Option 2: Pick up location? (If chose pickup in opt. 1), or, Delivery Date and time? (if chose delivery in opt. 1)."
perfect app for building professional thank you pages that convert and optimize based on user experience which is the golden key in today's ecommerce atmosphere.
"I use this app to create pop ups to collect emails and now i am using it to automate emails and SMS, Kate has been really great in supporting me every step of the way! She is very patient and goes the extra mile of also suggesting what works best from user experience point of view, she voluntarily pointed out a few issues with my campaigns and this just shows how thoroughly she looks into my account. I appreciate that alot! This is what support is about, its to help u build whats right for your business not just the technical setup..all in all good App and great support"
"I used this app to customize my products and facilitate clients being able to upload text, upload multiple files and provide special instructions before fulfillment. I was able to install the app without issue and began using it right away. The interface was intuitive however I did need to read a few help pages as there were more options than I had anticipated.
A note on customer service: The support team was epic! I described my issue and received a response right away. The issue was resolved by a developer/tech in less than 24 hours.
I have one minor issue that needs attention but I'm confident they will resolve that too given my experience thus far.
Good Job Hulk Team!"
Very easy to setup and smart for the user experience. Great design options in all sections of post order UI
Great up! Easy to use User Interface. Videos to explain every thing in the app. I recommend this for upsells!!
Excellent interface and customer service by every single contact thus far. Makes the whole process a lot easier!
"5/5 app. I can see why there are hardly any negative reviews on this app. Amazing interface, endless offers, options & cross sells opportunities and top class friendly support. I would recommend this app to anyone. Well done & thank you"
"I had been working with CJ dropshipping for more than a year, one of their best features that I like a lot is that they have a customer service team 24/7, they can help you with any inquiry at any moment. They usually resolve any problem in just a moment. Other think that I like is that they keep you informed about everything that is going on with your shippings and they do really care about the user experience. The best part is how easy to use the platforms is, it is really easy to set up a new store in a couple of minutes and start selling inmediatelly. I will keep working with them for a long time, thanks CJ!"
"Great service and excellent customer support. My agent (Estelle) was able to find answers and solutions for all kinds of questions and requests. Easy to use interface, even with multiple tabs opened, great user experience. The only reason it's not 5 stars is that product search doesn't really find relevant results all the time, so that could be on the list for improvement."
I enjoyed the app. It was great. I also like that the User Experience and Interface is very similar to that of Shopify's backend theme editor.
"This is a great app that allows you not only add options, but build custom bundles with various pricing.  To top it off, this app is FREE and that is comparing to fairly expensive options out there from other similar apps.  But good app is nothing without support.  Even though the install process is fairly simple you may still run into issues.   Their support fixed it almost immediately.   That is something to be proud off.   They did it fast, efficiently and without ever bothering us. 
Bottom Line:
-Impressive app
-Simple interface with powerful features.
-Easy to use
-Great personal tech support
-It is Free."
"Just started using it, hope it will be great for my sales. interface is good and easy to configure..."
"I sell shirts in many colors, sizes, types and with customization options. I looked everywhere for an app to allow me total flexibilty. The Shopify system only allows 100 total variants so that caps me at 5 colors x 5 styles x 4 sizes = 100. No enough! ... and does not offer color swatches.
This FREE app from Hulk is incredible and so user friendly. Allows unlimited variants in a very simple interface and color swatches too!
Also, this is the only app that allowed me to so easily program CONDITIONAL variants, meaning variants that will only show up once client makes another selection. In my case, if customer click YES to customize the garment only then do the other variants appear with choice of customization options.
Finally, tech support is incredible, I wrote with a question regarding the app and they solved my issue within 24 hours. This app is 100% 5 stars in my book!"
I really love the easy user experience and all the features that allows a non marketing specialist to improve conversions and marketing campaigns.
Simple interface and works very well so far. Integrates well with the team and connecting with customers is fast.
"I use the CJ app for my online store and am very satisfied. At the beginning the user interface is a bit hard to get used to for Germans, but you can always request help from your agent via chat! He answers immediately and helps to solve problems! Once you get used to the app, you get along great with it."
"If you use iOS, this app is great! If not, move on. I was excited to use this app because it integrates so well with the rest of Shopify, however many of the features are only available if you are using the iOS app (availability hours, saved replies, link to products and discounts, etc). Desktop and Android only give you access to the basic chat without the ability to edit any of the settings or more advanced chat options. Hopefully they update the desktop interface to include the ability to manage settings and full chat options, because everything else about it looked really promising and easy to use. Installation was very easy, the only issue is that the chat button is enabled automatically before you've customized any settings. It's easy to disable so just be aware to do that if you are not ready to start customer chats right away."
"I wanted to make a special comment for CJ Dropshipping and especially to my agent Phoebus. I've been hearing a lot of sh*tty reviews on CJ Dropshipping. First of all it's free, so you're not in right to ask for prestige service. Second, yes their interface is not the best in the world, but it's on you to get over it and know how to use it (again it's free!!). They offer a LOOOT of features though. Another thing is that they always answer. There is always someone, 24/7 that is here to assist you, and it never took more than 15 seconds to get an answer. Yesterday, I asked my agent Phoebus to prepare for me special bundle with certain variants. And they did that, in 24 hours, like they promised. Special Shout out to my agent Phoebus, great service, great quality, super prices, super shipping times. Super nice agents, I recommend."
"So far so good! Love how easy it was to set up. Simple interface, app on my phone - just turn on notifications!"
"I used this app, and it's great. It has a great interface and it's easy to use. You has lot of feature"
"Love the app. easy and exceptional user experience.                                                                                
Super good service, they reply quickly and explain very good!"
"The app is really friendly in price, it is free for first 50 cross sell and gradually increase in price so it is best for starters. The interface is pretty friendly and there are tutorials available to aid you throughout the journey. Definitely recommended."
WOW WOW WOW!!! This is such an amazing app. The user interface is amazing. So easy to use. Customer service is perfect! I will surely be using ONE+ as my business continues to grow. 10/10!
"The chat support is very friendly, great, the interface is very intuitive, you can modify colors, images, letters, pop-ups, social Proof, I can only say that it is wonderful and I was looking for an application like that, highly highly recommended."
The support team is super fast and helpful. The interface of the App is easy and user friendly! Highly recommend this app for your shop.
"The interface looks good, but they have too many bugs with manage inventory with Shopify. I spoke more than once with the support and explained that the inventory management is incorrect, for example, there is a product (SKU-CJJJCWGY03637) that managed by CJ in my Shopify store and it shows that the quantity is 9000, and on the CJ website it shows that there is 0 quantity that’s mean the CJ management inventory can let me sell a product that they don’t have !! I can’t rely on this service. They have big potential but I can’t trust them, and I spent too much time speaking with the support team without any fix."
I'm new to Shopify and I'm not really a techy person but this apps' flow is smooth; it's painless to use and the user interface is easy to understand. All the instructions are there. The customer service is also quick to respond.
"Discovered this app by chance. Extremely please with it. Very easy to use interface. This app can also bundle products together into the cart with product options. Thanks for making this feature! One more improvement: With product bundle, you can type in the price of the product(s) manually on the options available. It would be great if the currency of this price can change according to IP localisation in your coin app or shopify's native currency selection."
"So far so good! Intuitive interface, easy to set up campaigns and some unexpected extras. I will come back with more feedback as we move along."
"Great interface, easy to use. Fair pricing, I definitely recommend that you use Reconvert on your store."
"Vladimir was really awesome!  Explained the tools well - I just need to read and practice more.  
My store has only been live less than two weeks and although we are getting a lot of vies and have had over 20 orders, I want to speed things up.  
I like the interface of the app as it seems simple enough for someone IT-challenged as I am.  Looking forward to working with your team more!"
"Do NOT waste your time and money with these guys! Worst customer support experience ever! They lie, the make empty promises, they blame each other, and never deliver. Their user interface is so ridiculously complex and ugly and useless! I wish I could give them -5 stars!! And Shopify has to do a better job vetting these apps AND managing them... that's part of their value prop. So, it turns we can not have more than one supplier app connected to a Shopify store, as we run the risk of those apps having access to orders placed for other apps. Case in point, among our CJ orders we found orders meant for Oberlo!"
"TOP! Great support! Nice and easy interface and design. And many thanks to the free plan for the small shops:), definitely recommend."
"Absolutely love the app!
The interface is so incredibly smooth, it's unbelievable!
I've been using the app for quite some time now in my store https://printeddream.de  and it works just the way I want it to!
If you're looking for any type of sales Pop Ups in your store, look no further!"
"I have been using this app for only 2 weeks, so it's early days, but so far so good! The support was quick and helpful when I needed a little help setting up to integrate with the style of my theme. It's customisable to fit your theme and the features you want. I have found when I tested it out myself I was navigating around the site more, looking at more products in different collections. So I think customers should do the same hopefully! I installed this app as I wanted a smarter way to recommend other products as my theme just recommends products in the same collection. As I said it's early days, but I'm hoping it will increase my average spend per customer and create a better user experience."
"It's easy to use and opens within the Shopify interface, the documentation is good, and the CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS GREAT!
This app fills a huge gap in Shopify's capabilities!  It's free, really, and they aren't using your data or customer information in any way...(I double checked the privacy policy).  
The only thing it doesn't have that I want is dependencies between the option sets...hopefully in a future release it will!"
"We used a different platform when we started the business but glad to have switched to CJ. They do quality checks ensuring that the ordered package is correct before shipping out. If there are missing info, they would proactively send us notifications which we highly appreciate. Shout out to our former agent Katrina and our current amazing agent Yuki Z. for kind assistance as always! We would like to see some improvements on the new Fresh interface especially on the syncing of the old orders. Overall, highly recommended!"
We use this app to accentuate the options already present in shopify. it allows us to customize product options as we see fit and expand on the amount of variants needed to make a great user experience.
"This service sucks. They don't answer your request deliberately and try to missled you. Processing times are so bad. Customer service is the worst. They don't want to make a refund. Their interface is soooo ugly. They claim false shipping times. If i can give them minus 5, i would."
"Super helpful service, got exactly what I envisioned in no time at all! Easy interface, customizable, staff can change code in live time to tweak things."
"We used Infinite Options to support our product personalisation.  User experience is really important, as is the ability to make our entire site look consistent and easy to use.  Infinite Options works perfectly for us and the support has been excellent.  Thank you!"
"the app is nice, thou this is my first time using it and am new in the system, navigating through the app, checking all the awesome package and the thank you page for customer after purchasing good and checking out, very nice and good work, need more design of user interface for better customer  experience."
"We are very pleased with the functionality of this free app. We're using to it to put a note field only on specific products, which is easily accomplished through the app interface. The app is very easy to use and works exactly as we hoped it would."
"This is one of the great applications with well designed and user-friendly interface. All you need to do is just Click and Click and make appropriate settings as you wish.
Its performance goes without saying that you will be amazed in its result at appropriate price.
Highly recommended !!!"
"They source very fast the products from 1688 or other Chinese apps like T-mall, shipping in high season is very slow, but in general, the process is good, what they need to improve is their User Interface as is very hard to find the orders with the Shopify order number or even with the buyer name, skype customer service is good and latly when a product arrive wrong from supplier they send pictures and give options to cancel or exchange the order, they are getting better, sync conection with the store is fast as well even many times the images need to be downloaded by had as their app just takes a few of them, prices are fare."
"Amazing customer support, fast service. Lovely interface and great success on site with google integrations."
User friendly instructions and interface
"Really great app, very useful for adding many variations, and even better easier than using the native Shopify variants. 
There's hidden documentation that walks you through building a great date picker as well, which was super duper. Support is really fast and easy to chat with right from inside the app UI, thumbs way up for the user experience. 
My only reason for 4/5 instead of 5/5 is that they were missing a feature I was hoping would easily be implemented into the date picker (a time picker as well)."
"Very Helpful Developer. They handled the installation, and set-up my first form. The interface for this app is very interesting. It appears to provide much control. I am glad I had the developer set up the app - cause I may not have figured it out as quickly. 
The developer was very fast on responding to questions (and I had a few). Very helpful each time. Strong App and Sound Support. 
6/1/18 Really solid support. I had custom edits to formatting. ShopPad made everything look just how I needed it. Very professional. 
SO GLAD I CHOSE SHOPPAD APP"
"I was looking for a product review app that worked without costing the earth and with an easy interface. So glad I found this one. Had a few questions which were swiftly dealt with by Aditi, Subash and the rest of the team. Thank you!"
"Wow!! What can I say?
I installed the app and came across a nice user interface but I couldn't personally get the app to appear on my theme. This is likely due to my theme and not the app itself. After pinging off an email request for help I got an answer in about 5 minutes with the app installed more or less within that time. Amazing.
Frank later offered to perform some customisations so the recommendations would look more in keeping with my theme as well as being more 'consumer friendly' - much like Amazon's recommendations. In the space of a few emails, I have what I want and I'm really delighted with the look, the product and the service.
If I had to mention one slightly negative mark it would be that there is no integration for review ratings to appear on those recommended products, again like those masters Amazon use. 
It goes without saying that product reviews help boost sales and instantly draw a customer to a high grade product. We all go to such efforts to collect these reviews it seems a lost opportunity not to use them in this instance. 
However all is not lost as these guys are exploring a solution to do just this. Fingers crossed! 
So far so good with more to come it seems.
Many thanks Frank!!
Zak"
"an outstanding and highly responsive customer service
very easy to use interface thanks to Aditi from the support"
"The overall use is fairly smooth, and the interface is relatively simple and easy to understand.I hope the speed of opening the mobile terminal can also adapt to"
Great app so far. Easily started and imported from previous software. All another level of user experience and right pricing.
"awesome customer service!! love the app. user interface was smooth, user friendly app which is easy to use"
This app has the best and fairest pricing plan I've ever seen. The interface is super user friendly and the app is highly effective. Best app yet!
Amazing app. Very simple interface that helps not so tech savy to use the platform effectively and perfect free plan for beginners.
I downloaded this app today & Holden has made my experience a seamless one! I love the options it brings & the interface. Super helpful customer service!!
"Best app for upsell at checkout step, very easy tu use and nice interface. The support is really helpful too and first 50 orders are free!!! :)"
"The app is not user friendly, however the support from the agent - Danny is good. Would be a great app if the user interface is much more friendlier and easier to use. There are more room for improvement."
"Great for remarketing! Easy interface, too."
"J'ai découvert l'application il n'y a pas longtemps. Jusqu'à présent, tout va bien. Ils répondent rapidement aux demandes. Je peux discuter avec mon agent à tout moment, en privé sur WhatsApp et / ou skype. Les temps de livraisons sont correct et l'interface est sympa"
App is easy to navigate and they have great customer service! Clean interface. I was looking for a simple to use review app for my shop. Thanks!
"Great app! Simple interface that is very easy to get to know and use. I haven't tested all options (there are a lot!) but the 'Someone Bought' popup, review requests, countdown timer and shipping timer all integrate well on my store and work well. The stats you can get also give a good insight into what shoppers are doing and their journey. Recommend!"
I used the app to ensure that i could get good social proofing but also reviews. I think it is really good and the design and user experience is great as well. I always tell my clients to use Fera. I cannot wait to see mroe features.
Great features. It was easy to set up too. Fast and intuitive interface. Looking forward to getting our reviews in!
"Easy to install, intuitive interface, great support with actual human beings who will talk with you over the phone if you need assistance. Great app :)"
A recommended app to improve the user experience and invite them to buy again. 100% recommended ;)
Highly recommend this app! Intuitive and easy-to-use interface makes it really simple to set up. Customer service replied really quick when we had a time sensitive issue and they helped solve the issue on the back end to streamline the process. Thanks Fera!
"One of the top review-based app, a very easily understandable dashboard interface, and very prompt and professional chat support, all in a free plan. I would definitely recommend everyone to at least give this app a try."
I researched a lot of apps before landing on Fera. We've been using it for 2 months now and hasn't been disappointed -- interface is smooth and clean. Only feature I would request is the ability to ask a customer to re-edit a review that they submitted.
Great user experience and very helpful! Has already really helped us to gain reviews and customer experiences after only 1 week of using.
I really Loved it... Really easy to use this application for reviews. Very good interface leading to no time wastage during setup.
Great app for user reviews to lead your business! Highly recommend. Extremely flexible to use with great user interface.
"quick responses to my problems, great app. would easy to use and nice interface, would definitely use across all my stores."
works great! They made the interface looks like shopify. So is very easy to use. I wish they have more advance setting for the coupon code. Like to offer a percentage off or amount off base on order size.
"I loved the software interface to the customer and us vendors.
It's great that picture and video reviews are available even on very low-priced packages. I was able to look at 10 companies and say that they are the best by far."
"Service client rapide et efficace, interface facile à utiliser. On peut facilement modifier le design. Je recommande!"
Just started the free trial. Customizable thank you page template & nice upsell & reorder features. 4 star for the user-friendly interface and will leave my comment again if it brings good results.
"Easiest way you can ship reliably and brand. The user interfaced can be improved upon a bit to be more user friendly. Other than that, it's great!"
"I love the customer service and ease that this app offers, it is an amazing interface and support is amazing and quick"
"I use this app for my reviews of products sold. The review request is sent automatically and when the review is received I have a chance to write a comment. I was having problem with the new interface and don't find it user friendly. I did request help and got an answer within 24hrs, complete with screenshots to help me out. Customer support is great."
"A great app with great support. They will hook you up :) We received personalized assistance from the developers - they went above and beyond. This app does what it says it does - it will generate more revenue and profit. It's easy to use, especially because they make the interface very ""Shopify-like,"" so you will intuitively know how to set it up."
"Application remplie de fonctionnalité et différents widget pour amener son site à un autre niveau. Une interface dédiée et designé assez agréable, beaucoup d'options, et un service client à l'écoute et aidant. Je recommande"
Really useful and amazing. Easy to use. Really good features for the price. Smooth interface and embeds to your website nicely.
"Great app, very simple to use, friendly interface, no bugs so far, and most importantly does the job well.
Getting more orders, very happy."
"There is not so many apps that I really love and I find them necessary in my store. ReConvert is definitely one of them. 
With so easy interface, with many options available (and they are still adding the new ones) and with awesome customer service (they respond by Messenger in couple of minutes!) it's a really great app. 
And, what's important, it works! I do really recommend this app."
"Loved the app ... Great thing is its free
Great interface with very prompt integration
Great support"
Good app. It really helps to improve your site. I really enjoy the app interface its quite friendly and easy.
"This app is a great help to the sellers who want to list their products on Walmart.
Very simple to use, one of the most user- friendly app I  have used for integration.
If you get stuck or need assistance the support is impeccable.
The team is always there to assist you out in every possible way being screen share, calls, or WhatsApp.
Called me whenever needed and assisted me in through the screen share. Explained all the functionalities of the app and the Walmart seller center . Gave me their time and energy until all the things were clear.
Kushagra helped me through the whole process and was very patient in correcting my listing on Walmart.
Suggested me about the SEO and the tips through which we can increase the sales.
The features provided by the app are really amazing and the simple interface makes my work a lot easier.
Highly recommended !!"
"This is really helpful!!! We're trying to keep our costs down, and speed our site up. Thanks for providing this great utility with a really easy to use interface! It seems to be reducing the images nicely."
"I was amazed. I’ve tried many other apps regarding the Walmart integration and I found this one and this works exactly like what I wanted. Walmart’s user interface and their seller central is horrible to use, but this app make it so much easier. Inventory update works perfectly and just one click to import/export my products to the market. And they gave me a step by step instruction on how to successfully upload my products onto Walmart. Answered all my questions and also guided me in the right direction!"
Very help and kind. Customer services was able to give additional information and solved complex problems. They resolve and very responsive. The interface does need a bit of user friendly touches but that's because there is a lot of capabilities. I enjoy the help and learning about the integration which makes very seamless to do our work.
"Good interface, easy to use and setup. So far it's looking good."
Amaizing app and very useful to send campaings to clients. Interface is really good and easy to understand. Very good support that will help you to improve.
"so far so good!  
just installed and is easy/straight forward and has a nice interface  and colour options! 
very versatile, helpful 
thx!"
"Easy to use app to get your products listed on Walmart.  Syncs your catalog, orders, and inventory.  Walmart interface is hard to work with, this makes things a lot easier.  Be aware that you'll need to use the Walmart product files if you have multiple images and swatches for variants.  Customer support helped along the way when there were any questions or concerns."
"I was looking to have a fine app that could manage my listings for Walmart. I tried many apps out there but none of them seemed to be so helpful as this Walmart Integration. This app is simply amazing.
I installed the app within a few minutes I completed the set-up and reach the app dashboard. Then came a beautiful interface and well-built sections within the app, to manage the entire product and order business details. There is another feature for improving listing on Walmart “Recommended and Optional Attributes” this allows you to add additional attributes to your product and in turn help in product visibility on Walmart. Also, I needed to manage my products specifically with lowered prices and the repricer feature easily helped solve that requirement. There are a lot of other features that make this app wonderful!
I contacted Ced and they guided me in deep detail about the app and its uses. After getting help from I came to know that there is so much to know and learn about Walmart. The way they help sellers is simply incredible.
This app has everything you need to manage for Walmart sales. It's no doubt that this app is rated the best as it got the best workers.
I got Walmart sales within some time after using this app. That's superb!
I highly recommend this app. Truly an awesome experience with it."
Still on free trial and have not yet saw any sales but very easy user interface and analytics. Was able to set up the emails in 10 minutes too!
Fantastic app and even better support. The team are very proactive with you getting the most out of your account and help you every step of the way. An incredibly user friendly interface and campaign set up. Highly recommend.
Walmart is by far a pain to work.  Going directly through Walmart seller Central is a nightmare.  This app helps you navigate the nightmare of selling on Walmart.com.  The apps interface is evolving and adding products to Walmart using this app is getting better.   So far the support has been wonderful.
I thought this app would not work but 8 days later I already had way more subscribers vs my email popups! All I did was install the app and literally forgot I had it! I now see the huge potential for push notifications! After speaking with Rameez I realized that I need to start putting more attention towards customizing the notifications for my user experience! I am 100% confident I will buy this app as it has already proven it has the ability to generate subscribers who actually will see the push notifications vs email where my open rates are low... I would recommend this app to ANY Shopify store the free plan is also very generous! Thank you!
"We love Pushowl. The user interface is clear, simple, and accessible. But the best part of the app is the amazing, personal support we receive. Rishika is extremely knowledgable and has provided us recommendations and support that have translated directly to increased sales. The software is good, but the people behind it are what really makes Pushowl as effective as it is."
Responsive and proactive support. Easy to use interface. Good enough free plan for us to make sales. Upgrade when you are growing. PushOwl is one of the easiest web push notifications.
"Easy to use interface and very clean template. Only loses one star for not being very well optimized to use on android, but definitely not a big deterrent/downside."
"Very good support team, They are really people who care about their plugin and user experience. Thank you!"
This app is really useful to set cookie bar easily.  The interface is intuitive and the personalization of the appareance is great
Simple easy to use product. Good User Interface and Experience. Prompt and responsive customer support!
Best way to remind the buyer to finish the purchase. Excellent application! Highly recommend! Very easy to use and easy to understand interface
This application is great! We used this app for our customer to select the local delivery date and time. It's simple and easy to understand. Love the interface of their user's view in app too. It makes it really easy to edit the options and update the details as required. Great app!
"Truly useful. This is the only app that lets the merchant specify/limit the delivery date and time slots. It is not a one-trick pony like many other apps which I have tried and most importantly the backend interface is reasonably easy to understand and configure. Customer support has been prompt and excellent so far. . In addition, there are extra features which you can subscribe to at a reasonable price. Support has been very good."
Easy and Intuitive interface - Used it for the first time and it was easy breezy. Really loved the flow and options that it offers
"We use this app for anything for new releases to flash sales and promotions. Customer service is extremely helpful and the user interface is well designed, making it super easy to send and schedule push notifications."
"Klaviyo's user interface is easy to use, which is a refreshing change from other web-based systems. And I especially love their pre-fabricated flows."
"essential application to be in order at the legislative level! intuitive interface, nothing to say!"
It is a good app with easy to navigate user interface. The color options are important to adapt it into the website.
"If you are an E-Commerce you should use this app. I was using Mailchimp, they are great but their interface is a little old and robust. Klaviyo works better for me, easier"
I used this app to help me out on the cookie bar consent. Hope it helps to improve my website and my customer user experience.
"I've used Consistent Cart for multiple stores on Shopify, and I absolutely love it. One of my problems with apps, is that they don't provide an easily understandable user interface, but Consistent Cart delivers successfully. Plus, they have excellent customer support."
"Useless app I have ever seen on Shopify App store. After installing this app on the store, user cannot proceed from cart page to checkout page. It writes unnecessary codes on your store which messes the entire user experience. Don't download this, if u use u will not get orders. Because user cannot proceed from cart page to checkout page. Useless and brainless people"
"Great app with a very clean interface. My only issues are that it's a bit confusing to locate and edit lists/segments. Also, for some reason it makes me log into the app every time I open it, even when I'm using the same computer/browser. All in all, it's a very good app and I'd recommend it to most people."
"We've been using this app for half a year now. It's very flexible, there is an option for almost anything you can imagine! The interface is a bit tricky to navigate though. Thankfully the Searchanise support is always quick and ready to help, just ask them a question."
This app has been great at allowing us to create a better user experience for our customers. It's easy to use and the team at Searchanise are quick to respond and help whenever it's needed.
"Easy to use, fast interface and offers a awesome range of features even on the free plan! Highly recommend for all business types!"
"Beautiful interface, but needed some help to get the whole system working properly. John helped me through the errors and set up the entire workflow for me. Give this app a shot if you require your Shopify site to have credits & rewards working!"
"Wasted hours of my day setting up my account and lists, only to find that there is no way to really remove subscribers or view/filter your subscribers (only the most recent 50?? WHY?). I had over a thousand ""subscribers"" from my website opt in form that were spam and I wanted to delete them but couldn't. You can only delete one person at a time, and only by searching their email address. I guess that's to be expected for a service where you pay per subscriber. Infuriatingly non-intuitive and cluttered interface. Find another service."
"I like the way this app streamlines both gift cards and store credit. Very nice interface and great customization. The only reason not a 5 star is it took a while troubleshooting an issue with a workflow set up after I explained it several times. It does punch cards but not per item, only per order which doesn't suit my needs. However Sam & Mark from CS fixed a billing issue (which was my fault) very quickly and on the weekend! So 5+ stars on that :) Update: So my needed feature has been added to the 90 day product road map sweet! I'm updating my review to 5 stars based on this. Will keep you posted if it rolls out as stated."
"I got a bit flummoxed when I first began working with the Rise GiftCard interface...and time was short with Christmas days away. Thankfully, Rise has great support and I was able to set up a google meeting and share screens. Dana was very helpful in getting me going including a small modification to my theme coding to adjust checkout buttons. I had a subsequent meeting with Dana to solidify my understanding and I'm all set! Great knowing the team at Rise is there if I need them. They have been very responsive! Thank you Dana!!"
"Why did you replace an important app with something that doesn't service worldwide? Are you indirectly asking us to stop using your softwares?
I spoke t o one of the developers of this app and came to know that this app doesn't support INR currency and hence we can't use this app. The other alternative is to use DYMO app but it has the most complicated interface. We can''t even export barcode labels like before. Extremely disappointed with Shopify.
Old Review (December 2018)
I started using this app since the barcode printer app started flashing that's its gonna get removed in March 2019. Its not picking the price of the product. Everything else gets printed but M.R.P. is not getting printed. We entered both Price and compare price to test but nothing gets printed in price field. Please help."
Great campaign flow interface and integrates well with Shopify. Support is pretty decent. Would recommend.
"Absolutely love this app, by far it's the best on Shopify when it comes to gift cards. The user experience is great and it is very easy to set-up. Also the people of support are just fantastic! fast response to any possible question!"
very smooth user interface. best email marketing app with so much customisation and options.Defiantly recommended
We use this app for our Gift Card and it is unlike any other! The user experience is awesome and the Rise.ai team is always available for any assistance and respond quickly. Looking forward to setting up the Referral program.
Very nice just installed on our shop and love the interface. We are very happy to use this app  https://scandinaviandesigns.net/
"Klaviyo is AMAZING! I was previously using Mail Chimp, but I love Klaviyo because I can collect as many different ""custom properties"" as I want and then use them to trigger different email flows. I can collect users' favorite color and then embed the answer in an email dynamically. I also use the feature to show content to users based on their activity. For example, I can show a special coupon to returning customer but not to new people. It's really robust and gives you infinite options. The user interface is straightforward and there is lots of great tutorials online. I would recommend this over any other email platform!"
"10/16/2018 > Great idea for an app, currently testing the app, the interface looks simple, the results matching Google Analytics which is great but with better and user friendly interface, outstanding customer and technical support from Bradley.
11/21/2018 > This App is beyond great, the live views, chat, recordings, polls, co-browsing, and Heatmaps, I used it all, I am able to customize customer behavior and adding tags and alerts based on the customer experience, I was able to know what cause the customer to bounce after reaching a certain page like 404 page not found, I was also able to teach the customers how to use how to use the website correctly ( Like hover on images to zoom ) with an interactive questions using the polls, planning to use exit intent poll next to show a customer that added an item to the cart and plans to leave the website a coupon code."
"On my hunt for the right loyalty and gift card program, there were two key things I was looking for:
1. Simple customer interface 2. Simple business set up
‘Simple’ it certainly is, yet Rise is also sophisticated. You can completely customize how, when, and why you reward your customers, you can send reminders for unused credit, you can activate a referrals program, and you can also issue a credit instead of refunds. The results? So far, they’ve been great! The loyalty perks I’ve set up are so good that it makes me want to buy my own products!
The video tutorials and customer support team have also been helpful. Highly recommend."
"the interface isn't the prettiest but it does its job perfectly. recommend, recommend, recommend...."
"I switched from MailChimp to Klaviyo and it's been a great decision. The interface is easy to use, I can easily segment audiences and create campaigns with just a few clicks."
So amazing. I've used tools many years ago that tried to do something similar (clicktale) but I think they've gotten the user interface really close to perfect. Big fan of this-- gives you perfect visibility of what your customers are running into when they have problems/confusions/etc.
"Absolutely love this app, by far it's the best on Shopify when it comes to gift cards. The user experience is great and it is very easy to set-up. When Covid hit, they were the first to help small businesses allowing to sell gift gards on FB and Instagram at no extra charge.
The customer service is amazing, they reply within minutes every time I had a question and Nadav is fantastic.
I highly recommend this app and I have been with Shopify for 4 years and had lots of trial and error with apps, this is a keeper."
Easy to install. Great user interface all at a fair price. Interested to see how my experience develops.
Rise.ai helped us in overcoming the giftcard issue related to VAT in Europe. Nadav offers great support and is quick in responding for anything you need. The app itself we will use across all our stores and the user experience is amazing. Looking forward to seeing the results and further improve our store
"Love that it's free, and does everything I need it to. Captures reviews right in the product page interface. Thanks for great value!"
"excellent app interface. The best out there, to be honest, I was looking for a way to make my store more trustful for customers since I had several abandoned cars and this app definitely changed that."
"Great solution for adding social proof to your product pages. Easy to use interface. Once you get it set up, which doesn't take long. It runs by itself and gets tons of reviews."
Very useful but not without it's limitations. I would love the ability to have customers upload photos of their purchases. It would also be great (since this is a Shopify-owned app) to have it integrated with the purchasing process. Allow for a follow up email so customers can leave feedback on their purchase without having to find the correct item on the website. as it stands there are too many steps and barriers to access that allow for a more streamlined and conversion-friendly user experience.
Great App works well! User Interface is simple and easy to use. Excellent customer Support! Quick Response time.
"I used this app for almost two years during which time it was getting worse and less competitive all the time. 
Pros:
Good print quality
Easy to use interface
Fairly good selection of products
Cons:
Arbitrary and incoherent content policy
Inconsistent and often slow turnaround times (even before Covid-19)
Slow and mostly unhelpful customer service
They are among the most expensive pod platforms"
"Great app from the experience so far, I have not launched the site yet but it appears to have a clean interface that would encourage customers to buy more"
"Good app, nice interface, would recommend fully"
"Better app than others in the market this app, increases the sells in my online store and facilitates de user experience"
Easy to use app. The interface is simple yet very effective. Definitely a recommended app! Happy to use it!
Growave gave us the opportunity to activate a complete package of features for fidelity cards on our site. The interface is intuitive and assistance is always friendly and helpful!
so far I love what I see I really appreciate the layout design and feel of the interface.
I am using the free plan of this app. So far it works well. I had no problem installing this app. The user interface is simple and easy to understand.
Great app with an increasingly improving interface and support. I use it for shopify and etsy and find it cheaper and more user friendly for my order quantity.
"I've this app for a while now. It has great interface, great mockups, and great customer support. I recomand it."
"Great app for creating upsell/cross sell opportunities into your store, excellent interface, analytics, overall UX is incredible compared to many other upsell apps available. Ryanna from support is excellent! Would definitely recommend checking this app out!"
This is the easiest way for our visitors to know we now have free shipping. The options are simple and the interface is elegant.
"We've gone through a few up-sell apps in the past. Each not meeting our full expectations. LimeSpot so far has been what we've been looking for because of these reasons:
• user friendly interface
• outstanding customer support (some of the best I've encountered with a Shopify app)
• fits seamlessly with the look and feel of our website
• easy to setup
• increases revenue
One area I'd like to see improvements on is visibility in their reporting. We'd like to have visibility to attribution on the order level. We feel this is especially important as it determines the fees collected for their service."
Great app! Easy to use! Simple interface. One of the best free or paid apps to use for sales notifications.
"Shappify offers just what I need --- I sell primarily to retail shops, but also want to sell directly to consumers.  I prefer to have the wholesale pricing for retailers private, but still offer a quick and easy-to-access interface for them to use within my current site.  Bingo.  No more downloading forms and faxing orders, no second website, no special retailer portal....Consumer Pricing integrates my wholesale pricing seamlessly into my Shopify site, revealing the wholesale pricing only to people that I specify.
And it is absolutely perfect.  The ways I can customize my pricing tiers and which products it applies to and which visitors get what is fabulous, simple to set up, and gets me thinking of all the ways I can play with it in the future (discount incentives to loyal customers, different levels of wholesale pricing, bogos, bulk discounts, etc.).
As with everyone else that's commented, I found the folks over at Shappify really helpful.  They worked with me to install the app to get me up and running without delay.  I also have their locator map app, and just love it, too.  I can't wait to see what they come up with next.....
Huge smiley face to Shappify."
"In the midst of playing around with the platform, so far so good and interface looks really nice! Leo has been really helpful! Tops customer service! 5 stars!!"
"Wonderful App! Easy to use and customize. We've been using it for a little while and noticed some growing pains. We see that they are really working hard at getting the app working faster, more stable and at simplifying and streamlining the user interface. Great job! Keep up the great work!
Customer support is a real pleasure! We've had the support team work on refining our custom user interface. They were able to customize the layout, colors, font sizes and they even added a small ""CA"" in front of the ""$"" to show what currency we are using on our store, by adding custom code for us. The modifications were done promptly and courteously. What a charm!
We really enjoy this app for what it does at recommending targeted products to our clients depending on what they look at and the way they surf around our store. The best feature we continuously use is the Analytics Section! It gives us great insight on which products are trending and popular. It also allows us to help shift our focus more in the direction of what's working or not.
We are very happy with the results! 
Thank you LimeSpot!

"I do POD and have tried several POD apps searching for one to do most of my business with. I like Printify's prices, and their customer services is fantastic in my experience. I love that the Printify interface keeps track of the products you create with editing ability, where other apps do not track your products in any way. Printify has become my go-to POD provider and I'm very happy with them."
"Apr. 2020 (updated review) 2 STARS
Printify needs more USA production partners. When something goes wrong, there are essentially 3 partners in the USA total to juggle your order, or just have it cancelled after waiting almost a month. 
I can't run a growing business like this. Use printify if you are a startup and want cheaper pricing and a hit and miss on quality. If you have more than a few orders per day, you may have to go through the 3rd party nightmare printify has become, being told day after day, week after week, your tee is going to be made, only to have it even more late or cancelled.
I have proven to printify how I can get any color within a day or so for any order. Yet their production partners can't get it for weeks!? 
If printify adds 5 to 10 more production partners in the USA, I'll come back. Otherwise I feel forced, after sending them thousands of orders per month,  to find another solution as I am finding 95% of my negative reviews come from PRINTIFY orders vs the orders I do locally with the plentiful printing companies for both DTG and SCREEN.
PRINTIFY knows what they need to do, I've given them a year of thousands of orders per month, and although COVID-19 hasn't helped, it makes it 100 times worse as I realized they don't have enough production partners to help offset issues. 
Their software is improving, but i can't tell you how many times I've told them their support ticket system is the worse by far. They have amazing support team, but the way it's setup is very counter intuitive, disconnected from any flow to the orders involved. 
PROS
Affordable. Cool setup. Awesome backup process if one partners fails your order, another can cover (if it exists). Awesome staff. Forward thinking CEO and company.
CONS
Affordable (quality issues). Backup process (literally your business is in the hands of two large-ish companies and one smaller one, so if they fail, you are doomed). Awesome staff (who will just give you the same answer again and again). Ticket system is very frustrating as it's not connected to orders, you can't search tickets (unless you are tech savvy and know how to search your own emails), orders are not linked to tickets, but it's all copy and paste manual work. 
Jan. 2020. (updated review) 3 STARS
Printify is pushing for being the best. I appreciate their efforts. Biggest problem is knowing if your order will actually be fulfilled on whatever colors the POD vendors run out of. There is NO WAY so far to tell what will be out of stock. 
PRINTIFY knows what they need to fix, we'll see how they do this year.
Printify is worth your time and money, but do not depend on them if you have higher numbers of orders and they end up telling you their print partner ran out of stock and CANCELLED (did you read that? Cancelled) your orders after waiting for two entire weeks. Very unprofessional, must be changed. 
Printify is the best POD 3rd party software out there for the price. Printful is better, but you'll spend thousands more with them. I'm using a mix of both now, per Printify not being able to fix the issues of stock shortages and orders sometimes an entire MONTH with no update, status, or anything, until we get an angry customer. 
POD SHOUD be auto fulfilment, but so far, I'm spending more time than needed to figure out which orders Printify and their production partners just simply put off for good.
-------------------------------------------------
Oct. 28 2019 (updated review)
See my initial hopeful, thorough reviews below this one. 
Printify uses production partners and shows an average production time for each production partner. This production time is not accurate. Sometimes off by weeks! 
We have seen maybe 85% of our orders shipped within 7 days or less. But good luck with the other 15%. If we had not been spending (wasting is a better word) so much time reaching out to PRINTIFY through their very useless ticketing system (see review below) who then reaches out to the printing partner, again and again, we would have not even known why in the world, some orders were 20 to 24 days late and counting! 
We got the same answer again and again from printify staff. Stock shortage. Will reach out to partner. 
I did tests myself and found the same colors were in stock, readily available and we had it shipped to us and out to customers within 3 business days, whereas we are still waiting for a week and a half and nothing has moved on hundreds of our orders - suggesting other issues outside stock shortage.
The holiday is here already, and now Printify is refusing to refund us for these super late orders, they promised us their printing production partner would have out in time for the holiday. 
Unprofessional. Damage control is no fun. The brand image hurt. Customers disappointed and infuriated.
I hope this will get PRINTIFY's attention. If they resolve these orders with full refunds, I'll remove this review and keep it removed unless PRINTIFY continues to show they are unwilling to help us for bringing thousands of monthly orders through their app. when they promise something and their printing partner fails us repeatedly.
-------------------------------------------------
Oct. 2019. (updated review) 
With a few thousands of orders now pushed through PRINTIFY app, I can now see where they shine and fail. I write this so others know what to expect and not expect and beware of as well as enjoy. I'm downgrading my review from a 5 star down to a 3 star, hopefully, to raise it up again when some key issues are fixed ASAP, if not I'll downgrade in a few months to a 2 star - as these issues can literally break your brand reputation and customer trust.
I hope to update this review as I go forward to give PRINTIFY and their PARTNERS a chance to wow us. 
PROS:
- CUSTOMER SERVICES:
Printify staff isn't in some remote garage. They are a legit company, who cares about your experience using their platform and production partners.
- TICKET SYSTEM:
Also a HUGE CON, but the pro side of their ticket system is it is more than just a couple of people - and they do respond to every issue.
- UI (user interface):
Although it is lacking in functionality, their interface is not clunky or difficult, but fluidly designed (this coming from a UI designer for a decade himself)
- POTENTIAL FULFILMENT TIME:
This is huge for us, and what attracted us to PRINTIFY amongst other things. This also has a HUGE CON i explain below until PRINTIFY enahnces their app.
- POST PRODUCTION ISSUES
They have a smooth ""submit issue"" link you can use, setup beautifully for any post shipmpent and production issue. This is awesome, but boy oh boy do they need to tie it to the details page of an order ID.
CONS:
- LOCATION & TIMEZONE: 
Although staffed well, it could be a con that the company is in Europe. Time zone conflicts are an issue. This can also be a potential PRO, in that you almost have a 24 hour business - but you have to time things right and it looks like they have staff to cover the off hours you are awake and they are asleep (depending on where you live & where print partner is located, I'm in Utah, USA).
- TICKET SYSTEM:
This is a huge con. When you have an issue with an order, you have NO WAY OF KNOWING what is going on with your order and the POD parter making it, as there is no notes tied to any order details. You have to manually go find whoever responded to you, (there is absolutely no search function with tickets, a HUGE TIME WASTER). We have had multiple orders now, go for over 20 freaking (yes, I said freaking) days, without a single reason as to why, only to find out on some orders, after another 4 days passes, that there was a stock issue???? 
PRINTIFY must change their ticket system to tie with orders, otherwise it's just a huge waste of time for customers, POD partners, and esp. printify, as numerous tickets have to be submitted so as to not lose time trying to find the last response, by manually scrolling and guessing which rep answered you. 
- ORDER ISSUES:
To tie in with the ticket system issues, if you have an issue with a live order (not shipped yet), and even if that issues is resolved and the order finally shipped, there is no notes on the order details, and the tracking info is never updated to the order details page, so the only way to figure out what happened to that order and get tracking is to search your email, to find that order and tracking, as good luck searching for tickets, it's impossible, you have scroll and guess who it was that resolved the issue.
- STOCK ISSUES
There is absolutely NO WAY to know if the colors available with some POD partners are in stock or not. You will find out mind you, but this will be 20+ days after the order was submitted, with an update you had to ask for, that something was out of stock.
- REPORTS and STATS
Printify has Zero information with a paid subscription to let us know how we are doing. We have no idea using PRINTIFY:
1. How many tees we have sold?
2. Avg. ship time with each POD partner?
3. Our avg. cost per unit for each POD partner?
4. Actual total costs, showing both shipping and POD costs?
5. stats for the day, week, month, previous 90 days?
6. actual savings we are getting for the volume we are brining. They talk about it on their site, but I have no idea at the end of the day or month, what I'm spending and discounts or savings I'm receiving through using PRINTIFY and pushing my business through their app. 
SUMMARY:
I love what I'm seeing with PRINTIFY. I love the innovative feel I've gotten as I've tried to figure out how PRINTIFY company works in our behalf. They have a great staff, team, and seem to be pushing for new updates quickly (a must or they will lose our business not because we leave, but because their system is not helping with the most important, shouldn't be this hard, order issues). 
I'd give them a 2 star at this point, just for the sake of the headaches of their ticket system and having ZERO updates by them on orders that have sat for 24 days, when I've asked for updates a few times on those orders. Printify is a middle man, that does well, but to have to wait 20+ days on some orders without updates, when a simple phone call to the POD partner could have solved it, screams for PRINTIFY to improve their ticket system so we can communicate, see, and easily access all notes on the order details page, rather than the nightmare it is right now.
IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS:
- PRINTIFY must update their ticket system so that it integrates smoothly with the order details page. Connect all notes to the details page.
- PRINTIFY needs to have a way for customers to communicate with the POD partners, through the order details notes area.
- PRINTIFY must kill this difficult manual scrolling and guessing game with their ticket system, to try and find what a rep said about some orders, because the notes are nowhere on the order details page itself, but lost somewhere in the completely separate support ticket chat / systems. 
- PRINTIFY must integrate a stock update functionality. You have no clue if the colors you have are in stock. PRINTFUL has a way to choose a backup solution where stock is low, and they actually let you know what's out of stock, discontinued, etc. 
- REPORTING
We need to see what's going on, how many sales with each POD, total costs of shipping (nowhere does it show you this that I can find) and reporting on fulfilment time averages, number of tees sold, colors, etc. Make me believe I need PRINTIFY as a middle man, by providing me the data that will make me never leave PRINTIFY for. Why am I paying a monthly fee and who knows what other fees, for ZERO stats, data, and insights to what we are bringing through PRITNIFY app.

Sept 2019. 4 STARS
 I'm coming at Printify after years of using other apps. There is a reason I'm switching to Printify, and will update my review as time goes by. Printify's UI (user interface) is hands down super fluid, user-friendly, and amazing compared to the others I've used. 
I absolutely am finding a safe place with their app, coming from the failed experiences of other apps, costing our graphic apparel business thousands and potential tens of thousands of lost customers due to inconsistency, bugs, software issues, and lack of quality control and ownership of problems.
So far so good. Choose your partner wisely on this app, and you will be happy.
will update in a month or so. But as of yet, this app and company has done it right, and our business looks and flows more smoothly since transitioning over to Printify from other POD apps."
"Absolutely Fantastic! Very easy to navigate and use, friendly interface, I don't think I could use any other app."
"At first glance it may seem little tricky but  once you get used to the interface it works a charm, with the added customer service experience makes this one a must have upsell app. highly recommended."
"Very good user experience and easy to implement, flexible settings and a good incentive for customers. Great app!"
"Just started with this app.  Great user experience, I'm all set up in under an hour.  Such a fun way to collect emails as well as influence conversion."
This app is awesome! Great interface and very easy to implement. It definitely helped in our email marketing efforts by increasing email capture rates through the addition of a gamification element.
"I was researching a bunch of loyalty programs and once I have stumbled upon Smile there was no need to look anywhere else. The interface is so user-friendly that even a child could set up a loyalty program. The fact that we are able to use some of the most important features of the Smile for free is just superb because lots of people who get into e-commerce are on tight budgets. Once one's brand starts growing, the additional features from the paid plan are just top-notch because Smile can bring a lot of lifetime value to your business! Oh, and have I mentioned the customer service? A M A Z I N G !
Got my problems resolved in a matter of minutes! With all of this being said, if you're considering Smile, stop considering and take action, you won't regret it!"
The app is very easy to use and quick to set up. The user interface looks clean and crisp. Very impressed.
"Awesome app! These are the exact features we were looking for. Our customers love to bundle and shopify falls a bit short with discounts, buy 1 get x and bundles. This app solves the bundling dilemma with ease. Beautiful easy to understand interface and it only takes a few minutes to but together and awesome bundle."
Easy user experience and great customer service! Cannot wait to see the results over the long terms!
Fantastic user interface. I love using this app it has increased my conversion rate. This app is a must-have for Shopify store owners.
I really liked the app. Very simple to use and great user experience. It is definitely better than the traditional pop-ups. Recommended.
great app love it dont ever remove it i love the interface of the app and all the features involved
Clean interface and easy to set up. Quite customisable and support has been good so far. I've been using this app for a week now.
"Simply awesome!!!!
Easy and quickly way to compose Newsletter and capture potential customers. Fantastic interface and great features.
This is an essential tool for every online business."
"The No.1 Fidelity Program existing on Shopify APP Store! I don't say this just because of that but I did research and tried lots of apps but none of them are like this one. Very intuitive interface! The staff is Amazing, especially Andrea!"
I have been using the app for about three days so far the interface is good and customer service is quite responsive. So far my conversion rate is climbing so I look forward to seeing what the app can really do.
Added this app to my shop and my clients have already started having fun using it. The interface is extremely easy to use and I highly recommend it :)
"Best user experience and even better customer support. totally recommend it, even with the free plan :)"
Fantastic app. My favourite email collection and conversion app on Shopify. Great user experience for both users and for back end configuration.
"Exactly what we needed! really easy to use interface and makes it really easy to up-sell! 
The install is a little tough so we paid the $25 to have it put in for us, which is worth it for us"
"Bold’s product bundling app is very well thought through from a usability standpoint.  We were impressed by how easily product bundles could be configured, however the app does not interface with our QuickBooks/Qstock inventory management systems so ultimately we were unable to utilize the app.  In the future, if Bold were to make this app compatible with inventory management systems we would reinstall it in a heartbeat."
"Awesome customer service! They go the extra length to explain to my inquiries. The backend interface is built by professionals. Very easy to setup, like 10mins then you are set to go. Unless you want more features. The user interface, hmm simple, but can be confusing for first time user though, hope there's a tutorial button at the side to explain the feature. And i prefer a page instead of side bubble."
"Great app! A must have for every story! We really love the card game, great interface and easy setup."
"UPDATED Review:
Customer support reached out after my first review and were very helpful. More customers can find the app now and we are gaining some traction. I do hope that the pricing is reduced in future or more features are added to be more competitive with other review apps. Thus, justifying the price on the low range. But it is a really nice app with an excellent interface. It would be great to get weekly emails regarding signups etc as a feature."
"Smile has been a great addition to our business. The team are helpful, and the functionality far exceeds other offerings on the market. The user interface and ability to launch quickly is a great feature."
"Would give this app 10 stars if I could. Here's why:
1. I noted that it wasn't available on my theme, and they made it ready for me in less than 2 days. I hadn't purchased a thing before they went in and did this.
2. SIMPLE. The setup was quick and painless. Attach first image to each color variant, and the rest just fall in line. Brilliant. No having to go work in an app interface and edit listings in 2 different places (one of the other image variant apps will require this).
3. Shashank provided quick, thorough, and over the top customer support.
4. Does what it says. Works flawlessly. Sets up in seconds.
5. Lands on first variant, rather than showing all images. Super clean. Literally wouldn't change a thing about it.
YOU'RE GONNA WANT THIS APP."
Nice interface and easy to use. With so many options there is something for everybody. Would recommend if you are using MailChimp.
Easy interface with both Shopify and Amazon.  Best of all is their tech support.  As a newcomer to online selling OrderCup customer service has been a lifesaver.
"Amazing. Great interface (for both the seller and customers), customisable and their Support team is quick to reply."
I used this app to create my first pop in ad to grow my email list.  The interface is easy to use and the options are great.  I would highly recommend.
"I've been using OrderCup for some time and it'a a great system.
It has it's ups and downs, but as a whole I would definitely recommend it to anyone.  When reading the comments below there is a lot of misinformation, especially regarding the mac platform.
Here is what you should know:
OC works just fine with a mac, but it requires extra setup.  You'll need to follow the instructions in the support section for setting up CUPS printing if you have a Thermal printer.  You WILL need the latest version of Java from Oracle.  
The only DPI supported is 203.  So don't buy a fancy thermal printer unless it uses 203dpi resolution.  Your shipping labels will print but they will be small, and packing lists will not work at all.
OC has good rates and great customer service.  There are times they can be a bit slow to respond, but I think that has more to do with them taking their time to investigate the issue.
The interface DOES allow you to ship random items.  You just create a new order, fill out the customer details and ship.
As a whole, I give OC a thumbs up.  It continues to improve and will only get better with time."
"This is the only app that solved my eBay integration needs! 
I was in need of importing 3,000 products from my eBay store into Shopify. Every app on the Shopify store only allowed me to import through their 3rd party channel, and from there individually/manually upload EVERY item into shopify. This was extremely time consuming and the alternative CSV file method was just as time consuming to add image links.
This app instantly imported my products into their interface. From there you can bulk select the products for import into Shopify. Integration literally took me 10 minutes. The biggest plus to using this app was it mirrored my eBay store categories. Other apps will integrate in, but only categorize your products by eBay listing categories, ultimately leaving you with a sloppy website. Lastly, the customer service is exceptional. I received a response within minutes and my concerns were remedied promptly.
This is a great app and I highly recommend it!"
"While Ordercup's support staff is very nice and genuinely want to help you (although I didn't appreciate the phone calls asking me to give a better review than the one I left a previously) - I'm afraid the program just leaves too much to be desired for me. The user interface is pretty bad. It would be ok if this were the 15 years ago, but compared to most any other program it seems rudimentary. They really should invest in UI design. Granted, some people don't care if the site looks nice, just as long as it works. It does work, mostly, but it's not at all intuitive. It's hard to figure out where settings and options are and I feel like I spend too much time bumbling around looking for things. Their competition won me over because of cost and a MUCH better user experience.
Sorry Ordercup, you just aren't a good fit for me. But based on other reviews, it seems you have plenty other satisfied users. Good luck to you."
"The App works wonderfully. User Interface, excellent. Speed and responsiveness, excellent. All of the features you would want in a chat service both desktop and mobile are here.
LenoreBatherie.com"
"Best live chat app for Shopify. They allow you to use the app for free with all of their features, unlike other apps that limit chats, or make a very obtrusive interface for the customers. This app is amazing! Plus, the new upgrades are awesome. I am looking forward to the long term use of this app."
"We're still in our trial period but we are LOVING Order Cup. Shipping, both domestic and to Canada, have been a breeze and I'm very pleased with the workflow interface. 
Great job!"
"I have been working with Shopify and consequently OrderCup for about 3 years.  Both companies are great, but I want to highlight the benefits that OrderCup has over practically everyone else on the market.  Their product works....across multiple platforms....Chrome or Firefox, OrderCup doesn't care, they'll print on two printers or more from either.
With OrderCup, you feel like they are making the connection from your store to the Shipping Companies directly.  I can ship on my USPS account or UPS account.  At will and even change from order to order.  Brilliant connection for a small business to grow.
You may think that their interface is slightly dated, but that just proves that they are class A Geeks that can get it done, despite the makeup and lipstick.
Use them to ship, or you are just doing it wrong.

Used across multiple platforms and business websites to facilitate my marketing campaigns. Easy to use and very helpful user interface overall.
These guys are Awesome! Their support is one of the best I've ever come across. Intuitive and easy to use interface. Shipping will be a breeze with Ordercup. This will save me lot of time.
this is incredible value .. FREE ?! wt! such an advance app and interface dashboard and plenty of widgets to custom your own look .. an iphone app too for 24/7 custom support... you'd seriously be crazy not to instal this .. I'm gonna use this to its max.. triggers/behaviours. analytics.. this is super geekness at its best for $0000.00 pm !
User friendly interface. Excellent attention to detail. The app does exactly what it says it will do. Try it out!
It took me a minute to get used to the interface but the customer support has been excellent. I switched over from Endicia and have been very happy with the way OrderCup works with Shopify. From my order I click the 'ship with OrderCup' button and it takes me right to the USPS details. Once finished OrderCup attaches the tracking info to the order and closes it. Simple and efficient !!!
"Frustrated would be an understatement. It just doesn't work and the user interface is not intuitive at all. I got lost trying to make this work for the first 5 days my shop was open. After several conversations with the tech support, it still wouldn't work. It's simple: I want to print 3-5 UPS labels a day, that's it. Can't do it with this program which is trying to be more than it needs to be. I'm headed to PayPal to print my shipping labels."
"Really wish this app would be more intuitive and better organized.  The user experience leaves much to be desired, it's extremely not user-friendly.  Also no phone support."
"Really useful app for our sub-brands, easy to use and simple interface. Highly recommend for small businesses"
"This Google Shopping Feed n Actions app has been the best application for Google I have encountered so far! It was a pretty straightforward and seamless process. Most of the details related to product, order and shipment are synced and managed through the platform, which streamlines all of my business needs.
The app is very detailed, with many quality features that offer great compatibility with Shopify. My Shopify listings all went into Google Merchant Center in no time! The team who helped me setup Shopping Actions were very responsive and thorough, providing us with all the necessary skills to help me get more sales. They have developed an amazing realtime app that's definitely worth every penny! Along with amazing user experience and customer support. I totally recommend it!"
App is supper.  Excellent. Easy and convenient interface. I recommend to everyone Bulk Image Edit ‑ Image SEO.
"Easy to use, user friendly, support team is very cooperative. user interface is very attractive and easy to use."
great stuff! Enjoyed the interface and easy to use. Wish there was a way to add a background photo in the pop-up
Fantastic integration with my Kit Skills. Easy to use interface that produces wonderful reports to track abandoned carts and tools to re-target those customers! Glad I found a great tool such as Kit Karts.
"It was a great transition using this app to build our email campaigns and the interface is great! It's affordable and user friendly, they have decent customer service as well."
User friendly interface and very helpful customer service. I am still on the free version because I only have 50 skus.  Once I have everything setup and ready to go I will see if the monthly subscription is worth it.
"This app is the most useful Google product that I have come across over the years. The app has excellent interface and prominent features that I got to know as I used it more n more. It covers everything related to making profiles, well timed syncing of products, inventory ,price and most other product data from my Shopify to Googlr, and orders vice-versa.
Another good this is that it covers both Google Shopping Actions and Google ads, and their prices are best!
You should not be skeptical, because the results this app gave me is the true value for money!
They have also covered the merchant center data for you to have a look at so that you can view it in the app itself. The tracking info of shipped products is also updated to Google merchant center. It makes it easy to check the currently pending issues if any, and acts as a nice reminder to fix them. Just a single click after install, and merchant center data can be imported in the app easily. Perfect!
The service team for my app has been the best till date! I am happy to mention Amit and Mirza for their excellent efforts towards my google work. Thank you for taking time for setting up my Shopping Actionsand guiding me through all of it.
I have had an excellent experience with this Google app team! They never let me down! I highly recommend this Google app from CedComemerce!"
User friendly interface. Very simple to use and the app does exactly what it says it will do to optimize your store.
"mailchimp is great,very subtle and straight forward interface. how do i log into mailchunk? where can one register for it?"
"Great Team and App. They take the time to explain things to you if there is any confusion on your part and help you to get set up right if there are any issues with the feed, as well as, willing to do custom work if you need that. Additionally, if there is ever an issue on their side and you bring it to their attention they will investigate quickly and let you know what went wrong and make the effort to resolve it fast.
The app also has a very clean and user-friendly interface and depending on your experience with feeds may have a slight learning curve if you have to do custom product mappings. However, if you need help they are very quick to respond and help...so don't hesitate to reach out to them.
They also provide additional Google Marketing services for an additional fee if you need it, which is an added bonus.
Although our business relationship is still new, based on my experience so far with the team...we look forward to working with them long term as our business needs grow. 
Will provide additional insights and updates later as things progress or if anything changes drastically. Thanks again."
"A nice product and among the best ones out there for managing Google listings. This app has everything that you would need for a complete online sale business. Perfect syncing of price, inventory, orders, shipments. It has a well built interface and easy to understand features.
Top class app and service. This team is really wonderful and they helped me sort out all my account issues and helped learn about Google Shopping. They also guided well for sorting out issues on my website. A must have app for Shopify Store."
"i like the graphical interface 
it's easy to use and has some interseting options 
this the first time i'm using this app so that's all i can say
thank u"
"Thank you for letting us use it for free. This is a very great app. Very easy to use. Also has saved us a lot of time to customize. This app basically does all for us. Loading time is acceptable as well. Highly recommend whoever wants to give a try. This app won't waste your time but save yours!
P.S.
We believe this app will start to charge later. Like if we want to remove the ""Insta Shop by Snapppt"", we'll have to pay.
It's fine to start billing, but if there's anyone can design something like, ""Your store has converted one purchase by using this app, if you'd like to convert more, subscribe to other plans."" Then that would be more than awesome.
(Cuz whether to invest an app or not is always a big decision to make for a small business. So if a small business can pay after converting a purchase, then that's really helpful.)
UPDATE:
The developer & his team (if there is one) of this app seeks for bugs very actively and care about users' experience very much. They just fixed one bug we found. Very appreciate it. You can be sure this app is supported by people who care about user experience very much. Highly recommend!"
"Amazing app at an unbeatable price. Really gives you a LOT of control over shopping campaign refinements. This has really helped lower our CPC and increased our CTR. Also, the customer support is great, particularly SWATI LOHANI who always responds quickly with clear answers or direct action if needed. Highly recommended.
After much research looking for a Shopping Feed App, I decided on this one, after reading lots of positive reviews. This is a very good app at an affordable price. The support team has been fantastic. Any issues or questions I had were dealt with quickly, efficiently and professionally. Well done guys!
Really easy to set up and a nice interface. I have used other Shopping feed apps before and felt that it was easier to get started with this one. It even has a button to add conversion tracking ( tried to do this manually before and it was a HUGE headache to figure out by myself
After trying almost every app for shopping feeds this app absolutely is the best, I didn't receive errors from Shopping channels like all other apps all products were published without errors to fix which takes hours of work I ran campaigns 24 hours after installed this app. 
This app is a lifesaver! I was running 2 different Google Shopping campaigns, 1 is search campaign and another one is standard shopping campaign . Despite my best efforts of adjusting bids and such, I had 0 impressions on my ads for weeks. I spoke with a ""specialist"" at Google who gave me nothing but vague, unhelpful information. I was hesitant to pay for this app, but within a few days of installing it, I'm now getting impressions on my ads left and right. Not gonna lie, I'm new to this whole Google Merchant center nonsense and I don't have the time or patience to learn. This app fixed whatever I failed to do, or messed up on while uploading my product feed on my own and it's definitely worth the money. Definitely a must have for people who are new to Google Shopping like myself."
"Google Express Integration app is very helpful,cedcommerce did a great job in getting my products live quickly. The support is definitely the best i have ever experienced. Special thanks to Swati Lohani, she were always responsive. I am impressed with her service, her skill level is phenomenal and works really hard. She is  available 24*7 to help and guide throughout. 
Also i would like to thank Mirza, were always there to help me right from the very first day. The CED app and its support is much better than its competitors. I would definitely recommend this app to all those who are looking to sell on Google.
Everything you need for your business on Google is in here! You sales will definitely increase and you will enjoy this app like all others. Nice pricing scheme and well designed interface with a helpful question/answer section.
Also the app provide you great advanced features like
Profiling feature in the app helped me to filter out the products and allowed to upload them with different settings & configurations.
The Product Repricer feature in the app helped me to increase and decrease my products price either with the fixed value or with a percentage. 
The app also helped me in completing every bit of step in the whole process, plus i got impeccable 24*7 support services by the team.
I highly recommend this app. Truly an awesome experience with it.

"This is the most awesome app I have ever used.  This app has unique features like custom pricing, profiling and threshold inventory.
The app is really user-friendly and the best part is their support especially Amit Dixy and Mirza Nady Beg. They are available 24*7 to help and guide throughout. They were always there to help me right from the very first day. The CED app and its support is much better than its competitors. I would definitely recommend this app to all those who are looking to sell on Google.
When I first looked for Google Express I had no idea how amazing this could be. The market and the app both are awesome. The app eased a lot of my burden and the guys helped me so much that I cannot express my gratitude in words. I was a bit confused between Google express and Google Shopping but the support team helped me and explained in details about the onboarding process. 
What amazes me most is that Google Express is new and any new website or app needs time and hard work to get built up in years, and what these people have done in such a little time is truly UNBELIEVABLE!!!
I was a little doubtful when I first started using Shopping Actions, as it is a big platform which needs understanding, but in some time I got to know that the best help is always there :)
Everything you need for your business on Google is in here! You sales will definitely increase and you will enjoy this app like all others. Nice pricing scheme and well designed interface with a helpful question/answer section.
Kudos to Google Express Integration and the people of CEDcommerce. All the best!"
"I was looking to have a fine app that could manage my listings for google. I tried many apps out there but none of them seemed to be so helpful as this Google Express Integration. This app is simply amazing. 
I installed the app with ease. The setup was detailed but easy to understand. Then came a beautiful interface and well built sections within the app, to manage the entire product and order business details. There is another feature for making profiles that allows to easily filter and configure the listings with additional attributes. Also i needed to manage my products specificially with lowered prices and the repricer feature easily helped solve that requirement. There are lot of other features that make this app wonderful!
I contacted Dixy, the guy working on the app, and he guided me in deep detail about the app and its uses. After getting help from the guy I came to know that there is so much to know and learn about Google Express, Shopping Actions, Google Shopping etc. The way the guy spoke was simply incredible and treated me so well. 
This app has everything you need to manage for Google sales. It's no doubt that this app is rated the best as its got the best workers. 
I got google sales within some time after using this app. That's superb!

I highly recommend this app. Truly an awesome experience with it.

"The Google Express integration app is very user-friendly and works great. It has got nice features like creating custom profiles, real-time management of inventory, price, and order, shipment tracking updates, fixed and threshold inventories to set specific stocks, repricing the products and many more. 
Cedcommerce team has been very helpful in guiding me for the app and managing my products for Google Express. The app also has a very smooth user interface. I also got great support for setting up my Shopping Actions account. The Ced team also designed a very nice logo for my Google Express store. 
I have had an extremely good experience with this app. The installation was also simple and brief, and the different sections in the app are also beautifully designed. I had linked the wrong merchant center while installing the app, but I was easily able to reconnect the correct merchant center from the app's accounts section!! 
To all sellers out there looking to sell on Google Express and Shopping, this is the app to choose and Cedcommerce is the company to get connected with. 10/10 stars!"
"muito bom esse aplicativo, para dar mais credibilidade para a loja, uma interface muito intuitiva de fácil."
"Very well designed solution, very intuitive user interface and fully customizable to match your site aesthentics and needs.
A big thank you to Jemuel and LOOX team for his immediate response helping me to manage my theme wherever I needed."
"For its ease of use and intuitive interface, you can't go wrong -- especially at it's free price tag! It would be awesome if the dashboard colors could be changed. Some of the constrast, (white on black/color) make it difficult to focus and just get the job done. But I'm not complaining. This app is useful and (more importantly) easy!"
"I used this and paid for a few weeks. Don't use this! There are much better options with way better pricing models. Don't use this especially if you don't have a paying customer base. They expect you to be able to fork over $30 a month even when you have 0 subscribers. That's if you want to use all the features that is. Even if you do have all the features, it is not a very intuitive interface. Long story short, just don't bother until they fix their pricing model. They should wait till you get a certain number of subscribers before you have to pay. Show you that they actually provide value to you before you pay."
"Free trial is on going, but so far so good. Easy interface to use. Thank you BIE for solving a problem a lot of eccomerce sites new help with."
Makes creating a Look Book so simple. Drag and drop and an easy interface. I tried out multiple other apps before deciding on Snapppt. Looking forward to new features!
"This app is awesome, I'm able to email a lot of potential customers easily. and it has an easy interface,"
"These guys got it right. I wanted an app where I could see the images and it was clear what was going to happen. Hextom's Bulk Image Edit did that for me. Plus, the scheduler is well done. As a web developer myself, I can say with some credibility, the interface is well done and a pleasure to work with."
Works well with my shop and is easy to use. Love the interface and how easy it is to navigate and choose which things to be included or removed from our feed.
"Great. easy and intuitive interface and had first campaign up and running in no time. I would prefer the lists would sync with my Mailchimp account, but thats really the only downside."
Clean and elegant set up and intuitive interface for customers looking to collect items!
"Snapppt is a perfect platform for connecting your Instagram following to your website. 
Interface: Clean, easy-to-use, attractive
Functions: It is quite simple to get started and they even go along with you step by step as you create your account and link your Instagram and website. Selecting and pin pointing which images to let your customers click into to buy your products is very simple and easy.
Overall, Snapppt is such an amazing app for a business that wants to grow through the advantage of social media. It took about 10 minutes to get everything set up and running and our website reach has increased since then. Definitely recommend this app and looking forward to the updates ahead!"
Nice Apps I Like It. Great user experience visitors coming back to my store and Buy Product.....Thanks.
AWESOME APP!  THESE GUYS ARE IMPROVING THE APP BY THE DAY AND ARE VERY RESPONSIVE TO QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS.  THIS APP HAS BY FAR MADE MY ROADMAP FROM INSTAGRAM LIKE TO ORDER CHECKOUT MUCH EASIER WITH INCREASING SALES!  AWESOME USER-FRIENDLY INTERFACE EVEN FROM A SMARTPHONE AND AMAZING TRACKING DATA!  GLAD I GAVE IT A TRY!
Quick way to increase the user experience on your website.  This is a great way to reduce bounce rates on your site.
"Never seen a worse interface then in this app. Any guide you find was made on the old interface. In fact, they are useless for the new interface. Furthermore, the new interface is horribly confusing and you do not find anything you need. The old interface was perfect. I saw it in youtube guides but cannot do anything because the new interface is absolute crap."
Great app overall! Is really easy to use and the interface is friendly. The import function is great. It's the price who made me offer only 4 stars instead of 5.
User friendly interface. Good results.Bulk edit is also another good feature of the product. Recommendable.
I love that the reminder messages are sent out and I don't have to keep reminding myself. The ease to intergrate into Shopify is outstanding. The interface is easy. I can't love it more.
We use this Shopify-to-eBay integration app on a daily basis and we'd have to say that it has since delivered a great deal of convenience to our day-to-day operations as a business. Its easy-to-use interface speaks volumes of the difference it brings to the fold. Cheers.
"Quick support, nice integration, reliable. Looking to see some additional features with more convenient user-interface."
"Love this app...integrates with eBay quickly and picks up variants of you have them. 
Amazon section is great for managing FBA pricing and creating new listings for existing products on Amazon. You can also create new products on Amazon via the Shopify interface. Codisto then brings that data from Shopify into Amazon.  Amazon gating is a problem with certain products but thats not Codisto's fault. Works well with other app that connect with Shopify such as Connectr. 
Best support ever Ronell is super smart...
."
Amazon themselves recommended this App to sync Shopify with Amazon. Very simple interface. Could do with some performance improvements but I'm sure that'll get improved overtime so I'm overall extremely happy.
"App muito bom, interface legal muito facil de usar recomendo a todos que usem esse app. orbigado aos colaboradoresww"
"Easy to use, intuitive interface, very useful. Great job."
"The interface of Codisto is integrated inside Shopify. While this might have advantages we found that it was difficult to work and navigate through the app.
Then, the app modifies the theme when installed. Even after uninstalling it some traces of software remain on the code so make sure to manually remove them."
"I tried all of the Shopify to Ebay feed apps. This is by far the best: it's in a different league and the entry level package meets all my needs as someone who lists 200 products on a seasonal basis. 
The interface is logical and packed with features which you can access all from the same screen. It is intuitive and easy to list lots of products at once, or customise titles/descriptions for Ebay. The template needed a little tweaking to get my logo right, but nothing difficult. It syncs in real time and is incredibly responsive to changes. I used to dread loading new products through the old feed app - it had an obsession with product mapping on products in the shopify store that you had no intention of listing and weren't loading. There was a refresh button that didn't update the sync and a rebuild button that did, but you had to do it all the time if you had made a change to a shopify product.  As you were listing a couple of products in one (correctly mapped) category, it would give large error messages about other store products you hadn't even brought into the product listing area. It stopped allowing the customisation of descriptions within the app, so I had to write my shopify product descriptions as if they were going on Ebay. The template was basic, no variations, no useful vendor info included. Error messages EVERY time about Returns Policy even though mine is the default Ebay one. Error messages on every listing for photos if it included a supplier logo - as they are often less than 500px. Aghh, I hated it and the support couldn't care less and they hadn't improved the app in a year. If fact it got worse. 
Now it takes a minute to list items and the support is fast. They actually answer the question you raise with accuracy and know their stuff.
If you are on any other feed app - TRY THIS ONE now!"
If you have a Shopify store and you want to sell on Amazon - this is the only app you need. I'm sure the eBay integration is great as well - but i know 100% that this is THE tool for Amazon feeds. I went through two other apps and a few long nights before finding Condisto LINQ. The user-interface is highly intuitive. The platform is stable - no bugs. And the customer service is absolutely incredible. Responses to questions are quick and spot-on. Great app + great customer support = Happy days!  Highly recommend.
I just started using this app and was extremely impressed with the platform and the intuitive way it interfaces with Ebay and Amazon.  Also there is 24/7 live chat which is awesome.  The customer service person on the live chat guided me with ease through the process of listing my products.  I'm very enthusiastic about finally being able to list my products on Ebay and Amazon through LINQ!  Highest recommendation!
"Great, easy to use app..Good interface with excellent functionality."
"The user interface looks very intuitive, it's a fast, simple and cheap way to generate traffic on your web page."
"Honestly, if you don't have this app you're kind of shooting yourself in the foot. Easy to install, loads of features and provides an overall fantastic user experience. Along with showing what's popular on your store, ALOT of backend features. Overall just so much explain, but the HUGE 30day free trial is sure sign, that this is 5star worthy. Try it, won't be disappointed. 
We've got alot of products on our store, glad to have this app.
Still using and to this date, certainly helped alot with what customers want and how I can target around that."
"A fantastic five star app! As a first time business owner this app was the catalyst for my growth. A great user interface made everything easy.
A++"
"So far so good. I'm excited to see if this can deliver and get my reviews game sorted. The interface is neat, clean and easy to understand. Always a good start!"
"I just started using this. So far so good. I'm excited to see if this can deliver and get my reviews game sorted. The interface is neat, clean and easy to understand. Always a good start!"
Support is quick and responsive. The app interface is easy to use and looks great for both front end and back end.
Fantastic app! Has transformed user experience!
Much better than some of the alternatives so far even though I'm only one day in. Great interface and easy to use.
Read some okay reviews the interface looks okay on the stores. Hopefully this app can take me over 7 figures!
"The app interface has a bunch of features for everyone's needs. Compared to the basic Shopify review app this destroys it! Also, the support team are super professional and gets things done in a timely manner. I look forward to sticking with them and upgrading in the future. I managed to import all my Amazon reviews with few clicks!"
Cross Sell is simple to use -- you'll be up-and-running in minutes. Just download the app and their team of developers will even take care of installation for you! The interface is plug-and-play and very intuitive. The developer was also extremely responsive via email and listened to a couple product features that they're putting on their future roadmap. Five stars for Cross-Sell!
"Great customer service!! Maya helped me to solve my issue
Also, the interface is super friendly - great choice!"
"Great app, but the interface could use some work, looks a little funny"
Super easy to use. Interface is very user friendly  Tech support was very helpful and quick to reply!
Excellent user interface! Easy to setup too. The support team is great and the visual side for customers look awesome. Glad I got it.
"The Cross-Sell app seems to be exactly what we are looking for. The customer support has been fantastic, and they helped us install the code quickly. The dashboard and interface are extremely easy to use. We are looking forward to seeing how much our conversion rate improves."
"The interface is easy to understand and the functions are useful. Besides, the develop team is really helpful!"
"We have only just recently moved across to Shopify and so far love it. However, we were surprised by how limited their email templates are and the ability to easily modify them. Without an app like Spently there’s too much coding required compared to how simple everything else is in Shopify. Being able to modify email templates to match the look and feel of Scott’s brand as well as have a nice easy to use interface that matches the rest of Shopify was a must. We landed on Spently, and while it’s early days, we’re liking how easy it is to modify and change the templates and still get a professional result.
We’d like to see more ability to drill down into the data (e.g. rather than just total numbers of opens, who actually opened the email), but these updates I hope will come.
Really delighted with the Spently app so far and looking forward to being able to cross-promote products and drive repeat sales. Well worth the addition and an essential first app to add to your Shopify.
- Update: We had a slight issue with Spently's new auto follow up working on Safari, but Ren was right onto it and had the issue sorted for us promptly. Thanks."
"the emails look really good now, had struggled a bit with the interface and choosing what email template set up would convert on my store and contracted the guys to set the templates up for me with images I provided, good personalised service and responsive to changes.
got a 130% open rate and a 23.6% click through rate so far resulting in a $332 ROI so far."
"First off, the Spently crew gets it. Excellent product. Very fair price. Easy installation. Kick ass customer service. There are a lot of beautiful apps out there but more often than not you are left on your own accord to install, learn a new interface, hunt and peck, and test, test, test until you get it right or just uninstall the app in frustration. Not so with Spently's Review Notification Email Editor & Analytics. From the moment I installed the app these guys were in contact (automated and Non-automated) and made sure I had all the info I needed to use their app to it's full potential. Our personalized children's CDs have custom product options that need to be pushed into the Order Confirmation emails. So when I had a couple requests to tweak the liquid code to my specs Ren spent probably too much time helping me get it right.
Huge thanks to Ren. 
The bottom line is this is how all app companies should conduct their business. If more app companies truly focused on helping their customers in the set up phase they would make more money and have more loyal customers. Thanks, Spently, you just gained another loyal customer."
"Perfect app and top customer support! The app has a nice interface and it is relatively easy to set up. It has everything that one can respect from a marketplace integration app. The customer support of this app is nothing short of amazing though. The team is knowledgeable, polite and very quick to respond to queries. These guys will be with you until the issue is resolved. We have used many apps, but very few of them have such outstanding customer support. Special shout out to Shubham from their team-he above and beyond to make sure that the app is running as intended. Keep up the excellent work!"
I used this app to easily identify images that were slowing down my website and efficiently compress them! This saved me a ton of time and I'm sure will make the visitor user experience on the store a lot better!! Thanks so much Swap Photo Editor!!!
Couldn't be happier with this app! Such a simple interface & really helpful instructions that include tips on what to write in each email. Definitely worth it! Kel x
"Great application, love the friendly user interface. However, when you use it on a product that offers many sizes, it doesn't refresh on the frequently bought together. 
Example : When loading the page, my product is by default a bag of 2.5kg. However, if I want to purchase a bigger one by selecting 10kg, the frequently bought together does not adjust to this. So when people press add products to cart, they find a bag of 2,5kg in their cart.  
If the devs could fix this situation, this app would be fantastic."
"Took me a moment to understand the app and how it's working.
I am not a tech expert so I've spent many hours chatting with the team. Finally I feel confident enough to write a review :)
The app interface is the best I have come across and it does exactly what it advertises. Such great chat and phone support. Can highly recommend!"
"Used the app to create multiple bundles on my site. This was the only app that I found that had all the functionality I needed. I installed and deleted literally 7-8 apps before settling on this one. Its back-end interface maybe a little lacking, however, give it a chance and you will not regret it. Works smoothly and with a great customer service team to back you on any request. They cleared out all the ""bugs"" that came up during integration on our site within 2-3 days. HIGHLY recommend."
"Was not a great experience. The interface doesn't initially align with store design. Even with support trying to fix fonts and colours, it doesn't look professional on my customer's end. Then removed the app and it got messy. Code left everywhere. App creates free variants alongside normal variants that were left live on the store. Had customers buying 'free' items before I could find them all! Angry customers wanting to know why they couldn't get all their multiple free items they ordered. Never really got to test how well the app functions in-cart. Thankfully I had backed up the store and could revert, but had to manually scour every product to delete all the free variants!"
"After testing 5 other apps on the Shopify store I was delighted to find TMS. It works exactly as I wanted with a really user friendly and intuitive interface and I could start as soon as I downloaded it without much need for instruction. 
I had one small hiccup and wrote to customer service and they came back immediately, not only did they provide the solution, but they also went into my store and did the work on one of my pages to show me how to do it on the others.
I would wholeheartedly recommend this app for translations."
"I have made the terrible mistake of using omnisend only to find myself with horrific headaches and a very unfriendly user experience. Thank you so much, Shopify for your easy to use interface and great service as always."
"Used the app to offer buy one get one free promotion and it delivered.  The native discounts function on Shopify works but is not intuitive to the customer (you have to add two items to cart to make BOGO come true).  The user interface is not super straight forward, but luckily the support is very quick to respond and they were able to resolve my issues quickly.  Would recommend for anyone looking for a gift offer function to their store."
Very easy interface. I love how everything is already directly linked to the store so I have less work to do and the templates are already so eye-catching and well laid out. I will be using this as my email software from now on.
Super helpful support and an easy to use interface! Worth the $5-$20 a month for any business to run reports or export specific data!
It is a good app for marketing and I like this concept. The interface is easy to use. a7b77760e6074343b994696752f23273
"I like this App because of the extra elements that I was able to add to my site's pages for a great user experience. My two requests are:
1. Please increase the number of existing pages that can be modified with Shogun, in the Build plan. Currently it's only 25 pages (Build plan) and then jumps to 250 pages in the Measure plan. That's a big jump. We don't ask for more users under Build but please increase the number of pages e.g. 150 pages in Build plan would sound reasonable and comparable with the Measure plan.
2. Allow the existing home pages of Shopify to be edited using Shogun.
The customer support has been great. I will always look forward to new elements that Shogun will keep introducing to make our site visitor's experience even better :)
PS: Waiting to have access to more pages in the Build plan, thank you :)"
"We have been using this app for over a month now and during the critical ""getting to know"" phase and initial configuration of custom reports we have been amazed by the level of support (quality, availability and willingness) from Data Export. Whereas some of our needs are complicated, they have immediately stepped into assist or even configure for us. And the level of expertise is broad so that interfaces with third party systems is no challenge to them. We could not recommend more highly!"
"Very good app, nice. The interface is really simple. Customer service very fast and cool! I highly recommend"
"une application vraiment ergonomique. Très simple d'utilisation. Je l'utilise pour mes deux boutiques web et elle m'a permis très rapidement d'avoir un site multilingue. Elle permet des traductions automatiques en appliquant des régles générales mais elle permet aussi des traductions personnalisées et tout ça dans une interface très accessible et agréable.J'aurais pu donner 4 étoiles car jamais rien n'est parfait , mais c'est le support qui permet cette 5ème étoile. Toujours disponible et incroyablement réactif. Je ne peux que recommander cette application (et pour en avoir tester d'autres , croyez-moi , celle-ci est vraiment très bien )"
"2019/03/21: Update Review to 5 stars. Thank you to the Weglot support team. They follow-up on the review I made yesterday and fix the issues I mentioned. Really nice and efficient support. Give them a try!
2019/03/20: Good app, machine translations are really better than any other apps I tested before. Even if some translations have to be reviewed by «human» to make them better fit context and idiomatic syntaxes. I particularly like the automatic language switch according to user location. Interface is not really user friendly, but become easy to use after spending few time on it. Nevertheless, it is a little bit expensive. I'm sure they can make a better package for Shopify store owners as some glitches exist, especially on pop-up cart window. See it in action at https://www.warfattitude.com, you'll get a better idea."
"Everything i could ask for & more. At first the interface feels sort of basic, but you can actually achieve a lot of customization just by using padding/margins support is reacts within a few hours too. would recommend to anyone who cares about the look of their side, but can't code :D"
The interface is a little challenging but the customer support is incredible. When I've struggled with anything they've gone above and beyond to get what I was looking for. Thanks!
"Logiciel plus que correcte, interface facile à utiliser.  Aide sur mesure avec une super réactivité, équipe au top."
"Since we are exploring Shogun, we cannot say much about their functionality. User experience, though, is very good but what definitely is understanding is their technical support. We had two requests that were taken care of immediately with no hesitation to walk the extra mile. Thank you!"
"Very nice user interface and general workflow when translating the content of my site, and their support is second to none."
"Good app and excellent customer service ! Really friendly interfaces, easy to translate, do perfectly the job"
"I'm currently using the app. Extremely useful, automating the orders and the tracking info between Shopify and Amazon (we used to do this manually, now everything is automated).
User friendly interface, it has all features to be relieved from some daily manual actions.
Customer service is extremely helpful and reactive (a few hours to fix a problem, available on WhatsApp and Skype, professionals).
I highly recommend this app"
Kind of useful app but the user interface and the structure of the app can be improved. Im with the free account.
I don't really know the efficiency but the automation is amazing and the interface is very good. Advisable.
"The app works great. There were some things I didn't understand about how it interfaced with the various Google apps. But Simprosys support was extremely helpful in helping me understand how the app interfaced with Google Merchant, Google Ads, Google Search, etc. I am very appreciative of their help and patience with all of my questions!"
Very good app and support. I can recommend it. User interface could potentially be a little bit clearer and cleaner.
"A great new pre-order app we thought we'd give a try as a result of a technical problem with our previous provider. 
Pros;
- clean, easy to understand interface
- plays nicely with Collections, making bulk actions easier
- countdown and quantity limits per SKU are great for our vinyl record store where we get limited quantities of stock
Cons;
- doesn't leverage Shopify tags directly ie: you can't use tags to automatically add a product to a pre-order group
- only one message for pre-orders overall - you can't have different messages per category 
On the whole, we're liking it a lot and look forward to where Globo take it!"
Good app that does the job. And their support is great. However the interface could be better and easier to use.
"Recharge provides my store a lot of functionality, simple interface, great customer support (Hi Rudy!) when I've had questions their tutorial videos didn't get me through."
"I use this app currently to recover abandonment cart messages into buying customers. For this I've enabled the option to send updates to messenger along with giving them a discount. I think this would recover my many abandonment carts and help me drive more conversions. Even though I like the overall system, the interface of the app itself could be improved. You need a few to figure things out and navigating could be a challenge and it can get a little daunting at first. If they could work on that and make things more accessible and visible, this should be amazing."
Great App!  The level of services were very prompt too.  Problem solved!  Love the new user interface too.. Not sure if we received any notifications but if not they should send notifications whenever there are new updates which we were unaware.  Keep up the great work!
"Probably the most UN - USER FRIENDLY app on Shopify. Customers find it hard to swap, pause, cancel, items. Admin backend is terrible and backward, need 100's of clicks to make changes and have to do everything ONE BY ONE. Support is slow unless you PAY FOR PREMIUM SUPPORT. You should know the value of recurring orders is HUGE for online stores and you need to improve your over all interface. I have lost customers as they get frustrated to use the customer account management system, its terrible"
"Great app for pre-orders. Especially since they have upgraded the interface and it way easier to use than before. On top of that the customer support are ALWAYS on hand and ready to help. Highly recommend. 
I have sold a lot through this app with preorders and plan on using it further."
"Great app that does exactly what it's supposed to. The interface is super sleek and straightforward to use, and offers lots of customisation. The support team  have also been great when needed. Would definitely recommend the app!"
"We recently switched to ReCharge in order to integrate with a new loyalty and rewards platform. Not only does ReCharge fulfill that need for us, it's also a much better user interface for customers. ReCharge support has been very helpful as well whenever we have questions or run into roadblocks with implementation."
"Good interface, but some support issues and multi store set up not clear. A lot of going around in circles"
"You can create some really slick, modern, and professional-looking sites with Shogun. The interface is pretty straightforward and simple, but can be a bit clunky when trying to rename elements or navigating the sidebar in general. Lots of options for responsive elements and you can even edit elements to only appear at certain resolutions - making it possible to have a mobile and desktop version of a page that are completely different. The staff is quick and responsive to questions! Kalen Christ and Sweetan Mankotia both were very helpful and polite. I will happily continue using Shogun!"
"Just Started using it. Looks pretty helpful. Will update after using for few days, Easy to use interface."
"This application is super helpful and easy to use, with a simple interface and easy to understand prompts."
I was struggling with the interface last night while under a deadline and I contacted customer service.  It was after hours and they went back and forth with me until it was fixed.  Great customer service.
"Clunky use of 3 separate interfaces to setup: App, website, aftership account, needs to be streamlined. Absolutely needs to put notes in the order timeline with updates, pending return, authorized, etc. wouldn't be as big a deal if it were more easily accessible from the same window, but since the app functions using 3 different interfaces it creates more work and more switching between windows. Need to be able to manually create an RMA from main page for customer that call in, seems like a super easy/obvious function to include.
Update: you have to additionally install Aftership tracking in order for the returns system to be functional. Everything will stay in the approved until you get it at the door. The only way to track them is to individually copy and paste the tracking numbers. The system is set to only really work with their other tracking app which will track all of your orders not just returns. Which means for us another $100 a month on top of the cost of this app for it to be functional. Highly discourage you getting into their app system."
"Waited at least two hours or more for these people to approve my ads for pet bird products that are already authorized by Amazon. Sent them lots of messages about approving my ads and getting them running to no avail. This is a HORRIBLE service that wasted hours of my business time today. CLUNKY INTERFACE. Horrible time trying to setup ads. Setup two ads that never were enabled. Could not find a way to cancel this app from my store. This system could work well but there are lots of confusing issues. Ads created/pending are not listed anywhere that is comprehensible. Every time I create an ad the page changes to a data page with no data or info about the ad I created. There is no way to see how many ads you have pending or otherwise. The support team says ads have to be approved and approval depends on how many are in the queue. All the while their ads are showing on my pages but my ads are not running. This is a very confusing non-sensical system. Difficult to measure any daily business potential with this system. Also the app does not show up in my Shopify store admin. I have to go to the Shopify app store, browse for the app and click on 'add app' everytime to access my Verinode account. ---I found the listing for the ads I created by going backwards from the ad creation page. Have four ads sitting in the queue quite some time now not approved. This does not work for my business. I am not paying this company to wait for my ads to be approved. This is no way to earn my business."
"The support is one of the worst I've seen so far for a Shopify app. They seem to not be able to understand my questions. The 3 stars are for the interfaces. It looks prettier than another app that I was considering. As far as capabilities, it's just ok. I still have to do a lot of work on my end, but at least it makes the return process easier for my customers."
"Shogun makes sprucing up your default Shopify pages really easy. If you don't know how to code AT ALL, you can still execute significant improvements to your existing pages using their editing interface. 
If you know how to write a little custom CSS/HTML, then you can probably fill in the gaps for any customization options that Shogun doesn't provide out of the box. 
Overall it's a really helpful tool and their customer service has been truly awesome. It's a cheap way to provide a serious visual boost to your site. Certainly worth a trial if you're in the market for that sort of thing."
"Update 12/3/2019: 
The developers reached out to me after this review to offer their support and apologize for the unhelpful responses I was getting. Since then, I have processed 10+ returns using their app and it has worked well. There are some feature changes I would like to see before I consider it a ""5 star"" app, but it's certainly functional and does it's core function very well. 
I am updating this review to 4/5 stars and would gladly give it 5 if return shipments were easier to track (and had email alerts!!). It currently takes several page refreshes to see a shipping status from USPS and that's just not acceptable. There's nothing worse than a customer sending their return and it just sitting there without the shop owner getting alerted. 
Original review: 
So far the interface seems good but I'll only know later down the road when my store starts getting returns. This 2 star review is strictly due to the poor AfterShip customer support. 
After I set up my account with aftership, I needed to go back in and change the return address (where my customers send their product back to) but I couldn't figure out how to go back and change this in the settings. I shot an email to AfterShip support and they kept copy/pasting the same response in their reply. ""Hello, Please contact courier or shipper directly. AfterShip is only a shipment tracking platform. Here are some useful articles for you."" And just so you guys know, I was very detailed in my emails about being the owner of a shopify store and even sent the emails from my support@ email address.  
I eventually figured out how to change the address myself, but I wasted a whole week waiting for an actual response (that never came). Just the same copy/paste that had nothing to do with my question. 
Hopefully everything works well once returns start coming in because this joke of a support will definitely not be there to help."
"Exactly the app that i need. After ""Relic Sales Volume Report"" app got deleted and not working anymore, i searched for another alternative and found this app! Reuben was kind enough to help me to generate the first report and it has the number of sales by SKU and time period which i need. It's not graphical interface but once u get the report done, it's basically just a click away to generate your latest report. Give it a try!"
"Horrible app!!!
They Added features after the initial install and billed for things we never signed up for. Sketchy and confusing interface after conversion from original app. Moving on to something else."
good product and very good support so far. The interface could be a little more intuitive but very good overall
I used it to export sales data but more to determine the split of items on sale vs items not on sale. Gave me all the info with an easy to use interface and support is amazing.
This has a nice interface and is free and helps easily facilitate returns.  Returns can be a difficult thing for any business and anything that makes it easier helps.  Thanks.
"The app is free, but it doesn't mean that it was done bad.  We use their Aftership plugin for tracking and we added this because the other app was so amazing.  Returns is a pain and this provides a great way.  Very easy interface, my only issue is that I wish it was more customizable."
I have recently set up a new online store that sells products internationally. It is still early days and I have only had sales in one currency so far (USD). But I have no doubt my customers will enjoy a seamless experience when paying with other currencies when traffic to my store increases. This is because the currency conversion interface appears easy and straightforward to use.
Simple to use. Great interface. Love this app! Makes advertising a snap! Highly recommended. Best we've used so far!
"So far so good, takes care of a lot of the headaches of returns and gives a nice user friendly interface for the customer."
"(Edit 12/04/18) We were having trouble with upgrading to their new platform as this one will be discontinued so we followed the steps and the API would not work as much as we tried so we contacted customer support and thats when the hell began. What a bunch of incompetent people, never have we dealt with a company who does not know how their platform service integrates with shopify and having to tell them how the collaborator feature works for them to fix the bug. This problem has been going on for around 1 month and is still not fixed. Very disappointed and will happily be switching to another cheaper platform. 
(Original post) Easy to use interface have been using for about a month or so, the only downside is there is no way you can customise the emails when you select shipment received. So therefore for you to let the customer know you have the return package it will also tell them that you will be refunding them yet what if they need a return for exchange not a refund? For that reason we have had to find a new returns system."
"How to professionalize your customer returns with a simple application.
Aftership did it. !
Easy to use, the interface is clear. It can easily be translated into another language.
Now finished the explanations between the customer and you by email.
I love it.
Thanks Aftership"
I tried other Apps to import CSV and keep in daily sync from suppliers and this one just stood out as easy to map with a drag and drop interface. - no hassle. The help team has been able to fix my self made errors within minutes and above and beyond helpful. The market integration makes adding new stock from new suppliers a breeze
I like it. Wish there were more options for the plans for small businesses. But it has an easy user interface!
Great interface and customer service. Would be nice if there was a plan in between the free and $29/month plan as small businesses can't necessarily spend that much monthly on just social proof. Looks professional and unobtrusive on my page and has a lot of nice extra features.
Excellent app! Transformed how we do business! This app has allowed us to give our customers the option for delivery or store pickup with great user experience. We can control the delivery and pickup slots and it's great to be able to view all orders for each slot in the admin. It does require being quite tech savvy to get set up but customer service have been brilliant with any questions or problems I've had with set up. Thank you! Keep up the great work.
"Great app!  Interface/setup takes a little getting used to, but the support is OUTSTANDING.  Does exactly what I needed it to do.  Would recommend."
Aaron the specialist helped me config the app and build a smooth checkout user experience based on complex pickup and delivery logic. Thank you Zapiet!
"This app made a massive difference to how our cart operates in the best possible way.  Customers really like to see the extra items physically in their cart and though the interface is a little clunky, the app is super powerful and can do anything we’ve wanted so far, very pleased!"
Sales Pop is the best app i have used as the custome service is splendid and the interface is pretty user friendly. Also it serves it purpose well as a proof the website is live and well.
"Works like magic! Perfect for any shop, it drives customers towards cart in a strategic manner. Pop can be customized and love the friendly app interface! Customer service is prompt and to the point!"
Fab app. Free plan really good for beginners :) simple to use if you know nothing ! Nice interface as well
App works great! Backend interface is so easy and pop ups look very elegant on website. I came across these pop-ups on another shopping website and was looking for exactly the same plugin for mine. Here I find the perfect match :)
"Very useful application, I totally recommend the website for multi-currency conversion, beautiful interface with free plan, highly recommended!"
"Great and simple app,I totally recommend for multi currency converted sites,nice interface with a free plan"
Does exactly what it claims.  Setup was fast and easy with free assistance from their team.  The portal has a well-designed interface.  Price is very fair and has saved us a ton of manual work.  Highly recommend.
"Clunky app and even worse support.  I have dealt with numerous app developers and Zapiet wins the prize at being the least competent/communicative.  I don't suggest anyone use Store Pickup + Delivery and stay away from Zapiet apps entirely if it's avoidable.  There are some really great app companies that will work hard for you, Zapiet isn't one of them.

They completely misled me about the capabilities of this app.  Let me save you some time:  If you are expecting an app that is quick and easy to setup, look elsewhere.  If you are expecting any kind of timely support from their staff, look elsewhere.   If you have an expectation that the app will be able to manage shipping rates as advertised, look elsewhere.
Zapiet support staff weren't able to get me set up with the basic features (I needed no custom work at all) after two weeks, and would make excuses about how small their staff was, and they were trying to get people trained, etc. Meanwhile I was paying them for a non-integrated app.  
It became apparent that they are misleading customers at what the app is capable of doing and the app itself is hamstrung by a huge design issue they don't bother to mention until you are well down the rabbit hole, namely their app currently supports rates for exactly one carrier at a time.  One. Meaning if you currently use or were planning to use USPS, UPS, and FEDEX - which is reasonable - ....you get to pick one.  That's it.  One, no more.  
Of course they don't volunteer this information and are not up front about it at all.  I was well into the integration process when I was informed via a phone call about this limitation that should be clearly advertised on their app page, being that it would be a dealbreaker for many people.
The core problem is this: Zapiet designed an app that has to manage your shipping rates to function fully, but the app is terrible at integrating and managing shippping rates....makes zero sense. Put it back in the oven, this one isn't fully baked yet. 
I told support early on I use stamps.com via Shipstation and was told would be easy peasy to get things going.  This turned out to be completely false, and they didn't even have stamps.com integration.  I was told to wait (again) as Andy, their sole programmer, wrote up some code for stamps.com integration to work.  Ok, but you already told me you had integration in place.  Misleading.
Turns out that didn't work either.  Integration never happened.  Stamps.com was apparently a non-starter for them.  As far as I know they still can't integrate with stamps.com even though they said they would get it going.  
Even further on, they changed what they were saying entirely (after wasting a week of my time) and wanted me do go set up an account to use the USPS.COM API directly, forgoing my current rates via stamps.com.  
None of this was mentioned ahead of time.  They say one thing and then pull a bait and switch.  They tell you they can do things they can't. 
 Completely unethical.
15 days later and the app still is not completely set up and fully functional.  If you use stamps.com and/or shipstation, there are better solutions for you.  
I spent weeks getting handed off from support person to support person, and the app has never worked as it is advertised. I can't call it an out and out scam, because if you just want your customers to select In-store pick up, it does that one thing.  But having it interface with your rates is a nightmare, and their advertising and support staff is highly misleading about it. 
At the end it felt like I was paying them to beta test, and I probably was.  Despite what they were telling me, it was anything but easy for them to get their app to do the basic advertised functions.
Save yourself a bunch of time and look elsewhere.  
Even if the app did what it said it does (which it doesn't), you have to deal with an apparently over-worked support staff that won't get to you for days on end.  When they do, they give you a tidbit to fix/adjust, that you'll have done in 5 minutes, then be waiting another 24+ hours for the next step.  
With how many options there are for apps and app companies in the marketplace, this is an easy headache to avoid, and I suggest doing just that."
"simple user interface, powerful tool.."
Great team to work with to get any problems solved instantly. Recommending this app to anyone who's looking to help ease a customer user experience when it comes to placing an order time and pickup.
Awesome support! They got my issue resolved within minutes. Must get app if you want a clean and user-friendly interface for your order management needs!
Brilliant app which we'd highly recommend if you want flexibilty and to drill deeper into your data. Not only does it give you access to every possible piece of information tracked on your store but you can manipulate the data and schedule your reports really easily. We found our way around the interface really easily but one of our reports was quite complex. We got in touch with Freddy and he did a stellar job and set it all up for us. When we realised we needed a few tweaks he sorted it out for us super quickly. Great tool and great support!
"I couldn't be more satisfied. Zoli from Syncee has been nothing less than extremely helpfull. Not only with the integration but also minor bugfixes that makes the user experience complete.
Now I'm selling more than 1100 sneakers on my website, www.akenz.com.
Thanks!"
"I needed an automatic extraction for our fulfilment provider. It does the job well. Support very helpful and responsive. 
I am not giving 5 stars as I needed to interact with support to get it right (due probably more to the structure of Shopify than the app itself) and as the interface is not totally user-friendly. In a nutshell, perfect if you need a regular extract whose format won't change. 
If you need multiple extractions that need adapting all the time, this might not be for you."
"We use this app to schedule our orders and deliveries. The support team is amazing and helped us set up everything we needed to make the user experience through the checkout a smooth as possible. They are super fast, understand easily and on top they are very friendly. I recommend this app highly. Thanks guys!"
"Great app with great support.  I was looking for something to automate reporting.  This app provides access to all the data fields, very simple interface, and very robust function capability.  The staff support is excellent.  Every time I hit the wall, Eby would pop in on chat and point me in the right direction.  We are launching soon, and this app and the staff have saved me a ton of prep time."
good interface - plus quick and responsive to helping me fix set up issues - would highly recommend!
I use this app to help me on currency exchange. Thank you it help in growing my business and smoothing user experience
I used this app to help me increase sales. It works great! Overall the interface is super easy and it will definitely increase my conversions.
"Great app, user interface seems great ill update after a month on how it has affected my store profits $$"
This app is an absolute must for any shop that does pick up and deliveries. The user interface is sleek and professional looking. Customizability and scalability is great too with Sam and his team always tweaking and making it better. Sam is the man. He's brilliant and works hard to make this an amazing app. The support is excellent as well. He really made time for me and helped to make sure everything was up and running. Store Pickup + Delivery is worth every penny. All good!
"Had some problems importing products from an older ecommerce system and with hebrew chars
nothing worked:( until the AMAZING syncee support help me out...
fixing every issue with the import file and parameters 
even helped me with importing the varients as well:)
i recommend them extremly - they also have a good UX and easy to use interface
hope you will find them as good as i did:)"
"Secomapp has been very easy to work with, quick and professional. It was easy to install Free Gifts, and it works fantastically. Secomapp installed it without any fuss within hours of us getting the app. The back end interface is easy to navigate as well, so it's been very simple to put in exactly the type of giveaways we want to use. It is capable of automatically keeping inventory levels updated, and it also looks great on the front end of the website. Very polished and effective app. I am impressed."
IT looks like very useful. The interface is clean. Hope to see results soon.  Thank You
"I am an unfamiliar with coding and was intimidated to try this app, but found it to be well supported. When I had questions, they were answered promptly and thoroughly. I highly recommend this app for the set up , support and great user experience."
"We've been using this app for almost 2 months now, and loving it. 3 things to love about this app:
1. Flexible & easy-to-use
2. Support is top notch - including when I needed the install done on a Sunday
3. Intuitive and user-friendly interface for the customer
Would definitely recommend."
"Love the app. The interface is easy to navigate. Love that I can customize the design, timing, order and number of sales pop-up. However, the pop-ups rarely follow my selections and varies in the way it is displayed across devices (mobile v. desktop). 
If this could be fixed. I'd be overjoyed!
-Tiffanie"
"This is a great app and does what Secomapp is promissing - and even more. The best is that the app is continuously extended an improved. And it has an easy to use interface to setup free gifts and promotions.
I would actually give 6 stars if it would be possible for an amazing support. I needed some customization so that Free Gifts fits to our brand. There were some missing settings sto be able to fit Free Gifts to German language. John helped imediately - even on a weekend -  and they added further options in the settings of the app to make life easier to configure stuff without the need to dive into the code. Also John was very friendly and had a lot of patience with quite a lot of questions from my side :)
I'm also using Banner Slider and Quick View app from Secomap with the same experiences. Very good apps, easy to use and very fast and very friendly support."
Great app and very easy to use interface. So many cool features helping to boost our online sales big time.
"Probably the best SEO all around plugin, a very complete suite with a great user experience and a superb customer assistance!"
Cool app. User friendly interface. Looked for a sales pop and thus seemed the best fit. Quick and easy set up
"I like this app for sending emails to our customers.  The end result is very clean and professional looking.  I also like that it pulls in our product information directly from our website.
However, it is WAY too difficult to figure out.  For example, it's nearly impossible to find a ""Send Email"" button.  I want to re-send an email to remind customers of our fundraiser tonight, and can't figure out a way to do this.  PLEASE provide an easier-to-use interface.  Thanks!"
"Simple interface; easy-to-use; cost effective. Now, waiting for additional template options and a complete roll out."
"I highly recommend this app. The interface is very user friendly. I have to include that I didn't knew what Alt-Tag and Meta-Tag was and how are these were applied and BOOM I learned right here. Also, with the previews of how your link page is going to look in the Search Engine was vital for me so not 5 stars for this tool I'll give 10 stars. Useful tools in the app and all explained. For now, the first app that I didn't had to request support. BRAVO! Update: This team continue to amaze me, I sent them a lot of questions in order to take all the benefits of the features that this app provides. They answered everything with explanation and purpose of many features and defined me in short terms and easy to understand how to take advantage of them."
"really cool app which can boost orders 
i recommand it for every sellers who using the shopify interface"
"awesome interface, super easy to use. im thoroughly impressed to say the very very very very very least"
Interface très simple à prendre en main. C'est propre et efficace. J'apprécie beaucoup cette application.
"Helpful and good, smooth interface. Hope this increases the sales on our website as customers from multiple countries visit our website :)"
This app helped me set-up amazing pop-ups and I love it. The interface is simple and easy to use. I have no issues with it.
Awesome app speaking as a novice. Plenty of helpful tools and a clean informative interface. Excited to learn more and get the maximum effect from this application!
The interface is clean and user friendly and the pop-ups don't look scammy like other apps. We'll see if it works
Great app really enjoys does everything I need it to do. Love the interface very easy to use highly recommended love it.
Installation was crazy simple. Wish all the apps were this easy to use. The interface is really simple as well.
"Great app for helping new stores build some valuable social proof, a must have app for all Shopify stores 5 stars I enjoyed the easy setup and friendly user interface."
This app is the best for my site! We drop ship a lot and everyone sends their inventory differently. I used to pay someone by the hour to read each SKU and adjust stock. Now it is done in an hour and not a day! THE BEST! Highly recommended. Easy interface
App works well for me to update stock levels from a CSV. Interface is sometimes a bit buggy.
"I loved everything about the customer service and nearly everything about the app.... (easy interface, clear design, elegant, easy to use and navigate)
BUT
at checkout our customers couldn't use discount codes, and this lead to a lot of abandonment when we were testing the app.and a lot - a LOT - of manual fixing of orders and helping resolve unhappiness. 
So unfortunately we couldn't use the app :( 
Would totally re-up if this were resolved and fixed"
This app is great. I have done extensive research on quantity discount and decided on this app for the convenience and easy to use interface. I can customize by category or individual product and can setup customize text and where to place. It's as easy as drag and drop. No coding required. There was some initial setup kinks that needed to workout but the app developer had a quick turnaround to fix the problem. My order sales saw a boost on the first day and we hope it continue to stay that way. Highly recommended
"Great app. It's reliable, affordable and works exactly as advertised. Plus it has a clear and well-designed user interface.  Recommended."
good 5 star.  i like to apps. I wish is totally free the auto switch i like the interface easy to understand
good app for seo. easy interface. 5 star
"Muito bom !! É um app com interface simples, sem bugs, fácil de configurar, e além de tudo e grátis !"
All the apps are really easy to integrate with a very friendly interface. They are all either Free or available at a very reasonable price. Love every app by them!
"App is actually free, had a nice and user friendly interface and did a nice job in cleaning up my SEO"
"I have good feelings about this app, really promising. Finally I found something decent for free. I do not expect free Apps to work perfectly, but as a beginner, I very appreciate free Apps and I have seen so many paid apps being total disappointment. The only thing I realised with apps in general is that developers are asking for a review before any user experience. So I am very thankful that you offer your App for free, and I can already see from the dashboard that it will be a useful asset to my website."
"I'm very impressed with this APP. 
It's a must for all international e-commerce operators.
Its interface, together with the easy to use function for me enhances our website visitors.
Soon, I will subscribe to the paid feature after enjoying my free trial.
I endorse this product unreservedly."
was easy to use and had good interface. I think it provides good marketing opportunities for start up eccomerce sites.
"This apps is a must and just awesome. If your supplier can export files you can automate all the inventory, pricing, publish updates with a user friendly interface.
This app really worth every penny, plus the prices are good.
A+++"
Love this app! Recommend it all the time. This could change the whole user experience for your customers.
"The menu options provided my Mega Menu have greatly improved the user experience on my website, and the app is very easy to use."
Great features and very good app. We really like the interface and its very easy to manage all the key features. Highly recommend.  I need it for sales pop ups
User Interface is well built and structured. This app is packed with useful features not found on many of its paid alternatives.
Very clean interface. Provides small popup in the bottom left corner which persists for a couple of seconds and shows recent orders. Clicking on it takes you to the product page of what was ordered. Very simple and efficient.
It is better to have a Chinese interface.It is better to have a Chinese interface.It is better to have a Chinese interface.
Great product - very nice new interface - loads of functionality - thoroughly recommend it! An API that will integrate Google Spreadsheets with a shopping cart - finally! Bye bye Magento! I recommend using Stock Sync!
"Great app, love the user friendly interface so far cant wait to see how it will work for my site...."
"Very convenient and fairly priced. Simple interface that ""just works.""  The automated feature makes this product a must-have for business owners carrying a large number of SKUs."
great stuff chaps i like it a lot smooth and easy to use nice user interface and graphics thanks .
Great drop down menu App! What I like is it's easy to use. The interface is simple yet very effective. Definitely a recommended app! Happy to use it!
Very happy with this app so far! It has made the user experience so much more intuitive and organised.
"Seems like it works. The interface is really nice, but you have to put the code in by yourself which makes it a bit harder."
Very easy to set up with a step-by-step configuration without needing to leave the Shopify interface.
Good user interface and clear info about what are you doing on every screen and what is the data for.
Just installed this app and I hope it could bring me more sales and higher conversion rate. Leave 5 stars here for nice interface.
A really easy-to-use app with drag-and-drop interface. Really simple yet effective solution to menu display. I have an online flower and gift basket store and this app allowed me to arrange flowers by flower type and gift baskets by wine type. I had a couple of questions and these were answered promptly. Highly recommend.
Great app. I would improve the user experience while creating campaigns but the rest is fine. Segmentation is super acurate.
"Just installed this app.  So far, loving the super user-friendly interface.  Looking forward to playing around with it."
I used this app for more trust. I really like it and the interface. The support was fast and reliable.
"Clean, easy to use interface, effective and looks good."
Great app that makes our site look much more professional. The interface is extremely easy to use and navigate - we were able to get our full menu done in less than an hour. We had one minor issue and reached out to their developers and they responded within minutes and it fixed right away.
"Easy to use interface and effective menu. I had a couple technical things I had to work through and the support was top-notch. Very responsive and helpful. I'm only using the free version at this point. I plan to expand when I get my store up and running but would recommend to others. If they provide this level of support to non-paying customers, I imagine they have a great focus on helping your business too."
"1) Fast response from Customer Support
2) Easy and simple User Interface
3) Fast and menu creation
4) No coding needed
5) Works right out of the box
6) Best feature: Drag and drop ( prevents time consuming edit)
7) Robust features
8) Menu editing, just click onto the menu and rename.
9) Well designed (especially for non-coders)
10) Video tutorial was very helpful.
11) Allow you to change your menu color, and link hover color.
12) Change your menu font size.
I tried using other Menu app creation and quickly abandoned them because it was time consuming, complicated, tedious copy and paste. I was very frustrated and gave up.
With this app I was up and running. I was able to create Parent menus, Child Menus and Sub-menus within minutes. I wasn't forced to copy and paste code.
The drag & drop feature gave me the advance view how I want to layout my menus and tweak things around. This was a time saver!! 
The ability to edit the menus by clicking on it and renaming, selecting a different icon from the dropdown.
Excellent and speedy Customer Support. All of my emails were answered within the same day or within less than an hour. I highly recommend this app.
Even though the other app have a Knowledge Base instructions it still wasn't easy to create and it didn't have a video tutorial, so it got me lost."
"Great app
Friendly interface
Prompt customer support
Looks perfect on our site
What more can you ask! Keep up the good work guys... :)"
I really love this app. It's easy to connect to & interact with. Very cool interface & it's manageable for my product!
I used this app to setup my Instagram and Facebook with my Shopify store. Easy user interface with helpful tips and easy to use
Great new interface and smooth login. I like being able to directly use my shopify products in Facebook.
"The app is well-integrated and generally setup was easy to follow; however, on the Facebook side, there's a lot of business marketing jargon that I don't understand. The entire Business Manager setup was not intuitive and, again, contains jargon that people who are not in the industry will not understand. The Business Manager experience needs an interface update, too. I'm just sitting here hoping things work out and that I didn't sign up for something I didn't know about."
"It look great, let me try it for a while and see if that improves UX. Whatsoever, the app Interface is friend user, good job !"
Easy to use interface and LOVE that it's free! Thank you so much! :)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))_
"I start to use, the interface and idea looks  nice. However, I have to try more on this app's funtionality"
"The new FB app integration with Shopify is a way better user experience and finally, they combined IG and FB into one app :) It takes a bit longer to setup but worth it"
Very Simple App ! Thank You! It really improve user experience! Lots of cool option when you upgrade plan! worth it!
"This app has a bit of a confusing interface but once we learned it it is able to push our products to etsy, import our orders from etsy to shopify, and map every product we have already created on either platform.
The customer service has been five star. They have answered every question extremely quickly.
If you download this app give yourself a bit of time for a learning curve, I would suggest to the developers to continue the UX/UI of the app to make it more intuitive."
The integration helps provided me with a seamless management experience of my inventory...wish the user interface was more intuitive.
The app does what it is suppose to do and the interface is very straightforward and simple. Easy recommendation!
I really like the process of this user experience is good. Instructions made it easy to go through the process easily.
"Great app with easy interface! However, it would be much better if AliExpress Standart Shipping was integrated in the couriers list! And the live chat is really quick to help you!"
Very useful app - helps me to manage all the shipments in one place and also offers a better user experience from customers' perspective. Team support is also amazing which provides a great level of ease of mind using this app. Highly recommend.
"Have been using Spently for a while now and would recommend it. Nice clean interface, very easy to use, and easy to design great looking emails. Very customisable.
Andy. Head of Beard Relations at Worthy & Spruce"
"doesn't take time to install, easy to install and works perfectly on the website. The user interface is classy."
Update: I have encountered a few issues after changing my website domain. Ankush from Support was very supportive and helped me out for an hour till my problem was solved. Deeply appreciate the patience and assistance rendered. Himanshu from the Support was very patient and answered my queries thoroughly with explanations and pictures. I would recommend for their service! The Aftership interface was also very intuitive and easily navigable!
"Really good. A lot of options available, and a really profesionnal interface. Everything needed to build a trustfully brund"
"This app has great functionality for shipment / shopment satisfaction )) I am grateful that it has a free plan available for a growing business. Easy step-by-step instructions, user-friendly interface! Great job! Happy to have it!"
"Love these templates! Our emails are now cohesive with our branding and look awesome. 
The app was super easy to set up, the templates provide a lot of room for customization, the instructions are clear, and the interface is super intuitive. 
Kudos to the developers for creating such a needed product and for being such nice humans.
Thanks guys!"
The customer service is very quick and professional. The website interface is quite simple and comprehensive. Will test the after shipping tracking in few days !!!
"So far so good, the app installed seamlessly and the interface is easy to use. Now to test how well this helps conversion rate!"
Very enjoyable to use and easy user interface. would recommend to other shoppers looking to get social proof
AfterShip has an easy to use interface and does a great job consolidating all orders along with their tracking.
It was helpful to integrate the Facebook and Instagram feeds directly to the store. I think a link directly to the Facebook Ads manager from the Marketing interface might be useful. I wasn't sure my first campaign was directly connecting to Facebook
Helps in setting up Facebook to my store. The interface looks like it will be very useful. I won't really know until I actually use it.
New user of the app and setting up my first tracking page. The interface is easy to use and the support chat is very responsive and helpful! I will definitely keep tuning my tracking page using this app.
Absolutely amazing. I found all features & options I needed. The interface is beginner friendly and the app is very easy to use.
"O aplicativo é muito fácil de configurar, a interface é linda e o suporte é extremamente rápido e eficiente. Em todos os momentos que precisei dele, me deram muita atenção e resolveram todos os meus problemas/dúvidas. The app is very easy to set up, the interface is beautiful, and the support is extremely fast and efficient. Whenever I needed him, he gave me a lot of attention and solved all my problems/doubts."
I use this App with Shopify and I am satisfied with the user interface which simplifies the connection with Facebook ads
"Really happy with this app, quick and friendly support and an easy to navigate interface. It's let us create a uniquely branded courier updates page, plus lets us track which shipments are running late."
Great plugin and the support team is 5 stars. I will be really excited when they add the option to edit SMS templates so you can customize the user experience.
I used this app for social proof and you can customize a lot more compared to other apps. Easy to use interface. Great customer support.
Quick customer service. Nice intuitive interface. We're just getting started with this app but look forward to the enhanced ability to interact with customers along the stages of the shipping journey.
"It's very simple, easy and clear to configure the business manager as well as the pixel. The new interface is great. i didn't understand anything before. but now everything is very easy and well thought out. It's a great app that makes life easier. Thank you."
Very slick. Would love it if the rest of the world had instructions and interfaces so easy. Maybe you could share your wisdom ?
"The interface is good, the service attitude is good, and the problem will help solve the problem in time will continue to use."
Really good software. Great customer service. Smooth user experience from top to bottom. Would recommend.
"Nice support, great app and really nice user interface, I like the support from the chat with the support of this app."
"Loox is our fave reviews app so far, interface is user friendly and the support team is very ...supportive!"
"Everything went smoothly, thank you for this ease of user experience. I look forward to working with Facebook now and into the future."
usefull and friendly interface... Apsolutly recomended for all new users for dropshipping and other marketing
"I like the interface, it takes care of all the small details customers are looking for when visiting a website for the first time. LOOX takes all the stress and guess work out of adding reviews"
Amazing customer services ! Dedicated to fix your issues. Definitely recommend the app. Great interface and design;
"It's impressive to see the profusion of effort in creating an App so complex and at the same time so simple to use for me that I don't understand anything about programming (and that's why I switched 4 months ago from the previous platform (with dozens of plugins, themes, php version that needed to be updated every day) to Shopify. The Facebook APP does everything by itself. The App sets tens (hundreds?) of things automatically, it interfaces with Instagram and the App published in a few hours all my 160 products on my FB and INSTA windows that were empty and lonely for months. Just one App created a synergy movement, automatically opened the Shopify pages and everything was set up perfectly without any hitch. I'm thrilled to get sales from Facebook without even opening Facebook. (and respecting all the rules!!!!). We are in science fiction, I am honored to have such an advanced e-commerce....... Having done so little myself!. Secondina Staffolini. Milan . Italy"
very useful in terms of user experience and reliability. very useful in terms of user experience and reliability.
"So far so good. The interface is easy to use, customizable and great customer support. It brings the website to a whole new level."
Easy to setup and will continue to use facebook as my main channel for advertisement. Hope to see more improvement of the interface
The app is very easy to setup and not overly complicated. The interface looks great and will definitely help with sales.
"Great guide and information for setting it up, works well. I like the interface and it makes everything very simple"
great interface.looking forward to what it can do conversion wise. easy to install and integrates well...one of best app in the store
great interface..looking forward to what it can do conversion wise. easy to install and integrates well...
Excellent way to build customer trust with a very clean and simple interface. Must have app for any storefront.
"App très fonctionnelle et complète!
De plus ,le support client est rapide et efficace!!!
Il faudrait je pense rendre l'interface et les termes utilisés plus simples pour être parfaite."
Service client réactif et à l'écoute. L'appli apporte un belle interface sur nos boutiques. Je recommande !
Easy to install and easy to use. Love the interface and help which is provided to ensure my store looks on point.
"Hi, This is a free and useful APP. Compared with other applications, its interface is more concise and the operation guidance is clearer. I hope that after the customer chooses the currency, the country can automatically convert into the currency when the order is placed. Thanks...."
"This is a free and useful APP. Compared with other applications, its interface is more concise and the operation guidance is clearer. 
I hope that after the customer chooses the currency, the country can automatically convert into the currency when the order is placed.
Thanks a lot."
"The app so far so good, not seeing any bug, good interface, customer support also very responsive, will update my review again"
"A great and highly recommended app
The interface is very convenient and easy to operate
Recommend that you install it on your site"
Really good app but no french traduction. Great customer experience and good interface. Would recommend for sure !
Au top ! l'appli fonctionne très bien. La configuration du pixel se fait en automatique et les campagnes peuvent être crées depuis l'interface shopy
"Not bad, if there can be a Chinese interface would be comfortable. The human service is not bad, but I do not know if it is a real person."
"Really helpful and fast customer service ! I would recommend this application, and the import of reviews very simple and the interface is very beautiful"
It's a way simpler app than many competitors. I like the interface. Good overall Thanks! I will use it on several stores now that I know how it works.
Customer support is quick and super helpful. The interface is very easy to use and allows you to brand it yourself which is something I really like.
Awesome product. Very authentic interface. WOuld recommend to anyone who has an ecommerce platform.
"I'm loving the app, especially Nancy from support, because she's very attentive and helpful and tries to make the user experience the best possible.
Thank you very much Nancy."
"I haven't added much time to fully use the app since I just started using the app a few hours ago at the time of writing this, but I will say that the user interface is nicely presented and the customer service is superb. Ayden from FireApps was especially a lot of help in getting me set up on the platform and offering helpful suggestions with adding reviews."
"I was going to replace the legacy interface to my Facebook shop but this created a new page, I have many existing followers but it would not connect to that page, If you start from scratch it would not be a problem. I also do not like that it appears to require sharing customer contact information, there should be a separate opt-in for customers, I don't want them bombarded by facebook."
"Easy to use, good responsive interface and easy to implement. Seamless connection and makes tagging products easy."
"It seems like an improvement over trying to understand Facebook's interface, but I am not sure yet, thus the three stars."
"great support team, easy interface, the app is pretty user friendly. satisfied with free account, which i can use while im generating sales"
great aboslutetly. Very easy and nice interface for the customers i like it very much so now i can write

"This app really looks amazing, the interface is very high level and easy to customize. I needed some help from the customer support and they helped me in like 5 minutes."
Great quick fix solution to a timely need. Will likely upgrade to Elite when We've had a chance to work with this a bit and want to further optimize our multi-country user experience. Thanks!
"Comprehensive app, great support team. Will be using for all of our stores. They even reach out to you while you are working, in order to improve the interface if they see opportunity. Grade A service."
great app. easy to use interface. will upgrade after trial. provided quick customer support. would recommend to a friend.
"We have Aftership connected to our Shopify store and eBay. Tracking, Tools, Interface, and client communications - All-Star! GotClearSkin.com"
This is an amazing app. The interface of this app is awesome also it's converting very well. I recommend it to everyone
Reply to my question quickly! recommend! The interface is easy to use. The function is more comprehensive. Can be used for website discounts.
"So much better than Yotpo. Speed, user experience, and support! I would highly suggest using them especially if you are looking for a lightweight option that wont bog down your website"
Super simple! Never done this before and I made it through it without any trouble at all. Thanks for a great user experience.
Wonderful and easy interface. user friendly. questions are answered in a timely manner. pictures are clear and can be viewed via mobile or computer.
"The support team is helpful, knowledgeable and diligent. They stick with you until the problem is resolved. The app is pretty decent once you've set it up properly. Not the most customizable interface in the world, but enough that you can sort of make it look like part of your site. if you squint :-) I wish the customer interface displayed the tracking timetable in a moe graphical and attractive manner.
The problem is that a lot of shippers don't provide very detailed tracking info from their side, so it's sometimes frustrating for our customers. That's not Aftership's fault though.
A bit expensive though at $69/month. The free plan is ok for smaller stores.
Remember to activate your shipping vendors in the Settings, otherwise tracking requests will incorrectly report 'shipment not found' results."
"Nice , excellent, really happy, better than all other apps, best interface easy setup low cost overall best"
Customer support is amazing. This app is amazing. So worth the money. Love the interface and the look of it. Amazing job
"Good interface, and good integration (direct, webhook and API) but some couriers are not supported."
"Très bonne application indispensable au lancement d’une boutique shopify.
Très facile à configurer et belle interface"
"I used this application to set up customer reviews on my store. The configuration and the interface are very easy to use. Moreover, the customer service is listening to answer all my questions. I recommend without hesitation."
I love this app it is very easy to use and also affordable. The interface is very easy to access. recommended

"Very useful app. The interface is friendly and makes it easy to provide customers with relevant information. A few glitches that kick me out of the app once in a while, but the pretty solid app."
I used the old interface for my pixel? I discover this new. It was not realy intuitive for me but very quick to understand. Thanks.
"Great support and beautiful app, I had no problems because the interface is clean and understandable, I recommend it to everyone."
"Easy to use, and great interface and customizable themes. I was impressed by how quick I was able to set up my website."

helpful in my store. nice interface.
"O app tem uma interface simples e intuitiva, este foi o melhor entre aqueles que eu encontrei e me adaptei muito bem com ele. O suporte resolve rapidamente os problemas, mas ainda pode melhorar algumas coisas."
"Awesome app. Except for a tiny misstep with my second order not automatically showing on the Aftership dashboard, everything was just super. Love the simple Aftership page for tracking that I installed. Clean interface. Love their customer support too. The only thing that I didn't like at all was keying in the codes in my liquid templates. I gave up trying to install the button, although I managed just fine on my own installing the page."
Im reviewing this app because it's extremely wonderful. The user-interface is amazing and I love how simple it is.
"Really great App. I have been trying various options out there and this one just looks great on your website, has many customization options and it is user friendly for your customers to upload images. I also like the fact that you can send manually requests to past customers, that you can upload reviews from your previous tools and that you can interface with Google to get it on the rich snippets... Also the review pop shows the product to the customer surfing that same product page... obvious, but my previous tools won't do that. All together a great tool in a consumer world relying on reviews to make a decision"
"Great apps, Highly recommended. Easy installation. Friendly interface. Lots of handling shipping services to connect with.

The App is Great I loved the interface But it hard to use I hope they had a better tutorial how to setup
"Great app that does what it says it does! Easy to use, clean interface. The one downside is that there's no way of disabling the built-in request email so that I can use something like Klaviyo to handle the entire flow instead, but this is relatively minor."
"Great app! Easy to use, good interface, accurate info. Keeps all my tracking numbers in a single place, it's so easy to check out if deliveries are going on time with one quick glance."
I haven't that much far with the interface yet but from what I saw I think it's doing well to provide help.
"Migrating to this app from AliReviews, and I have not regretted it so far. Integrates with many other apps I use, clean interface, the widgets look great, and the best part: high quality customer support."
Easy to install and use. Missing FB account and Pixel can be easily created with just a few clicks within the interface. Finally an easy FB account set up!
The interface for me is a bit confusing for beginners like me. I think they could do better with the instructions to be user-friendly. The help desk though was very helpful so they made up for that.
"J'utilise pour créer mon premier site, idéal pour ajouter un critère d'achat pour les clients.
Interface sympathique et possibilité de choisir les commentaires très intéressante."
"I installed the free version of this app and it is syncing perfectly with my store. So far, support has been great and prompt with responses, and the interface and reports look so easy to use. It's great because we have multiple sales channels, and the app integrates Ebay and Klaviyo as well. The API also lets us integrate direct with our inventory software as well, so we can have a standard post ship service across all our sales channels!"
Very nice user experience and the support team is amazing! They just solved my problems very fast and know my product page performance is much better
Excellent app! Must have. Interface is very easy to use and I'm glad I got this app.
Thanks Loox! Nice interface and good support from the team! Definitely one of the best review apps out there!
"Honestly, i personally think the aftership app is one of the easiest and reliable app for online retailers to use. Simple, user friendly interface and yet it look professional. A highly recommend app. PLUS with their new mobile app tracking, things just got better!"
As a new seller i think it is a great app. easy interface and great help. i would totally recommend it.
Easy to understand and my personally user experience is really very positive. It's the first time I try to sell online but I find that it represents the future of commerce.
"Easy to use, good user interface.
Customer service was patient and friendly. Highly recommended for small businesses."
This app is amazing. Cool interface and simple to use. 5/5
"Their ui interface is very beautiful and the interaction is also great, I like it very much, recommend"
"Simple and easy to use user interface. I haven't tried yet operational side as I have just opened My store but I can see the added value of such an app because I have another mature business which is not an e-commerce selling machinery  business but suffering from the same frustration and issues that aftership that aftership solves. 
All the best."
"The interface is really nice, super easy to use and it works flawlessly. I recommend it to everyone!!"
"Clean interface, powerfull and very easy to use. Thanks a lot!"
"Great app, just what a i need. Good interface. Easy to use and efficient."
"Better than the alternatives out there, very clean interface and extremely easy to import and for the most part the pricing is decent"
Aftership is simply a must app. Don t start your shipping without installing the basic plan of up to 100 shipments a month for free. Their tracking is accurate and their interface is simple. What I like the most is their tracking page where our customer can use their tracking code and check their packages status. In case I get a customer enquiry I can just check the status on my phone and reply instantly. And their customer service is also very good. Lookig forward to more collaboration amd updates!
"Ótimo aplicativo, com ótimas configurações, fácil de configurar e interface bem feito!!! Recomendo muito este aplicativo."
"I really like how the interface works, really intuitive and simple of use. The reviews looks very good on the website. Highly recommend this app.
It is great!!"
"It is the most complete Shopify review app. As a result of using the review app for more than a month, the interface is the simplest, easiest, and most convenient among many Shopify review apps. The communication of the management staff is very friendly, they respond quickly, and they have excellent problem-solving skills."
Easy to install and gets the job done well. Would be good if customers able to use order number or name for tracking to improve user experience.
"I think this is the best review app. I had other review apps before, if you will delete them, the reviews are still in the code. I love the interface, thank you a lot! Best Robert"
this app is great providing best interface for currency conversion and an amazing auto currency conversion feature.
"100% happy with this app!
Friendly interface, cool design, easy review import, no bugs, fast customer service that really helps. Thank you, guys!"
Good for small businesses. Easy to use interface and  very straightforward features.
"A good application, a very pleasant and easy-to-use interface, pleasant support, we fixed the incomprehensible moments quickly and efficiently, later I will write how exactly in percentage terms it helped me."
"Making sure my customers could track their order's easily was something I was really keen to make sure of. Now that I've installed AfterShip I've got exactly that. Setting everything up was simple as the admin interface is extremely user friendly. Since I've just started I'm yet to see things in greater detail but so far, I can tell it's going to be a must have app for my store: https://bonooru.com/"
"very useful
Service 24 hours
Lisa is very professional, patient and attentive
Helped me solve my code problem
Make the interface look nicer"
"Has a easy setup interface which i find quite easy to navigate especially for beginners,a must have app on any store.KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!"
A beautiful interface. A must have for any store. Everything is going great with this app.
This app is pretty cool. Needs more update on the interface. We should be able to choose which products we want
helpful and easy to use app with a user friendly interface. it helped increase my sales over time in my store
I used the app to help me get in touch with my customers. I like the interface because it attracts customers to explore top products
I can not thank the support team at Aftership enough for working through all the questions and the special request that I have had for both the tracking app and the new returns app. Both apps work great and provide a very clean user interface for my customers to track their orders and process returns. Keep up the great work Aftership.
"Amazing app. Easy to use. Extremely well designed interface. Support is fast and accurate. Thank you, Channelle."
"Great app. Very easy to use. As a beginner, I did not know that I should do everything from shopify interface."
Great review app with simple and intuitive interface. I like the customization aspects and the built in review import.
"Great app, friendly user interface and good ideas for websites aiming to sell in different currencies worldwide"
"Excellent app, seamlessly integrates and has an awesome interface!"
"Very friendly and prompt help from the support team right after I installed the app! User-friendly interface, in general a great app and best customer support, I would give six stars if I could..."
"The branded tracking looks very good—far better than the cluttered one provided by our courier. Integration was a breeze and it was exactly what needed for improving our brand's image and user experience. Most importantly, it's a scalable solution so we are looking forward to have AfterShip grow alongside with us!"
"We are new to LOOX, but so far the interface seems both intuitive and streamlined. I had one question about generating a test review, and the LOOX Support Team was able to guide me successfully."
Fantastic App. Results with CTT Expresso in Portugal. Good Tracking. Full Options and nice interface. Thank You AfterShip Team.
Definitely impressed with the interface so far! Thank you for this :)
"The absolute best shopify review app is loox in my honest opinion. Based on three criteria. Other review apps which I could easily tell you loox is in the top 10 of based on my time as an ecommerce store manager, consultant, owner, and marketer. I have never received an ill mannered response like I have with other apps and I have used what's the best shopify review application .. both of them lol, because Loox without a doubt now ( I am saying best based on the ranking in consideration to how long they've been around vs the other top 3 and how many more themes I see them work with, apps, etc. ) would be a good word to use, because Loox is the best price, best customer service, and I believe based on the time I downloaded to now, the fastest growing reviews app on shopify. I've used Shopify for 7 years and only Shopify it's simply the perfect mesh of best and my top choice lol. You could have a successful shopify store with simply 3 key features. I promise, 1. A good theme , 2. Shopify, 3. Loox okay and of course yeah have products, but, I said store haha in relation to sales. I had an inquiry I know other applications wouldn't turn a blind eye to, because simply they thing they're too big? Idk, maybe it's a power trip, but Loox doesn't seem to think they're any better and they literally are. At the top plan, you're paying what you would usually pay for 25-50 reviews on a lot of other apps I've tried in my time, and literally probably 1/10th the features. Loox provided me a quick response, instantly helped me fix the problem, and I know it would take days ( they responded in minutes at like 3 A.M. lol ) .. for other apps to complete, or even reach out to deny your request.. This isn't the first time i'll endorse this application as the best or one of the best on shopify for reviews, but I can tell you it's the cheapest, fastest growing, highest in customer satisfaction for me, and probably easily the most features with a user friendly user interface that you can get to, at least with a budget of $100/mo.. guess what.. if you're budget is $100.. you can get the best plan. Lol, that's usually $5-2,000 or 3 phone calls away lol! Because guess what other apps sometimes want to literally have a call to sell you on earning more reviews, loox doesn't make you do that and gives you so many basically unlimited options that to me, unless you're selling a million items a day ( they have a plan for that volume of clients ) to me and based on my experience is unparalleled and you'll always have to join an "" enterprise "" plan on another app that doesn't offer the same tools that Loox does and loose capital which can be allocated elsewhere. Now paired with the quick response time, fast resolution of a problem I accidentally caused, so it wasn't even their fault, and the quick customer satisfaction, unbeatable, also I must note that I did plan to leave feedback based on what I believe to be the leading factor for any store on sales and return clients, the client is always right even when they're wrong. Lol, I didn't approach them with a demand to help me resolve any problems, simply, simply a request to help me fix it, they quickly, stepped in with no reason to help me, without even thinking twice ( I would not guess they would respond that quick literally to think twice ) , and helped me fix it. Download this app if you're a new shopify store user looking for advice, I would personally always recommend this shopify app and I DEFINITELY will be a life time customer. Thank you Loox Team, you truly are definitely a team that cares about all customers, and an application I know I can rely on having in my store. Thank you Shopify, Thank you Loox, Good Luck TO All other sellers, I do hope you try Loox, I hope this doesn't seem overdone, or oversold, it's really my honest opinion, I would be surprised if anyone has a bad resolution or experience with them. Enjoy!"
"very quick and easy to use, with a slick and simple used interface. Whats better is that it is FREE! thank you"

Interface looks much cleaner and seems much easier to navigate than the old Facebook Shop. I like the way the Shopify app guides you through the app. Happy to have our shop on Facebook!
"We would definitely recommend Aftership to anybody wanting to offer streamlined, automated shipping advice to their customers.  The application links to all of our courier services in Australia which is great.  Saves time and keeps our customers well informed about deliveries. Nice clean interface and seems reliable so far.  Well done!"
This is great. I would recommend it again. I liked the interface and it creates my products in Facebook Shop. Wonderful.

There is no better review app than Ali Reviews! The look and interface are very simple and effective. The support is very helpfull too. Highly recommend!
The updated app interface looks good & easy to use. Encountered some error and Andy was able to resolve within 30mins even though it's a Sunday! Excellent support!
application qui marche vraiment tres bien dommage que l'interface ne soit pas en francais ca serait parfait
"I wanted to try out this updated version of Ali Review, and glad I did it. Setup was very easy and the interface is simple to use. I had a minor issue with my review page, but the support team helped me out very quickly. Definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a good review app."
"Great Experience ++   (Quick, Simple, and very friendly user interface. highly commanded.).."

I think it is very good apps because easy interface and the app has a trial! I like this app. thanks

Fantastic ap. Super easy to set up. Really adds to user experience. The included discount for picture reviews and sharing are a nice touch.
"Absolutely the BEST!!! It was easy to install, nice user interface! HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
Loox offer a clean interface that very fast and easy to use. It allows me to select which reviews I want to be shown on my products.
"The app is simply marvellous, installation was easy-peasy, the interface is very smooth as well as functionality! It even becomes very addictive - to seat and update reviews page to see what my customers think about my products and service. Wow! Last time I felt smth similar was when I created my profile on Facebook way back then in 2009!"
"Very clear interface.
Set up was very easy.
So far it's working well.
Will update after a longer period."
"Great app! Does what is says it will. Easy to use, attractive look and simple behind the scenes interface."
"Great App, easy to use, simple interface, very user friendly - would recommend to anyone to use on their store."
"excellent customer service, they explained me how to use it and how to solve a partuclar issue I got to have, user friendly interface, 10/10 rate!"
"The app is very intuitive. It's a one-click installation, user-friendly interface, and easy to get going. Looks great, too!"
Help a lot with user experience as well as increasing the add to cart function on my website. Helped me increase sales!
"This is a great app as it abstracts the numerous tracking interfaces from multiple carriers into one familiar interface that stays in the store.....
The support from Michael and Andrew is fantastic.  Great App, solid and stable"
"A great app with a very simple configuration interface.
This is the best currency converter app I could find.
A must have app for stores, who have international customers."
"I'm new to Shopify and online shopping for Christmas 2014. So far I've shipped out over 200 orders through Shippo, which has made shipping affordable and a breeze.
However, checking the status of shipment was a manual process: opening an order and clicking on the tracking number.
It wasn't until I was contacted by a customer asking if the item they ordered two weeks prior had shipped? Double-checking my tracking number, it appeared the item never shipped.
Wondering if other customers might be affected, I individually went through each order one-by-one, checking the tracking information to find other possible missing packages.
Let me tell you, doing that over 200 times is ridiculously slow (and stupid on my part). But I didn't know about AfterShip at the time.
I don't know how I came across AfterShip, but it was love at first sight. The program was super easy to install and has been a God-send in giving us a birds-eye view on ALL our shipments from one page! An amazing time saver.
I also like the fact that I can override the system by marking an items ""delivered"" where I've contacted the customer to confirm.
I've been very pleased with AfterShip and believe it will also meet your needs in one simple, elegant, and intuitive interface. Thank you AfterShip!"
"really easy to use, great interface as well i thought it would be complicated but it was really simple."
"The app is great! The new interface rocks and the support are fast and code wizz.
They helped me a lot when I needed their help promptly. Kudos"
apps was awesome and incredible. im satisfied with the apps and the interface is cool and very friendly user
Convenient interface. Detailed setting. Popups with reviews. Reviews carousels. Colors to choose from. Responsive customer support. All this made my first store very lively and branded. I've tried other apps but this is the best one for me. Recommend.
Aftership is one stop destination of logistics. Its support and service was awesome. Great user interface where we can track different carriers in one place and it leads the customer the best experience in shipment tracking. Even it turns our few customers into happy customers. I would recommend aftership as a best solution for ecommerce which deals with multiple logistic partners and Andrew plays a vital role in supporting me with Aftership.. Great Job guys..!
A very convenient software that helps stores increase traffic and sales. Hope to continue to improve in terms of interface and function
Installed aftership a few days ago and Im actually quite pleased. The admin interface is simple and easy to use. Adding the widget to your store templates are extremely easy. They provide a detailed written guide as well as how to videos.
Just started with this app. User interface and documentation is pretty impressive. Very easy to use.
Great App!The interface is really cool.I highly recommend it.Most customers will definitely like how it is.
"This app feels fairly new and a s a new user and new drop shipper, i already find things difficult but this has a simple interface but i do think it would be nicer if it had a tutorial system to teach me how to be more efficient."
Perfect app for importing rated product reviews. East to use and nice user interface. Highly recommended to use.
Bit expensive but all review apps are so I guess it's fair. Easy to use app interface too. Haven't had many problems yet
"I like it！！The speed is very fast, the interface is very beautiful！！I like it！！The speed is very fast, the interface is very beautiful！！"
Talked to Thomasz on the support app and he took the time to help me with all the question I had.  The user interface and the functionality of this app is really easy to use.  I highly recommend this app if you're looking for import or getting new reviews.
Just installed it. Looks nice and clean with easy to use interface. Free to use! Will recommend it.
Easy to use and good interface. :) Hope we can have more tweeking options but over all its one of the best!
"Dashboard failed to render in Microsoft Edge, so I had to swap to Firefox. The Coupon widget is a bit confusing compared to the Shopify coupon interface. I am excited to see how this app works and will update once I have time to use it."
The app is simple and easy to use. The instructions and interface was good and i would recommend for the stores that starts from somewhere...
Awesome will help to build up conversions as it gives a unique user experience
Easy integration and a very slick interface... great job!
"This app truly has all the options you need when adding a reviews interface to your store. Fantastic drag and drop interface and effortless setup. Plus, the design of the review page is top notch!"
"Great app, I use it in three of my online stores. Things I'm missing: 1. Some basic (liquid) logic in the notification emails so they can be customized more. 2. Better integration with shopify admin interface: All tracking happens in AfterShip dashboard which is completely separated from shopify admin. 3. Aftership should autoarchive delivered orders (or should have an checkbox in settings to do so)."
"Fantastic app, super easy to use and integrates seamlessly with my store! Great design and super friendly interface. 
Keep up the fantastic work!"
"Mes 5 étoiles c'est parce que je trouve cette application vraiment géniale, car vous pouvez importer les avis depuis les grandes plateformes Amazon Ebay Aliexpress et d'autres. ils ont aussi une interface très spécifique qui convertit le mieux et différencie de la concurrence, En tout cas je recommande fortement car leur service client est vraiment présent, aidant et à l'écoute, ils résolvent aussi tout les problèmes vous n'avez qu'à essayer par vous même :)"
Its good. honestly im only reviewing this because it gave me 100 extra of something to do the setup. i havent used it yet. will update if necesary. interface is good so far
"So far so good, not only it allows you to provide great customer service to your customer, the interface is amazingly great and app is user-friendly."
"Very responsive CS support. Easy interface. However, the added review wedge isn't the best design and don't have enough customisation options. But it covered the basic and did what it promised."
I love the interface of this app. Truly beautiful and it works better than I expected for a free app!
"Totally seamless integration and most of all, works with the UK... This is a total must have for any Shopify store. We really can't big up this awesome app Amy more. 
We've always wondered how and when our deliveries arrive; Aftership lets you know every step of the way! 
The dashboard look completely designed with a beautiful interface to match meaning you want to check up on all your tracking orders. 
Andrew's help has been second to none and his support has been valuable!
Can't wait to upgrade to the premium Account where you can automate delivery status messages and many other cool stuff too. 
THIS APP IS A MUST!"
"Sales Pop by Consistent Cart use very simple, easy installation, nice interface! Great, I like it, it helps me increase sales much more, thanks to the manufacturer,"
"Easy to install and setup. Friendly user  interface. Just do the necessary settings and you can forget about it. Import from Amazon was easy and smooth. Tomasz is a very friendly and helpful guy, you can rely on him to answer all of your questions, or solve any of your requests.."
"Great user interface!
Very easy to use, on air in 2 minutes :)
Settings are versatile, easy to customize"
"This plugin has EVERYTHING you need a product review plugin to have. The interface is top-notch. Very clean functioning UI. Let's you import reviews from Aliexpress as well as Amazon so you can make your store look busy with a lot of reviews in no time. We needed a feature custom coded and Tomasz went out the way to make it happen for us. Free of cost.
The plugin monthly cost is very less compared to other alternatives. Overall we love it and highly recommend it."
"Seeing where this app goes ,  everything looks very promising the user interface is very friendly an all."
"Easy to use interface , great customisation options and theme intergreations. They have a load of new features incoming that are displayed very elegantly and I look forward to using then. Customer service here very helpful and quick to respond, Lisa from the team was very polite and helpful. would definitely recommend !"
I'm happy with a friendly user interface.
Its the most annoying spam bull crap in the app interface constantly pop up pop up but the app meets function once inside
I'm only getting started using this app but the interface looks clean and the tools available look very helpful.
"Hard to navigate with interface and spammy buttons all over.
Will see how it works once I've actually managed to use it properly. Super spammy and forced to leave a review in order to get rid of some of the spam and ""get started""!
Won't even let me reply or post this review unless I write something with more than 100 characters. According to the word count though I have over 400 characters yet this review isn't good enough apparently!"
Very usable interface with easy to follow instructions. 14 day trial is great for evaluating app live instore before purchase.
Great app really love the simplicity of the User Interface and how it is is being designed.  Just installed today and will see how it goes from here =)
"this is my go to review app for dropshipping. have been using it for 6+ months. easy interface, customizable reviews to your liking and quick customer service"
"Amazing app with incredible user functionality. Super great interface and easy to use, absolutely love it!"
"Love everything about this app. Intuitive easy to use interface, does what is says without hassle.  Can't ask for more."
"I've been looking for an app like this! Great job. Easy interface and everything works amazing! 
5* would reccomend!"
"Quick and easy set-up. Up and running in literally 2 minutes with a sleek interface and minimalist pop-ups. Definitely, recommend!"
I used this app to help me grow sales on my Shopify store. I like the interface so far and I think it will be useful in generating more sales.
"One of the best free apps out there-it does exactly what it is supposed to do, and offers an uncluttered working interface.
I have checked that it converts the currency properly (its linked to xe.com).
Kudos to the makers of 'Best Currency Converter'-just dont go retracting the free version sometime in the future like some other app makers have  done ;-)
Many thanks guys."
"Everything is super! Excellent support, fast and high-quality! User-friendly interface and beautiful design, I recommend it to everyone!"
Easy to use user interface with a lot of option and flexibility for updating SEO.
"So far so good, looks great and very easy to install, will see how it goes and maybe upgrade. Must say the interface on the site looks great!! www.istome.co.uk"
Best app I used for Reviews and also the new User Interface is stunning. Low price compared to other apps. I would recommend this app for Beginners as well as Experts to use it.
"Works like a charm, nothing to complain about. Easy to understand interface and straight forward setup"
"Loox is great - lovely user experience, looks and feels great. It felt like a huge upgrade from the Shopify Reviews platform we were using before. It's been so fun getting photos from our customers. I had a couple of challenges, and the Loox team bent over backwards to make everything work. Strongly recommended, well worth the money."
"This app has enabled me to make our webshop available in five different languages. It takes some getting used to at first, but the simple interface makes it easy to master. I had some problems with placing the language switcher and that some texts from third party apps were not translated, but these problems were dealt with very quickly and professionally, so I quickly got everything in order. So to conclude my review, Langify itself is a very good app to use and the customer support is also excellent. Definitely worth a try!"
I love this app its the best way to get reviews for beginners and experienced users! the user interface is seamless with an easy integration.
"Great customer support - reviews weren't showing up on my site, they got it fixed in few minutes. Easy to use interface"
"Love it, super simple! The interface is easy to understand and it looks seamless on my store :)"
"So far so good: the interface is friendly, all functions are clear. I'm on a starter plan, so there's not much to check, I'll update with the results of SEO optimization."
"We have used Langify to translate our website into 5 languages. It is easy to work with and it gets the job done. Customer support is solid, we have always got a quality response and all we asked for was always fixed, including the switcher placement and tweaks. The interface could have been faster though. All in all, great app and highly recommended. Update: And it is still a good solid app in 2021!"
it has a user friendly interface and saves a lot of time.
"Good interface, great and super responsive support to iron out the final details of integration."
"Very bad, let my shop mess up.Make my interface messy and hard to recover.I used this  app, which caused my shopify shop interface to be confused."
great app works very well with the shopify interface and is easy and simple to set up a review from ali express
The app was ok. I used it for 2 months and removed it because the translation interface was not user friendly.
This app give a user friendly interface to leave reviews. We love it and a lot of customers enjoy giving us a product review. Thanks Loox!
Langify is a great app - simple interface which makes the translation process easy as a breeze. And their support is prompt and helpful! Highly recommend it to anyone who need a multiple-language web site.
I used the app for instantly importing reviews from AliExpress. The app interface is really simple. Just two steps and reviews are imported. Its easier to customize too. Recommended
Feature-rich application with a clear and beautiful interface. It fulfills my needs perfectly. The most important thing is to provide attentive service and continuous optimization and refinement.
"I really like this plugin, but I do n’t know if I can open a Chinese interface, and it ’s also convenient to use"
"fantastic application without any bug, requires no great knowledge of the interface and simple"
"Not the most user friendly interface BUT THE SUPPORT IS AMAZING THEY ARE LIKE MAGICIANS They solve things fast and quick.
Edit: They are very helpful on everything. Never disappoint me ."
"Super application, et service client + que réactif ! Interface très jolie, une des meilleures applications !"
"I downloaded this app so that my customers can post their own images on the reviews. I believe that real customer experiences are one of the best marketing techniques out there. Loox helps me achieve that with a highly user friendly interface. 
I find the backend very neat and easy to use, and there are also options to change the fonts to suit the tone of your website. (you can check mine out here to see what i mean: www.soami.co)
and support is really responsive and patient!! I tested out several Photo Reviews apps and this is honestly the best out there. I highly recommend."
"As its name says, it's simply the BEST currency converter out there. 
Besides being super easy to configure (no coding needed), it's the multi-currency app that has the most features using a very intuitive interface. 
A sweet bonus is the ability to see your product prices in the original currency of your store as well just by hovering the mouse over them and the stellar support from the developer - quick response time is definitely a plus for me.
Oh, and it really looks great on the mobile version of your store!"
"Extremely good support. Good app, recommended for your store. Beautifully displayed interface. Extremely satisfied."
"I love this app!!! The interface is beautiful. Also, the customer support staff is super fast and helpful."
"Very good app, fulfills everything that promises and offers you a great interface to configure what you want besides having a great Muffin support."
Looks very promising!!! Interface looks well designed. Works like a charm!!
Finally a good currency converter! Super easy interface and no coding needed like the others!
"This is an excellent app that is simple and easy to use while possessing a modern and luxurious customer user interface that can be incorporated into any website.
Calogero from Anávo Luxury Beauty

"Must have app, great user experience, easy to use and builds stores perceived value. If you dont have Loox you are missing out"
Happy with Langify. Easy interface and excellent support! I recommend it.
"In my experience, most apps are useful but tens to make the user experience a bit more ""clunky."" However, this app is useful, has a clean appearance and improves the customer experience. Also, this app is extremely easy to install."
"Tom really went out of his way to help my store out before going to bed. It was a personalized experience in customer service - This app is exceptional because it allowed me to stack discounted upsells upon another and the interface looks so clean. The interface fit right into my store's theme. 10/10, I would recommend this app to my mentors and friends."
great sales popup app which doesn't slow down the site. Fast and fluid and great user interface.
"clear interface Great support - Andy solved the problem quickly, great! the app really helps
good! like!"
Simple instructions how to install. Clean interface and it's basically cost free for new webstores because you can have up to 5 currencies on your store without having to pay anything. Great Stuff!
"Nice, good working, interface fantastic!"
"Totally Awesome!
Have a shop? Need to translate? Look no more, Langify is the only app you'll need.
The app is perfect, its functions are easy and and the support is just amazing!
I sent an email for support at 2am and got an answer at 8h30, right in time to open the store, what more could you ask for? We use it in 4 languages for the moment and it is just so fluid and easy to translate the whole shop and the interface is fab!"
So far so Good. Easy interface ;)
"I can never rate these guys highly enough. Always helpful and superb service. The best of the best! Finally, a pop-up app that actually works and has a good interface so you can customise the design easily. Excellent work. Support is very fast and friendly."
the interface of this app is quite hard for the first time. however the support helped me in all my questions. Johnson helped me to make my site more beautiful. as I see settings of colors don't work yet
"really like APP, very easy to use and very friendly User Interface, recommend to each friend selling products in Shopify."
"Great App and outstanding support! We needed this app to launch multiple sites in different countries. I have launched many sites in my life in different languages and the interface of this app makes it very easy to translate every aspect of the site in a very efficient way. When we had an issue with something looking differently in one of the translated sites, Joahannes responded very fast and fixed the issue immediately. Recommend it to anyone who is serious about translating their site."
its awesome liek the interface..easy to install and the free versions works as well as the paid onea
"Awesome plug! 100% recommendation. 
Works fine and boost conversions. Sometimes bit annoying setting interface but its for free *****"
"I'm using Langify for quit a long time! And must say this is truly the best option if you need to add several languages to your store. Simple and user-friendly interface of the admin page, fast and really helpful support service. This guys can not only tell you what to do but they can do everything for you. Thank you guys for your work! 5 stars!"
"We've been using this app for several months, and generally, it's a good way to manage your loyalty program. It's easy to set-up and the interface is nicely designed. The biggest issue we have is the pricing tiers. There's a big jump from the first paid tier to the second, and our only reason for needing it is that they limit integrations to only 1 for the first tier. They should really rethink this limit, put an additional tier, or create a nominal upcharge if you need more. As it is, the first tier makes it hard to really get everything out of the app, and the second tier is just too expensive of a jump to make it worth it. Also, the advanced analytics is only available on the second paid tier. They should really rethink this as I may be willing to move up in price if I could fully see how the program is performing."
"Andy helped me out, super fast! It had an issue and it was taken care of in 5 minutes. Amazing. Fine app to work with i am in charge of what people see and the user experience is very good and easy. Thanks!"
super slow also app and support staff not worth it its just waste of time interface has so many bugs issue
"So easy to integrate, I went from 0 reviews to over 1000 in under 30 minutes. Review filter is great and the interface is very appealing. Kate helped me integrate the app with my theme perfectly and quickly."
"Easy interface and customer management. Having hiccups lately. Rewards points are being used and re-credited back to customer giving them endless point. Not happy right now and support takes a day + to get back to you. 
Anyone else having issues where the rewards are used for a purchase and instead of being deducted from the customer's reward account, they go right back on it. I'm waiting for support but wanted to know if we're alone here. Our customers are shopping and getting free rewards dollars. icky"
"Absolutely my favourite app on Shopify. We were on the Smilie.io free plan for a few months, and it was fantastic for our business. 
Rewards (no matter how little) are a hugely successful way to incentivise purchases and increase AOV - and Smile does Rewards like magic.  
The functionality is brilliant - with the countless ways to Earn and Redeem Rewards and the Smile interface is beautifully simple. 
We are currently on the Started plan, and I hope to move to Growth once our business grows to allow it. 
Highly recommended."
Very good app! It does what it suppose to and works very well! Clean and easy to understand interface
"This app has the most beautiful user interface and graphics I highly recommend it to anyone, thanks to great customer service from andy"
We are still new to the app and checking out the features at the free level for our customer.  The user interface is simple and easy to use.  I look forward to learning more about how this level of service can help us get started with providing our customers with a rewarding shopping experience.
"J'ai pris l'application pour pouvoir installer sur ma boutique en ligne une barre de message (livraison gratuite) : très facile! Super.
Dommage qu'il faille prendre la formule payante pour avoir la sélection des pays, car je ne pratique la livraison gratuite qu'en France :(
J'ai détourné le problème en précisant mon message. Du coup, c'est parfait.
Pour une complète débutante comme moi, l'interface est accessible et simple d'utilisation. Merci !"
"Amazing support and their interface , i love their support they always reply very quickly and they keep on adding new functionalities."
"I appreciate companies that allow free plans for start up companies. Afterall, we all started somewhere at first. They respond to questions quickly and the interface is very professional."
"I’ve used this app for 3 months on the 50$/month plan. It looked like a great concept at first, but for such a high price it lacks several important features (or only makes them available on a 200$/month plan) :
There is no analytics or any kind of way to view how customers spend their points (or if they even do) on the 50$ plan.
A major feature that’s also missing is the integration with emailing apps to allow customers to redeem points by subscribing to the newsletter. That should be a top feature for any kind of rewards system.
The interface is too limited, with very few customization possibilities. I understand it has to be user-friendly, but this is oversimplified. The intrusive popup widget gets old really fast. If it was a fairly new app I’d understand, but they’ve been around for years and should have had improved by now.
The support is alright which is why I’m still giving it 3 stars, but overall I don’t feel like this is worth the cost."
"I downloaded and upgraded to a paid plan because I'm using Klaviyo and Klaviyo sent me this awesome presentation about how loyalty programs are the best ways for vendors to keep growing their sales. Smile was the program they suggested and is already integrated with. Without questioning it further, I enrolled in Smile thinking that I would enjoy most of the benefits. I (WAS initially) very unhappy that part of the apps capabilities is only available to the stores that spend higher subscription plans.  My initial review expressed this and this outstanding company really puts customers first.  I was contacted by their customer service privately and they assisted me in a workaround that allowed me to get the results I was looking for with my budget. 
What an outstanding company and platform this is. This was a lesson to me as a business owner, of the importance and value that customer service has in customer retention and satisfaction. Even if a customer is unhappy with your product, providing outstanding customer support that is fast and solution oriented truly enhances the customer experience and brings loyalty.  So this is the only part of my review that I needed to change. I believe that had I contacted support with my concerns before leaving the review, they would have assisted me in making the app work for me in a way that I needed.  I will leave the last paragraph that follows this one the same as it was a part of my original review and I stand by that perspective that the Smile app is truly exceptional and a great product for any store to grow its sales and have success. 
I wanted to add, that besides the functions I want not being a part of their basic smaller plans, the entire system of Smile is extremely user friendly, very aesthetically pleasing and provides ample documentation on implementing and growing a loyalty rewards program. Their customer support is very helpful and you can reach someone in real time using the chat bot on the user interface. That would make this a 5 star app but at my level it only deserves 3 stars comparing to my other app. If I upgrade to the Growth plan it will definitely deserve 5+ stars. So for anyone with the budget and doesn't mind, this app is more than a great one."
"This app is overpriced for its lack of function, the support is slow and limited, even for a paid plan and the interface is hard to understand for us and our customers. We've also experienced customers not being able to login or view points. I REALLY regret choosing Smile for our loyalty program. We've been operating not knowing our customer referral links weren't activated. And this is after our Smile account rep reviewed everything before we went live. The program also lacks basic things you should be able to do within a loyalty program. We cant assign free shipping to certain tiers for VIP customers without them entering code. This means if they want to use a another code or purchase during a sale, they have to decide between free shipping or the discount. How does a loyalty program not allow free shipping to certain customer segments?  It's also not possible to allow special treats for your rewards program. We'd like to offer special items but cant because the reward products in smile have to be available in your store. Also, loyalty login is only available via a pop which gets crowed if you have a support chat pop up or even an email pop up. I hate I spent so much time trying to make this work. We've been trying to resolve login issues for a week now with no resolve. And no one from Smile wants to take responsibility despite Shopify and our theme developer telling us the issue has to be with Smile. Pass on this app. And if you decide to do it, it's not necessary to pay extra for the account rep support when setting up. They don't really make things any easier to understand."
"The tech support helps me a lot to set up the code, and this is going to save time. the interface is very clean and easy to navigate I recommend it"
"Very good user interface and customer service, right when I signed up I got help from a very helpful supports person, Lisa. Would reccomend."
"Super easy to setup, looks very professional, very intuitive user interface. When i scale i will surely upgrade to paid plan. Highly recommended app"
GREAT APP!! IT REALLY MAKES THE PROCESS EASY OF MAKING A SHIPPING BAR. SMOOTH INTERFACE AS WELL. THANK YOU!
"Really great Loyalty/Rewards app. It's easy to use, great interface, simple design, and I love how intuitive it is to manage and for customers too. I wanted to integrate with another app and contacted Support to help and Elli was kind enough to add an extra app to our account. Thank you Elli and Smile for making such a great app. Highly recommended addition to any e-comm store!"
It does everything it promises with ease. The interface is user friendly I recommend it to everyone starting up.
"This app is a MUST HAVE for all e-commerce store owners that want to take their customer's user experience to the next level with customized rewards program. 
Not only that, the fact that they have customer support chat using another one of our favorite apps (Intercom.io) is a plus. Shoutout to Kellen and Maggie for the great support! :-)

"Updating my review - this app is very expensive, but they have solid features and helpful support. I picked their brain very annoyingly and they were good. The UI/UX of the interface for both the customer and store owner is solid. 
I can't say whether this increases repeat business/drives new business. But they've done a good job creating what they set out to create. I haven't used this long enough to attest to its effectiveness. Although from a price perspective if I have a few thousand customers my pricing is going to be around $400 - $500 per month if not more. That's a lot. Will i be able to get more than $6k per year in new revenue from this app? Would love to see a lower price point."
I love this app it has a very easy and seamless interface. With a small fee of ten dollars a month I see no reason to not invest in this service.
"Update: I gave it one star because I left a 5 star review for another app that costs 10x less a month and has far more functionality than smile.io does. I wish they made a loyalty app. There really is no excuse to charge companies predatory pricing for basic functions.
We had previously given it two stars as it does collect points and integrates with the apps we require. 
We needed the API, so to get that functionality it is EXTREMELY expensive. 
We are paying $600 USD a month (I understand to get the API now it's worse - starting at $1000 USD a month).
We'd switch to another tool in a heartbeat if it could sync with the apps we require. In this day and age, to 'firewall' integrations & API's is just not playing nice.
I hate that it has a pop-up portal for the points. We already have a customer support one, so it is confusing for customers. 
The customer interface is also not nearly as customizable as you'd expect for the price. We should have full branding control at the price we pay. We should be able to control the portal & make it page, or embed it in the customer account page.
I also wish the points were fully integrated into the checkout for single & recurring orders, with prompts and customization. For the ridiculous amount we are paying, you'd think it would. But no. We are paying for what should be a $59/month app.
Customer support is ok. But again, for the price we are paying, I really expect to have live chat customer support available - not an email back in a day or two.
Positive: It integrates nicely with reviews, our crm, subscriptions, VIP, etc. and it is very stable. 
All in all, it does work. If you have simple needs, it's probably a great tool. For us, we just feel stuck with it, it's far too much money, and we wouldn't recommend it."
I love this app it has a very easy and seamless interface. With a small fee of ten dollars a month I see no reason to not invest in this service.
"Love this app for so many reason. Intelligently use Shopify's admin interface, easy of user, many options for the price. This app, however, could be even better if the referral can take more than just first time referral. Extend the referral commission than it would be an enterprise app"
Absolutely incredible. I've never had such an easy experience with support ever. Flawless user interface and one of the most powerful marketing tools out there.
"Love this app, it's simple to use and has a clean interface. Also realized that i could customize the review box and made one that compliments my site properly! Thank uou for this awesome app!"
great app. super easy and accessible interface allows customisation for stores. perfect for reviews and testimonials.
"Works as intended, no annoying pricing gates, very simple user experience and has worked flawlessly for a long time for me."
This is a great program.  The interface is very intuitive and well designed.  We have used a few different apps but this one stands out!
This app is awesome! I used the install service and it was done prompt and well. The interface is well done and very easy to navigate. You can tell this company has a lot of experience in creating quality apps. A++++
"Fiz o teste do Loox e aderi ao plano, super fácil de mexer e tem uma interface muito boa, indico o app. Ajuda muito nos depoimentos para os clientes!!!"
"I've had Personalizer installed for a few months, and around 10% of my store's revenue is coming through it. That's a great return on the investment, even taking into account that some customers may have found the products and bought them through the regular interface anyway. It's kind of amazing that Shopify doesn't have this functionality built in - maybe they should buy Limespot. ;) I found the installation straightforward and it's working well with the Venture template.

The Smile.io team worked with us to create a rewards plan that worked for our Shopify store. They responded to requests and questions quickly and helped get us up and running. The Smile.io app interface is easy to understand and navigate for users that aren't technical. Many thanks!
"After careful scrutiny, I chose Smile.io for our rewards program. The new interface has improved tremendously and I receive very few questions from my customers about how to earn and redeem rewards. I have seen the direct benefits of retention. And the basic version is FREE???!!! It's a no-brainer. 
The main point of this review is to recognize Elli from the support team for helping me through a bind - I had updated to a new theme with a bug of ridiculous code that blocked all apps from working. 3 other app developers couldn't figure it out and Elli pinpointed the issue and helped me fix it. Now everything works perfectly - those other apps should buy Elli a coffee :) Thank you THANK YOU!
My one request for future app functionality would be to find a way to prevent referral fraud - almost everyone who has used our $10 referral incentive has used it on the same household or a secondary email address.
Keep up the great work team!"
"super recomendo , app muito produtivo.
interface simples de usar ! perfeito podem  confiar neste app!"
The more we dug into the app the more impressed we were with the app. 100% worth installing. Love the interface and all the options! Game changer.
"we are a small store (10-15000 visits per month, a few thousand customers). The launcher, without an intent page has murdered my conversion rate. The points don't show on my customer account page, so I cannot promote the service to customers, without losing them via the terrible UX and limited positioning of the launcher. My only alternative to provide proper is to pay 600 a month, which I'll get no return on and cannot afford to invest in with a customer list only in the 1000s. It feels like a honey trap / bait and switch tactic. Fundamental user experience requirements should absolutely be a prerequisite for a paid app.
There's a lot of great functionality in there, but not one I'm willing to take a 40% conversion drop on new business, especially with Shopify itself being so limited in its design flexibility out of the box. I'm not willing to plough dev resources into solving problems that ae solvable out of the box. As a consequence, I've decided to accept any reputational damage from halting the programme while I try to find a suitable alternative.
Take a look by contrast at the flexibility of positioning of surveys and polls etc on a solution like Hotjar - it manages to be both visible and unobtrusive. (it's a different type of ap, but the launcher is near perfect and still carries their branding on the lower plans, which is fine)
It's a shame, because otherwise I was 100% bought in to your journey and the functions you offer, but the pricing plan vs feature set doesn't feel like advantages when moving through the plans, it feels  like blackmail, leveraged against my own promotion to customers and desire to provide a good service offering to my customers.
I wish I'd read more before I committed - the sales patter doesn't match the experience of using this properly. I'm sure it's fine if you're fishing around with a free plan and not on top of your user stats. I am on top of mine and unfortunately, an otherwise excellent app is destroyed by the simplest oversight in UX - classic case of a developer thinking of themselves without considering an end user."
"The best review app ever, the most customizable and easy friendly interface. Little laggy but compared to Loox, way more free stuff you get for a BASIC. i mean this thing charges for 100 products as many reviews as you want, unlike Loox does 20 reviews per unlimited products. Yes you have to copy and paste the code for some stuff to work, but hey for the price and everything they offer, its a Winner. Thank you guys."
"I received the recommendation from a Shopify representative and I was very pleased from the beginning from the wealth of features and the wise possibilities, plus the comfortable pricing plan.
In my previous position I have designed similar interfaces myself what make me appreciate your system even more. Last but not least, the great communication and customer service: Wealth of information, problem solving, care for new features needs and even a specific adjustment for my needs.
Thank you!"
The interface is visually simple but powerful once you're using it.
"Amazing!
I had previously run Personal Recommendations and Sales Boost.  I like the Beeketing team but just wasn't seeing any results.  And the %-of-revenue model is great at the beginning but very pricey as you scale.  Also hard to verify their conversions.
I implemented Limespot and within 24 hours had my first confirmed upsell.  Another day later and another confirmed one.  I'll blow through my 3xmonthly free trial in a few days.  
Customer support is also amazing.  Ryanna has been very helpful and responsive.
My only minor nit is the admin ui.  Very full of options and data. Very busy.  By no means a big deal.  And lo and behold, Ryanna told me this morning that a much cleaner interface will be rolled out shortly.  Voila!  
I highly recommend the product and the team.

"Muffin does a great job at what she does, definitely a positive user experience. Looking forward to using this app."
i like the app it has easy interface plus you can do so many cool things with the app itself. i hope i increase my sales soon
Customer support has been very responsive so far to fix all the minor glitches and to make sure everything is working as intended. Back end user interface is also easy to navigate!
"I found this app to be very hard to set-up yourself, and the customer service department is based in the USA from what I can see. They only work 9-5 and do not work weekends. If you have a problem it can take days to be fixed. I would not install this app if I was you. There are much better SEO apps out there. I cannot explain how disappointed I was with my experience. Problem after problem, my web ranking also dropped quite a lot as well. You have been warned. A message to SEO Booster, you come across as lazy and that you do not care about your customer experience, either do this properly or find another business. Your interface looks five years out of date compared to other SEO apps. My only upside was that you have a link to uninstall you code so I do not have to also uninstall zombie code, that was the ONLY good thing about your app. Stop saying your customer service is great, and actually make it great. Also bring your interface into the modern time, not 2015."
"Smile is an easy to install solution for a reliable rewards program on your Shopify Store. In addition, the support is excellent! They have a chat box on your app interface and help arrives right away every time. Maggie helped me today and did a terrific job answering questions and providing reports I needed. Thanks!"
I'm a 6-figure seller and this simple but effective app helps me announce my valuable shipping deals throughout my site...I highly recommend it. Simple interface too!
Easy to set up and use. The clean interface is a plus!
"Easy interface, ton of great features to use to get more customers. This is the best app for photos reviews whether you are dropshipper or not."
"Awesome customer service and customization during the initial setup. I really enjoy the new user experience and have already seen an increase in time spent on the site by customers. 
Update-
Needed more customizations to our new website theme and Olivia absolutely crushed it. Our site looks great and the process was easy. Definitely get this app if you want to be a better version of yourself:)."
"Excellent free tier. Offers tons of customization with easy to use interface. You can customize colors, animations, text, custom scripts. 5 Stars!"
"Fantastic user experience, easy to setup and seamless integration with Mailchimp and Yotpo. Very impressed."
"*UPATED*
Recurring issue with recommendations not showing currencies correctly so effectively pricing all recommendations incorrectly, i.e higher. 4 emails to support and we have no fix and no reply from development. We are on a premium Plus plan and being charged accordingly - out of frustration have uninstalled and moved on. Appalling service at a premium price.
*Original Review*
It's a good app and does convert for us. Would rate higher if the interface was less complex."
"We've tried a bunch of apps and this is the best there is for showcasing related product items/accessories. Nice, clean interface with a host of configuration options. We did run into a multi-currency issue but they were more than happy to fix it for us at no charge. All around thumbs up!"
simple and easy to use app. The interface is clear and self explanatory and very easy to navigate for beginners
"Great App, easy to use!!! the interface is user friendly great for mobile. Highly recommended !!! :)"
Easy to use and super straightforward interface!

This app is great for launching a loyalty program for your store! Very easy to use interface as well.
"The app works great, would highly recommend this app to anyone who needs customer photos to add value to their site. easy to use interface, good team support, blah blah blah.... in short worth it must recommended."
"Easy to use,and good interface! Really, just an amazing app, that anybody can use. And really helpful."
Great app. I really liked it. Recommend for everybody. Flexible settings. Intuitive interface. Everything is simple and clear.
Great Interface. Fairly easy to set up. Learned a lot.
"After having some glitches with the integration with my POS, the sweet tooth staff put in an extra effort to help me out and make it work for our shop!!!  With the glitches fixed, it should work absolutely perfect!  Sweet tooth ended up being easy to work with, understanding, and extremely accommodating.  It is clear they are trying to provide customer's with the best support and make their app as user friendly and as functional as possible!
Sweet tooth's interface is easy to use, its simple to install, and the customer interface is equally user friendly.  Our shop is excited to utilize this app to encourage repeat customers and reward or frequent shoppers!
Thank you Sweet Tooth!  I appreciate all of the help you have given me the last couple of days!"
Its pretty nice. I havent used it too much but will soon. I like it because the interface is smooth...
"Absolutely brilliant product, service, pricing system and user experience!"
"To be honest, I forgot I signed up for a free trial with this app and all of a sudden - my sales were going up. I had no idea why. I thought it was because I started doing Facebook & Instgram ads but when I looked at my referral traffic, it seemed low to translate into that many sales! So I figured I must be mis-reading the data or something must be broken. Now the mystery is solved! This app has had a positive impact on the user experience for my website's visitors and I will 100% be keeping them for this website and my other websites as well! And may I add that Marc was absolutely amazing in guiding me through the portal and explaining everything!  A BIG THANK YOU!!"
Testing the app now. So far so good. Interface and setting menu is simple to understand and use. Great job.
"Love this app! The interface is super easy to use and their customer support team is awesome!! The ""Related Items"" looks great on my website!"
really nice design interface and heaps of options! Petey provided good customer service and fast replies. Hightly recommend
"Set up very easy, lovely user friendly interface that's made for real people - nicely done Sweet Tooth!  However it's disappointing that you can't edit some really basic colour choices as part of the 'customise' process...unless you upgrade of course!!  Almost deleted the App when I realised this as I feared the whole 'Free' thing would have too many limitations.  But, persevered largely because of the positive reviews for the free version... In terms of how well it works we'll have to wait and see what happens!  Fingers crossed...."
"Easy setup, nice interface. Very customizable"
Great app. It is actually improving our sales and helps us providing a better user experience in our site
So far the interface is very simple and user friendly with many flexible options to improve user loyalty and to expand our customer base.
If you are having issues with SEO I recommend this app. It helps improve SEO optimization and has a very easy to use interface. Highly recommend it!
A amazing app to up your SEO game. Has a user friendly interface and an impressive analysis on fixing SEO issues.
I added this app to help me emphasis free shipping on my site. It has a very easy to use interface with a variety of customizable options so the design blends in with my site.
"My first ever review. I set this thing up in like 10 seconds. Could have been faster, however i had to scroll for 9 seconds. 
Leaving 5 star for the easy use interface and for the free plan to be so good!"
"VEERY HELPFUL. IF YOU ARE A BEGINNER, IT'S THE BEST ONE YOU CAN USE. EASY TO USE. EASY INTERFACE! NOTHING BETTER"
"Very flexible and useful little app. There are unforeseen benefits, like knowing how much clicking has been going on in a day per page & type of product, and the interface is nice, in that you can change a lot of aspects to suit your store."
"One of the easiest, most useful and jaw-dropping apps I've ever installed. Interface is perfect, design is perfect, everything is perfect!
Thanks :) :) :)"
Very easy to get started. All that complexity is expertly hidden behind a truly delightful user interface.
"User friendly interface and very easy for import or select the reviews on AliExpress. Now, my site looks much better and more trustworthy with the reviews."
so far so good. The app has a great interface and very functional and operational.
"Very nice interface. So easy to install. Products are displayed very nicely and fit my store perfectly. Limespot is also very easy to customize. We tried several other similar app but this one outperformed all of them by a lot. It was a no brainer to use Limespot,"
"Sweet Tooth has been exceeding our expectations with its conversions, customer support and simplicity.  One of the features that we enjoy is the analytics, which was what won us over.
The interface is simple to use, and the program automatically generates rewards for our customers so we don't have to worry about monitoring the process. 
We definitely recommend giving this application a shot and chat with their sales team to lock in a plan that works best for you!"
"Great app - easy to spot issues and improve SEO, site performance and google ranking. Super easy to use, very intuitive and simple interface."
"I used the FSB app to create a free shipping bar. I love how fast and easy the app was to use! I'm very busy so I don't like time consuming apps that force me to spend an hour learning how to use the app, just to perform a 5 minute task. I didn't have that problem with the FSB app- it was super user-friendly which allowed me to stay on task and move forward to my next project quickly and with ease!  FSB deserves a 5-Star rating for the great end-user experience- Well done! Thank you."
"Love the app, it is exactly what i wanted and it is FREE, i like the interface and it is easy to understand"
This is simply the best and easiest SEO app I have ever used! It is very straightforward and comprehensive and saves a ton of tedious work with its easy to use interface all in one place. I'm sure it will prove to be profitable for my business when I finish fine-tuning its features and I would highly recommend it to any ecommerce site.
"Searching for a Rewards Program ?  I suggest Sweet Tooth based on the easy to use APP interface.  I never install an APP until I reach out to the APP provider to see how quickly the response time is.  Sweet Tooth has you covered here offering online chat and fast response times... Thanks Ellie and Abbey @Sweet Tooth for always offering great advice, ideas, and support.  The beginner free plan is great to get you started with zero risk or investment until you start generating customers and sales.  How great to start your first 500 customers for free ?
We also use the Shopify POS system and Sweet Tooth Rewards integrates seamlessly.  Never crashes and easy display of each customer and points balance.  What a great way to keep your customers coming back for more....
A good Rewards system provides a level of gamification encouraging customers to build their points balance to reap discounts but what really attracted me to this APP was the Rewards a customer can earn for Promoting your site.  Share on Facebook, Twitter, or customer referrals ?  How much value can you put on an APP that promotes others to market for you with a simple click to share ?  This can potentially bring 1000's of visitors to your site that you didn't have before.... Not only that but Rewarding Customers on their Birthday with a coupon or rewards bonus adds an element of personalization as well as a reminder to say "" Hey come visit our site "".  Sweet Tooth automates the marketing for you.... No more sending emails and wasting your precious time.
Setup is easy, support is there to guide you through anything you have a question on.
You can even log in to add rewards to a customers balance manually or edit their points balance in any way you prefer..... Changing from your old site to your new site ?  Add your old customers and give them a bonus points balance to visit your new site.... Its easy and builds your followers to continue shopping with you over a competitor.
We also use Sweet Tooth to reward first time visitors or existing customers for writing product reviews or posting a creative response on our company blog.  On Free version this can be done manually on their paid plan its implemented in Shopify Reviews.  I actually give a rewards amount based on how well the review is written so the better the content written the more we reward.  So we may give 5 points for a short sentence review, but if a customer writes a descriptive paragraph pointing out product details and benefits.....well then its just like you paid a creative writer to do the sale for you!  This we would reward 50 points and call it an A+ Review bonus !  You can be very creative using this app and Sweet Tooth thought of it all.
Honestly if you have an Ecommerce site, implementing a Rewards APP is a no brainer.  It can only grow your business larger.
Try it you won't be disappointed !  
One click install, stable, great support and takes little time to setup your Rewards system.
I hope this helps to all you Shopifiers getting started if your wondering if a Rewards APP is really something you need or not.  Trust me you need it !

So far so good...I'll leave updates later as the integration continues.  I do like the interface and the one click method
Amazing interface and support! Abby was extremely helpful in solving any issue that I had. This is the number 1 go to application for the Loyalty Program for your website.
"Good app, good ROI, easier interface for me compare with other famous review app.
I have delete it and try others, then I came back for it."
"Amazing application with a beautiful interface! The free version does restrict a few important features, which should have been available in limit, but otherwise, the functionalities provided are better than any loyalty extension out there."
This app is so convenient. The interface is really easy to use and the reviews load fast. I love it !
"Loving it, great user interface, and the integration, but the automatic change of languages and some other things should be great. Really No SPANISH SUPPORT?? like my store is in mexico city...."
Great easy to use and the user interface has been great and I will give this one more time a great review
"Andy was very responsive to all my questions. Resolved my issues in no time. I also love the app! Great interface and customer service! Also, had some issue and another customer service agent named Kate did an excellent job as well!"
Great tool and easy to use intuitive interface!
"The interface is great and setting up products is a piece of cake. I really wanted to be able to use this for all our custom clothing. However, it doesn't adjust when distributors' items are out of stock, so that forces you to refund a customer order if out of stock. That comes off as really unprofessional and made my business look bad, not to mention losing a sale. While customer service was very responsive, they had no fix for this issue.
Edit -  I'm taking this review from 3 stars to 2. This company has the strangest way of dealing with mediocre reviews. I told them precisely what the issue is (inability to predict when an item is out of stock), they told me they had no fix for the issue, I told them I wouldn't be able to use Printify anymore. They THEN sent an email asking me to remove my review or change it to a higher rating because ""I believe I have covered every area of concern you had.""  They in no way addressed my concern other than saying they can't do anything about it. I'm very surprised they asked me to remove a review when the underlying issue still exists!
Here is the customer service response to the out-of-stock issue:
""You mentioned that you would like us to incorporate a system that automatically accounts for out of stock items and/or variants.  I completely agree that that would be ideal.  When it comes to items that are out of stock, we only find out when our print providers notify us.  We have been in discussions with them lately trying to work out an effective system to notify our merchants when these issues occur. This is an issue we have been addressing and I can assure you that we are woking on an acceptable solution.
For now, our policy concerning out of stock items is as follows...
For temporary out of stock issues, no notice will be sent out.  We expect these issues to be dealt with quickly and will be only a minor inconvenience.  For out of stock matters that will be more lengthy, we will send out an email to all our merchants notifying you of the issue so you can make the necessary adjustments to your account.  
I totally understand that in some cases this can lead to some inconveniences.  I would like to assure you that we are committed to finding a solution.  Your patience and understanding are appreciated."""
"This app is great so far, I like the interface and the options that it has."
"Easy to use and great looking interface both at the frontend and backend. 
A bit high priced but highly recommended for the features and look provided.
We use them on our website.

"Wide variety of products, easy interface, good prices.  As a designer I enjoy the way they make it easy to create and ship to costumers."
I recently added the Printify App and am happy with it so far. The interface is easy to use and they have a wide variety of products. I appreciate being able to select vendors that are closest to my location to reduce shipping times.
"It is not the best user interface and it is confusing to have to sync its products. I think this is very time consuming. I am in Europe and have my customer group there and my customers are not happy when they order a T-shirt and it goes about 30 days before they get it, even though I have designed a T-shirt in the EU.
But they are good at answering and helping."
"We've been with Printify for about a year and a half now, and have been very satisfied with them. We looked at some of the other print-on-demand companies as well, but ultimately chose to go with Printify because of their low prices and high reviews. I can now say that their customer service is top notch, their prices are in fact very competitive, and the intuitive interface and seamless Shopify integration makes it extremely easy to use. I'm very pleased!"
"Little pricey for my liking, but the consolation is that it works flawlessly. The interface is user-friendly, and generally, the app has been designed really well."
All going great so far! The interface is very user-friendly.
"Waiting to see how it works, but will update review as soon as I know. Asked for review upon install ... So since I'm not sure what I'll like or not like, I'll leave this here. However, i do, so far, like the ease of the interface."
"Printify and the team itself is great. I love the interface. My 1 start has to do with their print providers. I've spent far too much time and effort building the foundation for a successful store, only to have the print quality of the products be absolute crap. Will be moving everything over to Printful. Hope this saves someone time, effort and money because that's what using this app has cost me so far."
"Very quickly, I don't have to wait long, I'm very satisfied with your service. Very friendly program, modern interface, very easy to manipulate."
"I create fine art and then create print-on-demand products, of all sorts, for my online gallery and store. Having just started this business, I have yet to see a final product from Printify, so I cannot speak to the quality of the products themselves. What I can say is this: the interface for creating print-on-demand products, with Printify, is the most user-friendly I have tried, which is appreciated. That allows me to focus more on making art and less time fussing with creating the final products that will have my art on them! Also, Printify's customer care/service is SUPERB. They will work hard to insure that your products are the best they can be and they listen when a creator/store owner/customer has exceptions that need facilitating. WELL done, Printify!"
"Printify has an excellent variety of products. I particularly like the boots, sneakers, dresses, bedding, swimsuits, flip-flops, and bath mats and shower curtains. 
They have excellent timely and friendly email support response and chats; and they have a helpful blog, including videos and tips.
Their catalog is easy to navigate, their product-builder not only includes a user-friendly interface but they’ve added a layer of accuracy for typing in values for x and y positioning, image size percentages, and rotation angles. Very helpful for laying out the shoe templates.
They also include location information of their print providers as well as extra product information -- Key Features, Care Instructions -- to add to your product descriptions.
Printify integrates seamlessly with Shopify, but they also allow for sample purchases and provide tracking. I ordered and received samples of ornaments, duffle bags, pillows, and duvets and they are all high-quality, and I love them all! The feet of the socks are too long for a size eight woman but fit a size 11 man — note: the whites look a little gray, I’d recommend staying away from white on the socks.
Overall, I have zero complaints, only great admiration and high expectations for doing business with this vendor. Thank you, Printify!"
"A lot of (pod) companies say they are great for start up businesses. But these guys really are. Their site is easy to navigate, add and edit products and a centralized interface to view orders and products and sales. One of their greatest accomplishments is their great customer service! As merchants dealing with print on demands we often run into issues somewhere in the supply and demands chain but printify does a Superb job at minimizing those issues with quick and satisfactory resolution. 
The only con is they may have less products for customization than custom cat. But their app is much better. I only wish I could continue to afford the premium plan but recently medical issues came with medical bills.
But I literally love the guys and gals over at printify so please if you're looking for a good POD app with great customer and consumer service then look no further."
"Printify is by far my favorite POD service. They offer multiple suppliers, very reasonable prices, and super easy user interface."
"Printify is by far my favorite POD service. They offer multiple suppliers, very reasonable prices, and super easy user interface."
"Good app and easy to use. Mockup interface is user friendly. You can create unique products in few seconds, even shoes! see it in action at www.runit365.com"
Free and helpful user interface. Let's see if the changes help and i'll come back and update the review!
"This is a must have App! Easy to use, great interface and definitely excited to see the return business it brings."
Awesome app - they took no time hesitating to fix up the color scheme of the Review interface to match my store's.
the interface was very simple and well laid out it was also very easy to navigate along with very clear descriptions
Good app with simple interface. Like that they have free plan and in some cases you don't even have to pay to use it.
"A GREAT WAY TO LOSE CUSTOMERS & DESTROY YOUR BUSINESS'S REPUTATION
Shopify solicits/integrates reviews into their platform when someone attempts to place an order. Thus, the majority of positive reviews here are from people who haven't fully utilized the service but are either setting up a shop or are placing their sample orders after being wow'd by Printify's nicer user interface.
I used to do a lot of business with Printify. There were issues at the start as Printify was still finding its footing but the product quality was great and the customer service was relatively responsive even if not always the quickest to resolve issues. There were some minor struggles to get things properly handled but Printify gradually improved to the point where things were running relatively smoothly... until they didn't. 
Something at Printify changed. Most items were suddenly not only much slower to ship but frequently shipped extremely late. Store sync features literally destroyed my website multiple times over. I moved all of my business elsewhere and several years on I couldn't be happier with the other services. 
Every once in a while I return to Printify... either lured in by new product offerings or attempting to fill custom orders for specific items not offered by my primary services. After all, while I don't think I'd ever trust them to sync to my store again, the quality itself was initially great and all appearances are that the service has improved... a better range of products & options, more vendors, great stated Average Production Times... I fall for it every time.
A large percentage of these orders have had issues. Many of the orders have not only shipped well beyond the stated Average Production Time but after SLA. A week+ for products with '2.15' day stated averages not been uncommon. Some shipments, including some which were late, have arrived with poor quality, damaged or wholly incorrect items. 
Worse, even when they ultimately resolve the issues, customer service still no longer appears to be a priority. Messages of ""This item has been 'in production' for over a week, could you please check with the vendor to determine the issue?"" can illicit little to no response. In some cases it has required multiple contacts when an item still hasn't shipped or the issue hasn't been addressed to get a meaningful response.
These things happen with any business, even the good ones, issues arise, glitches happen, things slip through the cracks. You address them accordingly and, if applicable, learn from them and make  changes and improvements. In my observation, Printify has ceased doing this. Instead seeking to rest on existing status/positive reviews and clean up or bury the negative rather than addressing issues with the business itself. 
It's sad to say but at this point I can't recommend strongly enough that others consider alternative services. Your customers won't know and thus won't thank you but your profits and stress level certainly will. 
Further, things appear to have declined to a point where Shopify should really poll users who have the app installed about their experiences and consider either removing Printify or giving them a probationary period to demonstrate & maintain legitimate improvement. Any business which positions itself between you & your customer and then doesn't keep its commitments or seek to provide adequate service to either is not engaging in good faith.
** An Update **
My final order with Printify: No response from customer service for 3 days. Left this feedback and within hours the CEO was repeatedly calling my cellphone and their Business Development Manager sent an email. A day later (Saturday) customer service sent their first response. They wrote again on Monday to say that the order had shipped (12 business days in production). A week later the customer reported that the order wasn't received. Lo and behold, DHL is showing the order was never actually shipped..."
"Great application, really easy to use, simple user experience and pretty decent amount of customization in the FREE version. Keep up the good job you guys!"
Incredibly easy to set up and a beautiful interface. Very excited to start using this app!
So far so good!  Very nice and clean interface and it works as it says.  I am using the free version and it is perfect for what I need!  Thank You!!!
"I love it! So complete and the User Interface is really great and easy to understand. I will use it definitely in my shop!
Please add: ability to add less than 4 stars (3,2,1) and ability to reply to reviews from customer service (like add a comment under the review)"
"UNE TRES BONNE APPLI POUR LES AVIS CLIENTS, JE SUIS TRES SATISFAIT. TOUT EST BIEN PENSE ET UNE BONNE INTERFACE"
Extremely user friendly interface and Sweet Tooth has increased my repeat customer percentage! We love it!
"Great interface, and extremely easy to use."
"It helps to boost repeat customers and make them loyalty customer.
Interface is friendly and easy to use."
"great app, a lot of content and easy on the eye interface"
Still no orders but user interface and fulfillment give promise.
great app and very easy interface :)
"Great app. Keep up the good work, and maybe just update the User Interface for creating products."
"STAY AWAY from
Printify unless you want to waste your time and screw over your customers.
Ordered SAMPLES from Printify. First order came 12 days late and smelled horribly of fumes. I was concerned about the delay, but figured to give them a second try.
Ordered a SECOND batch of samples, this time from two suppliers (the same as before an a new one). Suppliers A product arrived in time, but I wanted to throw up upon opening the bag the fumes were so bad. Washed the shirt inside out, and the design pealed right off. Told Prinity, replaces arrived about a week later. No fumes, but definitely not as high a quality print either.
The second printer “had to replace their machinery” and the order would be over 14 days late. When it arrived, a wrong item in the wrong color was sent. Still waiting to hear back from Printify on when this can be rectified, but 30 days after my second order of SAMPLES, I still have useless products that have not been fulfilled correctly.
In general their support has been good, but it’s clear emails are being answered in a queue. Twice, I’ve had quick responses from employees who have CLEARLY not read the above comments.
In terms of an app - their interface can’t be beat. I get that there are growing pains, and as a company, they seem to be trying to address them.
But if you care about your customers, you need to stay away for at LEAST six months. Give them time to figure out which of their suppliers can actually meet the need - before YOU ruin YOUR reputation with constant complains and returns."
"I've been using Printify for a month now and already had some orders fulfilled with them. Print quality is top-notch and their customer support was very prompt and helpful to answer my questions. They have the biggest selection of products from apparels to home decors, phone cases, and the prices are very competitive. I've acquired a Business account with them and gettin 20% off on all my orders. I've used other apps like Printful, TeeLaunch, but I like Printify most for its user-friendly interface and quality service they provide. YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING!! KEEP IT UP!!!"
"The interface is easy to use. But don't be fooled. I ordered samples and then turned everything off I spent time building. I was glad I did order them; although, the customer service was not helpful. They ended up refunding ""as goodwill"" items that were done incorrectly. Policy is to remake only. Printing is awful with most vendors, or cheap fabrics, or worse, chemical smells that don't go away. they never understood that this all represents my brand to my customers and it just wasn't good enough. When I said the product came in with sticky residue all over the shirt, they said, "" wash it."" Because I hadn't thought of that? I just don't want it delivered like this to my customer. In the end I gave up trying to get help or understanding. I turned off the app and decided to share my review. Make some products, order some samples, decide for yourself."
So far I really like it! The interface for designing is easy and fast. Provides really nice photos. I like that I can choose suppliers. I can list the same product but offer it to be shipped either from the US or the UK! I hope the shipping is quick and the customer service is on par with the usability.
"Excellent user interface. I'm no designer, so this mockup generator really convinced me that starting a shop is going to be easy as pie. I was able to create a product in less than a minute. 
When I first got this idea to start an ecommerce shop I was convinced this was only for the pros. I was worried I was going to run into loads of hurdles, but Shopify and Printify make starting a business seem like child's play.
I was about to start researching printing companies, thinking about asking my mother-in-law if I could use her garage to store products before shipping them. All the headache of finding a supplier for apparel, deciding how much stock to order, fulfilling minimum order quantity requirements, sending orders to the printers, buying packaging, bringing goods to the post office and more... all gone.
The only issue I had was with the resolution of my artwork and something about product variation limits. But their customer care agent got back to me pretty quickly and it was immediately clear that it was a real person who was genuinely committed to helping me without making me feel stupid.
It turns out, that limit is set by Shopify and I'll just have to make sure my designer gets the resolution right before I start publishing anything to my shop. I want the best quality products, so I'm glad they warned me about this one.
All-in-all I'm pretty satisfied. I'll see how things go as I get my shop up and running. Easy-peasy so far.
At least that's my first impression. I haven't got my shop up and running yet, but I have a good feeling this is going to be easy, as the main thing missing on my side is adding a theme to my shop and publishing my products. 
So, what's left? Marketing of course, but heck, they can't do everything for me, right?
Oh, yeah one more thing to add. The product catalog seems to be growing every day. I found them on YouTube and they have some interesting product reviews. I hope they add more baby and maternity clothing soon. They've got a good selection of onesies, dresses, bags and stuff that fits my shop's niche pretty well, so I'm pretty excited to get those designs done asap."
"Awesome!!!!!! Great app for product reviews, time to get it if don't have it. easy to use interface."
easy peezy lemon squeezy. thanks. Good prices and easy interface. hope quality is good too!
503 Error all time! What happen with the interface?
Super simple user experience. I was set up within about 20 minutes and I was thinking about doing it for months
So far so good. Good interface and generally easy to use.
"this is a great app for free , it has an easy to use interface and is fast . it can be a glitchy sometimes but over all a very good app better than the other apps for importing reviews that i have tried."
"Love it so far! Clear artwork dimensions, easy and comfortable interface, access to a variety of printers (so you have a choice of prices, quality levels, and colors). After wasting hours trying to get other POD apps to work, I'm SO glad I found this one!"
Great application- easy to use and navigate interface. My customers seem to like it too.
"The app itself is great - lots of products, easy interface, and intuitive dashboard.  So far I haven't had any issues with products, but since Printify is technically a middleman for other printing vendors it is only a matter of time, statistically, with so many moving parts.  
My main beef with Printify is the cost of shipping which is ASTRONOMICAL.  Seriously.  And super confusing to try and keep up with, when it comes to offering multiple products that might be from a variety of vendors.  I had a customer place an order recently for 4 items - 2 t-shirts, a sweatshirt, and a small zippered pouch.  The 3 apparel items came from the same vendor and the pouch came from a second vendor, for a whopping total shipping cost of $17.50 (which comes to over $4 per item to ship).  
That is definitely excessive and enough to cause me to consider scaling back on the products I offer through Printify.  The name of the game is profit, and no customer is going to pay almost $20 in shipping for a couple shirts.  I wouldn't expect them to."
"The technical portion of the app is great and the developer should be very proud of the interface.  Well done!  
My issues is with customer service and quality control.  Printify is a middleman between printers and merchants.  While having a proxy to multiple printers can have its advantages, the downfall is with quality control and delays when there is an issue.
I have had a quality failure rate around 20% with the prints thus far.  One customer received a blank shirt with no print.  How embarrassing is that?  Then not having a direct line to the printer to correct the issue and expedite a resolution compounded the issue.  A customer in this situation is angry and does not want to wait days for two levels of bureaucracy to approve a reprint.  Then wait an additional 4 days for the print, and an additional 4-5 days for shipping.
Finally, the shipping charges are completely out of alignment with industry norms.  $4 for shipping the first product when the vendor is paying no more than $2.60 for a single shirt.  Then tacking on $2 for each additional shirt.  This is highway robbery.  If one orders 5 shirts, the shipping charge is $12.  The vendor isn't spending half of that.
The technology is great, but the application of the technology is pretty darn poor.  You can't build a brand on top of Printify.  If you are serious about being in this industry, find a printer that you can rely on who is just as maniacal about customer service as you are."
"So far so good, since installation a day ago, 3 customers have already signed up. In the previous month we only had two sign up for membership, so it has definitely improved customer retention. Installation was simple and the interface on our web page is unobtrusive but still prominent."
"Simple and easy interface. Many configurations and customization to choose from
App is sleek and effective."
This app looks promising..easy interface..good resource of tutorials to help setup the program and run. Would recommend it!
"I always send goodies with my orders but now I'm able to incentivize sales in the initial stage with this app that offers a easy user friendly interface for me and the customer. Thanks Sweet Tooth!
Badgermilk rules!"
"Kudos to Lynn, she's absolutely fantastic to work with. Love the interface! Works like a charm, and highly recommend this!"
"Top Notch. Easy to use, good user interface. I like how the customer can include images of the product"
So far so good. Support has been very responsive and has assisted us with every single issue we have had so far. The app itself is amazing and contains many different apps which we have slowly started to integrate into our store. User-friendly interface helps to make using apps easy.
I tried another app on Shopify and in my humble opinion it is not as user friendly.  I am not at all knowledgeable re graphics and pixels and the like but your interface is very easy to use.
"Great choice of items, great pricing, easy to use interface, and I received a call from an actual person after completing my first order! I highly recommend this app."
"This app is nailing it on every level.  Installation was simple and straight forward.  What tweaking I needed, that wasn't available in the large options of settings already, was promptly attended to by the Growave support staff. 
As a small business owner selling rather niche home decor products, I was hesitant to spend this kind of money on an App.  It is my opinion, a lot of apps are just too overpriced for the small business owner.  I understand that developers deserved to get paid for their work, but some pricing structures are just impossible to meet for a small owner to handle.
After giving this app a trial for about 2 weeks now, I can honestly say I believe it will be worth the money.  While I've only had a few people leave reviews under the Growave app, more and more are using my new Loyalty Program and Wishlist.  The interface is extremely professional looking, and works great from computer, iPad Shopify and Android Phone Shopify apps.  The various apps within this app are each individually customizable, with very detailed settings available within each app.  That said, all very easy to use.
I can't stress enough how responsive and supportive the support staff has been. Tursunai has been great.  Any tweaks I've needed to my theme to accommodate the app they have made while I was sleeping - since their on the other side of planet from me. :)  They've been very patient with my requests but very responsive, supportive, and accommodating!
I do wish some of the settings explanations were a bit easier to understand.  For example, in the Wishlist Reminder Email settings, one setting is ""We send this email only one-time within    to the same user.""  I don't understand the adjective ""same"" in this reference.  Same as what?  I do understand this is due to different cultures and possible language differences. :)
Second, and not that important, I wish the floating rewards tab was dismissable, yet accessible via a click of something or a menu - at least on mobile devices. Too many floating things can seem intrusive and distracting on smaller screens.  Along with that, would be nice to have ability to shorten rewards name for mobile screens. For example, ""Painted Heirloom Rewards"" for Computer and iPad, and just ""Rewards"" if viewed on Mobile.
That said, wish had option in settings to show or not show notifications pop-up on mobile vs. tablet vs. desktop computer.
Finally, I hope to see more options in general to changes settings of various apps behaviors, colors for everything, etc.
But, bottom line is, this is a great app at a fair price.  Period.  I can't say I would stick with it if it ever increases in cost, as I currently don't use 2 of the 7 functions, and not sure I ever will (Comments and Questions), as I'm trying to keep it clean.  Also, I don't bring in a lot of money.  I'm hoping that's where this app will help - obviously.
I say if you're on the fence, give the trial a go for 30 days.  See how your customers respond and how Growave helps to support your setup, and make your decision from there.  
For me, this 7-in-1 app is pretty much what I've been looking for, and the support staff, especially Tursunai, has been absolutely wonderful and top-notch!  I can't say enough good things about the support from Growave!
Vonda @ The Painted Heirloom"
"Like the products, and love the interface!"
"Printify is really the one-stop shop for print products.  I've mainly stuck to T-shirts so far but am now contemplating expanding to some of their other products, for example, home decor and wall art.
Good selection of T-shirts, including no-sweatshop options and v high quality. The interface for mocking up the designs is fairly easy to understand and all the technical details are spelled out re correct resolution, and proofing colors. 
What's really brilliant is they fulfill everything.  Once you've got your designs uploaded, just let the seamless integration with Shopify take over - in theory, there's nothing more to do.  
I recommend without hesitation."
"I had used this tool a while ago and I wasn't satisfied back then. However, since then they have rebuilt the whole interface and now it is very well organized, also the product catalog is full of great quality products at low prices, you can also choose your preferred manufacturer based on location factors for example. The whole process of creating a product is the best in the industry and it seamlessly integrates with my store too. 
This is not a paid review, I am fully grateful to have resorted to using this app. I haven't launched my store yet though, I will give another review (if possible) with the experiences then. Thanks!!"
"Great user interface and fantastic service. Lost a package in transit to a customer and they were prompt at helping me find it, as well as assisting me with a variety of other questions I had. Would definitely recommend."
"Love it. Have not really start using, but the easy to use interface amaze me. Hope the price can be lower though"
"Upon initial install, this product seemed to live up to the semi-canned ""great"" reviews. The interface looked amazing on my huge monitors, everything seemed to function well, there was a decent amount of product and options, and the prices were competitive.  But then there were problems that I noticed...  When I went to use the interface on my laptop-- smaller monitor-- the interface seemed to not scale properly. Also, several items had a default variant that would show up for no reason and you had to manually remove it from the Shopify side of things. I brought this up to their ""support"" via email with no response. Not even a form response saying they got my email.  Then, after I met their minimum posts to be able to get ""discounted"" proofs, I ordered a shirt.  It was TERRIBLE!  I had followed their CMYK to sRGB in PNG format and utilized their color samples (which are buried on their site) but it still looked like crap.  The edges weren't crisp, it looked like spray paint over-spray, and there was miss-registration issues.  It was a 2 color job, too, so not rocket science. A vinyl wall decal I ordered also had miss-registration issues, was not as described, and there's an odd black line running down one side-- probably a crop line.  I have switched back to my other vendor for all products except phone cases. I plan to not upload any additional creative for those until I can either be satisfied that this vendor will do those correctly or I settle on another vendor. I want to give it less stars, but will give the benefit of the doubt because I have not tried all of their products.  At the same time, though, I also would not recommend them."
Awesome the best reviews app there is. I really love the interface. just amazing. thanks a lot for a long trial period.
"So far so good, it has its slight flaws and errrors, but for the most part of it, pretty smooth. The customer service agents get back to you swiftly if you have any questions and take care of any of the problems you have. For screen printed garments on demand with U.K. Suppliers and with the interface and range of products.... yeah it's pretty good. If your a uk based business, definitely give it a go."
"Great app, helps a lot to get reviews, easy to use and have a good human-machine interface.  Enjoy using this app!"
"Great interface, provides mockups for you, and pretty good print quality when I got the products. Some things that other apps do that I wish this one did, but overall it's great!"
"I really love this app. Its simple to set up and the customer interface is really nice. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 as i feel like the price jump between a free account and one with some of the bells and whistles is a pretty big jump.
I would like to see that alittle more affordable, but apart from that it's great."
"I just installed this app, so far I like the setup and interface. 
Very straight forward and simple to use."
So far so good! Does everything as promised and even a novice store owner like me can understand it's intuitive interface and helpful suggestions. I'm looking forward to developing my business and I think this is just the app to help me do that.
So easy to use! Got up and running in no time. Intuitive interface and simple controls.
"We've just gotten started with our Sweet Tooth loyalty rewards program, and so far everything has been great! Integration couldn't have been simpler, and both the dashboard interface and customer facing popup are straightforward and easy to understand.
Sweet Tooth understands Shopify and integrates at a deep level, which we really appreciate. Best of all, there are even more great features in the pipeline for this app. Ben and Shane have been super helpful getting us up and running and answering our questions and concerns, and we're excited to see how the app performs for us over time. We could not recommend Sweet Tooth more highly!"
"second update: whatever was going on seems to have been fixed. working great again. Received email from developers after posting review. Who knows! I am sticking with them for now. 
update: the product generator is SO buggy. I've wasted countless hours trying to restore products that changed or disappeared entirely. The collections setting is terrible- I am forever resetting how products sort within shopify. Printify overrides EVERYTHING. 
One of my samples never arrived, fwiw, although that might be the post office's fault.
 I've found another app that offers all the same products as printify and a few others- seriously considering switching. 
original review:
Easy to use thus far. I have been approached by other print on demand services before and none had American made products. This one does, and it's interface is way more straightforward, so I chose this one. Fingers crossed I like the samples!"
The setup has been great and i love the interface. Lets see how things go :) I'm hoping this app will help build customer trust and generate more sales!
"The app does what it says. The interface is beautiful and easy to use. And in case you face any problems, the customer support is amazing! They're always willing to help. Regardless of what plan you're on!"
"Simple to setup, very clean interface and very useful for rewarding your most active participants!"
Simple and nice app. Easy to set up as well. Could have done better with interface.
Some of the best customer support that I have ever dealt with! :)) Super easy to use interface and looks great too.
"For us, one of the reasons to recommend this fantastic app is that it is under ACTIVE, PROMISING development. Almost every month you can see there's something new in this app, and the whole interface is gradually improving.
If you're considering using apps / plugins in your Shopify site, it is important to make sure you can get high-quality support from the developers. In our experience, we get the responses from Socialshopwave very quickly, and problems usually get fixed within days, even hours. Their customer service is really gorgeous, and can't be better.
Without their timely support, it's nearly impossible for us to make futher customizations. We really appreciate and think of it as a pleasure to see the developers keep making this feature-rich app more and more robust :)"
"Super easy to set up, good interface!"
I expected a better informative process of their production. They vary information to benefit the process in which they work. No interface to clearly state information to clients who are waiting 2 or more weeks on fulfillment. Needs to get a situation where they are able to inform clients of delays and also consumer.
"THIS IS A MUST HAVE APP!! I was previously with Yotpo and decided to look into other more affordable and service friendly alternative and that’s when I found SocialShopWave. So far I'm very impressed with all the great features this app has to offer, not to mention their awesome customer service. Edgar and his team have been extremely helpful answering all my questions and assisting me every step of the way. Their interface is very user friendly and for a non techy like me, setting up was super easy. They truly understand the needs of small businesses  :)"
"Easy to use, fun and a good free app! I found it off a recommendation, and was happy to have found it! definitely upgrades my website and user experience."
I use this apps with shopify. It's a great easy to use apps that gives you more authority and trust from customers. Great interface and really effective. thank you!
Easy to use interface with valuable assets.
"Great plugin, . Good user experience, easy to install, easy to operate. Optimized website must be recommended, recommend everyone to install"
"Fantastic app. Smooth interface, easy to use and easy to pick what reviews will show up on your store."
"Really great customer service, and easy-to-use interface. It was exactly what I was looking for with social login, and it seamlessly integrated with my site's branding.  Well done!"
"This application has a really good user interface, and is helpful for me when I’m mobile and need to check on orders."
"Really like Printful! I changed from Spreadshirt to Printful because of the better Customer Support, bigger range of products and way more friendly user interface."
"Fantastic interface, product syncing is excellent - and doesn't interrupt my additions to the product in Shopify - images etc!"
"It's super integrated with Shopify, it's amazing. Printful's user interface is also super well done. Can't recommend them enough."
Clean and easy interface. Smooth setup. Excited to see how this app performs.
Great app! Very simple to use user interface and setup procedure.  Up and running in no time! Thanks!
"Quick and Easy interface , great options even in the free version. Thanks"
It has a great interface and looks amazing
"Excellent support! Easy to use and beautiful interface. We used it on multiple sites we have, and all worked just fine!"
"we like, very practical.The integration of the interface with the garment is very good. On the other hand international shipments are delayed."
"Great app for accomplishing what its supposed to do! Legitimate reviews, easy to navigate admin interface, and definitely worth the cost!"
"Very nice app for reviews! Good interface, easy to use and not too cheap but also not too expensive. I recommend it"
"The best integration I've ever seen. Recommend for everybody. Intuitive interface, easy to install. Excellent."
"GREAT APP FOR SHOPIFY, BEST USER EXPERIENCE!"
"Trés bonne application !                                                                                      
Interface propre"
Easy installation and quite simple to use. Am liking it so far. Interface is not complicated - great for newbies like me.
"EDIT 03/22/2016 - 30 days being used.  This app takes time to see the return on investment, but I'm determined this is going to drive conversion and build loyalty with our customers.  We had a unique scenario and reached out to support and they responded within 24 hours.  Really makes life easier having great customer service.  Will update again!
ORIGINAL REVIEW - Smooth User Interface. Easy to use. Clear directions. Quick Support Communication. I mean what more could you possibly ask for? I looked at different options for loyalty rewards apps and settled on this one. I feel fortunate that I did because it's been great so far!"
"Perfect! Absolutely love this app, very easy interface and it gets you results, 100% recommend."
"Does exactly as advertised. Customizable yet simple interface. A simple, yet necessary app for any ecommerce business"
great easy way to track rewards for customers. :) Very easy interface!
"Ever order takes 30+ days to arrive (if it ever does)
Web interface is poorly designed with nothing but white background washing out all the functions on screen to make ordering easy but since you have to constantly search around for functions its just too tedious to work with.  They use DHL e- commerce shipping which is the WORST company to to logistics and freight with. Tracking information is too vague and items were lost. I will not be recommending Printful as they have proved to me how mickey-mouse this Print-on-demand company actually is.find someone local, get your stuff made and stock it yourself."
"This app has become an instant favorite.  I use it daily to add products.  They have one of the best selections I have seen on here and have a very friendly user interface, that is easy to navigate your way through."
"Doesn't do what it is supposed to do, totally waste of money, I don't know how much you pay Oberlo, but it is not working, It doesn't even sync with Shopify Reviews, and customer support is nonexistence. The Q&As are outdated, don't help at all. Sorry, I won't pay you the money for me to work it out myself with your awkward interface. 
For others, don't bother to try this, go for better apps, like Loox."
"Its a fantastic app and easy to use interface to organize products, orders and inventory. Definitely a must have for any store wanting to personalize their own products! 5 stars!"
Printful is a great for creating clothing product designs. the mock ups are beautiful and the interface is so easy to use. I am gradually getting sales too on our store ijese.com.ng and fulfilment is good but I hope shipping can be even faster. kudos guys!
"I love the selection of hats to print your designs to!
Easy user interface!
I would recommend this to any apparel shop owner!"
Perfect app! with easy to use interface.
"Great user experience! Shopify integration is seamless, very happy with the service, constantly improving. Well done!"
Just a great User interface. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone. The syncing is well integrated as well.
Smooth interface. Nice options. Will keep using this product.
I use this app to complete all of my prints for my brand. Awesome! My favorite feature is being able to create designs right on the interface. Merchants should grab this app because its super easy to use & the material is amazing!
"I use this app to get my t-shirts to my customers fast, easy and cost-efficient. I like that it's so simple to set-up and that Printful guided me every step of the way. I think Printful needs to improve on its variety. There's not enough to choose from, not enough pants. Also, it won't hurt to have more melanated mockup models. Also, It is not a good idea to have the mockup of the woman holding the black frame to be wearing all-black. The site interface needs work. When I select only a single frame size, in my store, it no longer displays a size. This can be fixed by adding the size to the mock view. I would like to be able to put the frames measured in cm to inch with an auto calculator. When placing my designs on some mock-ups it is impossible to center. I would like to know where my design is positioned by number. Why is it when I click Back to Browser it hopes me somewhere random and not to the previous page?"
App is easy to use and my customers love the interface of the program
"Excellent customer service. Friendly, knowledgeable, and fast to respond. The app interface looks great. Slick UX."
"Great App, Interface is very user-friendly"
"I chose Loox because of the visual reviews and although I haven't had anyone post pictures yet, I know that a certain percentage will do so. The interface is excellent and easy to use. I especially love being able to post the reviews to both my Facebook Biz page and my Pinterest boards where I created one for just ""Customer Review"".  
The tech support at Loox is speedy, professional and extremely helpful. I am very pleased that I switched to Loox."
"Great interface, a tad bit price heavy but great vendors and shipping doesnt cost an arm and a leg."
"Printful has enabled us to launch our business which has been performing extremely well since our first day in October of 2018. Though their prices are a few dollars higher than their competitors, you can trust their quality and customer service since it's direct, in-house fulfillment within their own facilities which obviously all hold themselves to the same (high) standards. Anytime we've shopped around for better rates, we return to Printful because of their user interface & level of quality and reliability. Their facility in Latvia turns around orders so quickly that business in booming in Europe. We cannot recommend Printful enough!"
"This app is A M A Z I N G! Works great and a really fantastic user experience, plus dashboard and interface. You will not be disappointed. Customer service is fast and super helpful. Highly recommended!"
We are so pleased with how easy and user friendly the interface is from the start. We needed support to integrate with our store and they were really responsive and friendly and solved the issues we had.  You won't be disappointed in choosing Gift Wizard!
"Near perfect. Swapping the default display .jpg for .png is nearly impossible after making a product, but I expect the interface to only improve with time."
Does what it says.  They are adding new features all the time.  Great support and easy to use interface.
"Good interface, integration and turn around. EU shipping is great - Ideally a UK based centre would be a full 5*"
"I love this app !!! This provider has very good quality, all of their clothes are beautiful and good! The graphics interface it's easy and!"
Just installed the app and found Ari really helpful. The interface is very user friendly and the Youtube tutorial is easy to follow. Still in the trial period but already sold a voucher so delighted! Great way to build your business with moving to the more expensive Shopify Plan. Lots to explore and discover. Thanks Ari.
"We love the interface and all the options! Very useful and easy to use. The more we dug into the app the more impressed we were. 
100% worth installing."
A really useful app - has allowed us to spot issues and fixes for better user experience quickly. Would recommend.
"This app makes creating a store easy for the newbie entrepreneur.  My favorite part is the new lifestyle mockups.  It, also, interfaces with great ease with Shopify.  I really like having the ability to add products to my store through the app rather than Shopify.  Much easier!"
"My name is Justin and I'm a theme developer. 
I've spent a lot of time on researching for the right gift card solution. I think GiftWizard is by far the best one on the app store. 
I should probably start with the fact that the user interface of the dashboard is not good enough and they need to improve this part (Mark from their team said it is going to happen soon). 
Having said that, it's not just REALLY good for sales, but also for marketing - their tools allow you to send gift cards to customers and help you to bring them back to the store. It helped my clients to ramp up their gift card program."
Really great app! Its simple to use for the most part and give you the data that you really need in a clear interface - Truly 5 Stars!
Service is just WONDERFUL. So far I'm very happy with the interface and service. Highly recommended.
Amazing great user experience easy to use !
"They have been helpful and responsive as much as anyone can reasonably expect from a service that is free to use, their interface and technology is so far ahead of the other POD services so this is a huge bonus knowing that you can trust the tech behind it and it's very straight forward and easy to figure out."
"Easy to use, easy to implement, and it's free. It's no risk to use and I love the simple interface."
I have been using autoresponders for 12 years. This one blows them all out of the water! Easy user interface. Intuitive flows and tons of data to analyze to understand your customers. I highly recommend it!
User friendly interface! Invaluable app for successful selling campaign! Must-have app in each store!
"Can't say enough great things about Ari at Gift Wizard along with all the other folks behind the scenes!
In a period of 24 hours they worked on fine tuning our site to work exactly the way we wanted it to. Their response time is within minutes of reaching out to them. We had some ""special"" circumstances with integrating our gift wrapping products with their Gift Wizard app and they came to the rescue, writing additional code to accommodate a user friendly interface for our customers.
This is a great product out of the box but the real testament is the personal attention we received from their support staff.
Big Thanks from all of here at Puppy Culture!"
"I wouldn't recommend this app.
I installed it ~3 days ago and upgraded it, thinking it would be a good idea, BUT the interface sucks! 
I was getting stressed and spending a lot of time on it, trying to fix the default reviews and etc.
So I just decided to cancel it! 
I thought there was a 7-day trial after upgrading it but it seems like after upgrading it you're done. I still have to pay the $9 charge by the end of my billing cycle even though I only used this app for 3 days!
Such a waste of money."
"This app is amaze balls for on demand printing.  I love the interface, it's insanely easy to add a variety of products in short order."
Had an issue after the easy install because I realized that for our customer base the app interface would need a little tweaking. Needed to buy the pro version for the customizations I would require. Support was pretty quick and very thorough.
"I've used Printful for 4 years and while their Shopify integration and online interface is top notch, easy to use and far superior to their competitors, their products and service are a mixed bag. You definitely have to test individual items and stay on top of every order. Some things, like their unframed prints, are great. Other things, like their shirts, are not a quality I could comfortably charge anyone money for. Still others, like hats, are sometimes great, and sometimes bad. Their biggest struggles seem to be customer service and shipping, which have gone drastically downhill in the last year. Customer service, if for anything more than a replacement for a faulty order, often seems to have language issues in understanding details and situations, leading to days of back and forth before getting resolved or given up. Packages often take longer to deliver and seem to disappear for a day or two in the midst of tracking their progress, especially since they have switched to DHL. Orders from California are almost always good, those from North Carolina often seem to have more problems. When an order arrives faulty, they do make it up quickly with a replacement or refund. That said, these are the big guys with tons of customers. They've been around longer than their competitors and aren't going anywhere, but it feels like they keep growing and somehow never get over their growing pains. They aren't awful; they're worth using, but be sure to test each product first, and don't rely on them as your only product source."
"Perhaps a little early to give a full review as this is a recent installation. However, Klaviyo is already hitting a lot of the right boxes. After trying out several marketing automation systems, I finally found one that allied ease of use, slik design, friendly interface, relevant help tips, and features. To be continued..."
"I love this app if i could give it 6 stars I would. Easy to use and amazing interface, I'd definitely recommend it to any and everyone"
"The best email service I've ever used, no other service comes near. Best interface, best integration, best templates, everythig is so easy to use and to find. Simply, the best."
"Printful has taken something that's a complex problem, and built an intuitive platform to solve it. The more time I spend in Printful building my store, the more I appreciate how they thought through the user experience design. There's quite a bit of work that goes into building your online store, and Printful makes it about as painless as possible.
We started with Squarespace but then moved over to Shopify. So far, the integration between Shopify and Printful has proved to be far superior. 
There's many things to love about Printful, but here's a few that come to mind:
- the tees and hats I received are as good as I hoped for (maybe better). The tee blank and the digital print are the highest quality you're going to find anywhere.
- Creating products inside Printful is the way to go. It's easier to create the product and have it push to the store, instead of creating the product in the store and have it push to Printful. Now I can upload one design and create about 10 different items from one art file.
- The live support has been the thing that helped me get going. There have been a half dozen small questions I had while getting up and going. The immediate chat support is what makes this a 5-star experience.
Now I've got 3 other businesses that have asked me to set up a Shopify/Printful store for their needs as well. 
And if that wasn't enough to love, there's also a Printful app you can download to track your store's activity."
Super easy and awesome interface
"Decent app.
PROS: 
It's free. Shopify should have a built-in review engine, anyway, but it's hard to argue with free.
Easy to use.
Easy to install.
Looks great—better, actually—on mobile.
CONS
Slow loading. This is not unique to this app—most Shopify apps, even the really good ones, take a few extra seconds to load. I just figure if it's Shopify native, it should load a little more quickly. We keep it at the bottom of the page so it doesn't hurt user experience too much.
MISSING FEATURES
Display Limits + Pagination for reviews. This is an obvious feature. We should be able to set how many reviews display at once, such that users can scroll or click to the next bunch of reviews.
""Verified Buyer"" badges. Most modern review engines have these. If Shopify is also the order processor, this should be the easiest thing in the world to implement.
Conditional tag displays. Another easy one—if the product has no reviews, why clutter up the Collection or Product page with empty stars and a ""no reviews yet"" notice?
Easy CSS overrides. There are already a few built into the engine (star color, border and padding, etc), but things like font sizes would be great to have at least some control over."
"Delivers as promised. Reviews seamlessly integrate with your theme.
Interface is easy and the bulk importing of reviews is fantastic as well. Seeing those 5 stars illustrating a Google search engine result always brightens up your day."
"I love the user-interface, product selections, ease-of-use, and customer service. I would recommend to a friend."
"Super easy to install and use. Importing contacts from mailchimp was a breeze and the interface is easy to understand and use, and I'm not an expert. Highly recommend."
"Very helpful app. High quality product and i want to collaborate with them more longer. 
But they should make the interface more and more easily for user."
Easy to use and user-friendly interface!
"Klaviyo is a beautiful email marketing solution for Shopify.  The user interface is simple, yet full of just the right features.  The data collection allows me to tag and segment my list seamlessly.  Finally, the education and support they provide for their platform is some of the best I've seen.  So glad I found it."
"I haven't been able to use this for long enough yet, but I like the interface and the concept. I am hoping more of a trial will give me a better idea of how this works."
"This is a must have app for your store.
Great interface."
"Great app, the the user interface is there any chance you can add a selector to change the number of reviews per page?"
"I must say we were pretty disappointed by the old version of the app, but since Shopify remade the app (Structured Data, embed interface, new features), we're really happy with it ! 
No ""social network"" share or other heavy features, but for those who wants a simple and efficient review app, this one is the one !"
"I like the simplicity of this app - both for the customer and the back-end interface. It only works for products though, and I would like to be able to embed the code into a Shop Reviews page because each of my products are unique and after being sold are removed (and therefore the reviews will also be removed). Also, it would be great if the social share options were available to customers who submit.
As for automatic emails with coupon codes, I prefer to manage that within Shopify and personally contact each of my customers, so I'm fine with the fact that the app doesn't offer this. Again, I like its' simplicity and ease of use, and particularly that the interface stays within the Shopify admin panel.
Nice app, I look forward to seeing the above updates if possible."
So far the customer service and User experience has far surpassed Mailchimp and I've only just begun! So excited for this App!!
"This is a great app and the experience has been tremendous. I am somewhat of a tech geek but it's been 10 years since I've been under the hood.  So current technology is beyond me. This app was easy to install, has straightforward instructions and when I got stuck, tech support was QUICK AND OUTSTANDING. After reading a lot of reviews and user experiences, we chose grapevine reviews for our shopify store and it was clearly the right product for us."
"This was the first email marketing app I have used for shopify. As a newbie to the whole email marketing game, I was quite surprised at how user friendly the app was and how seamlessly it was integrated to my store. Definitely recommend Klaviyo for the features that the app comes packed with and the amazing user experience. Wonderful job Klaviyo team."
I am enjoying the interface and customer support. I hope to get my live rates issue resolved soon and then 5 out of 5 for me.
"Amazing service, very easy interface and very easy to use"
"I've used this app and find it very good but with some exceptions. 
1) The interface is not easy to figure out. It needs to be simplified.
2) You can't delete any of the campaigns that you don't want. This creates a lot of clutter.
I like apps created for ease of use and where the operator has full control. This is not one of them. However, it is much better than MailChimp which I uninstalled because it was very frustrating. It would never update properly.
Although Klaviyo needs work, I still recommend it. Good support."
"Awesome App, Always Improving. I tried this app before, uninstalled it because of it's long import time. They improved this issue, made the interface better, and now I use it again (the full package). Keep on improving guys."
"I've had this app since yesterday after hearing about this platform through the E commerce uncensored podcast.  
So I haven't used this app for long, however I've found the experience so far smooth and straightforward. They employ a powerful and intelligent system that helps you to create effective emails, really boosting your email marketing potential. I would definitely recommend making use of there academy where you can view a bunch of tutorial videos that will help you in setting up your campaigns, flows, segments, lists etc. It's important you spend time understanding the system so that you can utilize it at the optimal level.    
In addition, another great part about using Klavyio as a beginner, like myself, is that it's free for up to 250 subscribers. If you're looking to really boost your sales and take your store to the next level, whatever that level is, Klavyio is definitely the best option, in my opinion.
Lastly, I love the interface, I find it really easy to navigate around Klavyio, which is always great, especially if you don't particularly enjoy this part of e commerce, setting up marketing. This site makes it easy for you to set up one of the most important and effective methods of making sales, email marketing!
I'll leave it there."
Good Interface and Easy to use. Worth The money
"i use this app for the first time, but i think the interface is great and easy to use and i love it."
I just sent my first campaign. Really easy and compared to similar apps really nice interface and newsletter builder. thumbs up! :)
It's a easy interface that really helps me with renderings to make sales.
I started to use this app currently.  It has useful interface.
"Very easy to set up account and start designing right away.  It was my first time starting an ecommerce store, but I had my store set up with products to sell within only a couple of hours thanks to Printful.
Printful provides much more in-depth information on shipping and other aspects of their service than other print-on-demand (POD) providers that interface with Shopify.  Printful also offers hats, which I have not found on any other reputable-seeming POD provider apps.
I've noticed that the shirt prices seem a bit higher than others, but I believe that it is well worth it given the ease of use and amount of informational material."
"Very good! Easy to use, smart interface"
Easy and simple to use. The interface is very clean and saving abandoned carts and sending emails will work wonders
"Free Shipping Bar by Hextom is not just merely a good and useful app to boost sales for our store. Their user experience is excellent, I've encountered several problems and their support team has assisted me with fast and swift responses to aid me to solve my problem."
"The interface is a big confusing blob of whatever.
I can't set up anything without it not working. Finding help is so hard, it is not funny.
It is also not funny losing money because I can't set up emails properly in this stupid interface."
"If you are serious about email marketing and you own an e-commerce website, do yourself a favour and ditch MailChimp... 
Go with Klaviyo!
Once again, this app is not perfect.
Klaviyo has been getting some bad rep with their customer service time of response (but have you ever tried to easily find a contact link in MailChimp?? Nowhere to be found!)
This is the kind of application that is worth studying.
It's not a ""one-click it works"" app.
Learn it... study it's potential.
Email marketing can become one of your main source of recurring income for your e-commerce.
Once your flows are running, you get a clear idea of which ones are profitable and which ones need improvement.
Their focus on e-commerce is why you need this app.
It's not cheap, but it grows with you.
So the more it will cost, the more money you will make.
Stop comparing the monthly cost with other basic email apps.
They don't compare.
Once setup this app will pay for itself 20X.
The level of segmentation you get with Klaviyo out of the box is where the power is found.
They keep coming up with new features too (dynamic coupons!! yeah!).
They keep improving the interface.
Learn how to use this powerful email app and you'll never look back."
Useful app with great interface. Easy to use.
"Amazing app! It works great, and user experience is awesome. Don't hesitate to sign up! Highly recommended!"
"Very handy app, and really helps us fill in the gaps at https://www.BIYHomebrewSupply.com by allowing automated emails and list building integrations with Shopify that other email list senders didn't really support very well.  Easy interface, templates could be better, and is priced fairly (but I think all email list sending services charge too much, given how few emails actually get opened with each campaign send... but that's not to Klaviyo's detriment--their product is pretty freaking sweet)"
"I've used several email apps and this is one of the best. Like most things it takes a little to get used to the interface, but its is easy to use and intuitive. The pre-built email flows are great!"
"Tight email automation, great interface. I'm ditching mail chimp next month"
"The app has a very annoying and downright bad behavior to import all the products it finds once connected to shopify, without the users' consent. This is web development 101. You should first ASK what to import (if at all) and then also provide the ability to REMOVE anything in case the user wants.
You don't do either of those. You import the entire collection, and then only offer an ""ignore"" option, instead of removal, which forces me to see a whole bunch of irrelevant products in the interface. BAD, BAD, BAD! This is enough reason for me to not use the app! You should fix it ASAP. I am lucky to be using the product feed still in test mode, with only a few dozen items, because I had almost 7000 products in the database. I can only imagine the mess your app would cause, not to mention the trouble I would have to go through to ""ignore"" the imported ones, after its done. This is seriously a BUG in your product design. I don't know who came up with this, but it is unacceptable. I will not use the app until this is fixed. You are doing everything right, and this stupid workflow design ruins your otherwise competitive advantage. I will change my review if I see any progress on the matter. Until then, I will have to tolerate the bozos at Teespring and run two store backends instead of one. So to recap, you have no right to import products, other than create a channel and tags for what you provide. Shopify store owners sell a bunch of stuff, which are completely irrelevant to your line of business. So STOP the automatic importing as not only it has nothing to do with your service, it is also a dumb practice not to mention intrusive. I don't want to share my datafeed with you or anyone else. Especially without my permission. And last but not least, the whole thing is BACKWARDS! Why would I want to EXPORT my shopify datafeed to printful, when its obvious utility is to do the exact OPPOSITE, which is to provide me  a way to design T-shirts, IMPORT them to my shopify store for display, and get the buyer data once a sale is made to do the delivery. That's it ! Its not rocket science! Fix the thing to do just that."
"Don't waste your time looking at other drop shipping companies/apps to use on Shopify, just create an account on Printful RIGHT NOW!  Very easy to use interface, EXTREMELY fast product turn around times, very straight forward design process and templates and high quality products. I use Gildan 64000 tee shirt and recently ordered a sample order (which they give 20% off on) and the shirts were high quality, not scratchy and didn't fall apart in the washer. Not to mention my designs were just as they should be, not crooked like some products I got from other companies. 
5/5 would recommend Printful."
"6 stars!
These guys do everything right. AND give a generous free version with all the features until you're positive ROI with 250 contacts. Amazing. Complex abilities, easy interface. I wish every app would be like that."
"PROS:
-Easy to setup
-All automatic
-Simple interface
-Great support
-Awesome quality products
CONS:
-Super expensive
-Long fulfillment time
-Small selection of products"
"I like Klaviyo, my favorite part about their program is the ability to easily replace the terrible default shopify email templates with nicely designed Klaviyo emails. For me it was Klaviyo vs ActiveCampaign, I loved AC's incredible marketing automation ability, but Klaviyo offers a lot of functionality in that department too and is much easier to use. Ultimately running a successful business is all about user experience and Klaviyo's wins in that category with it's nice email templates."
"Simple, easy to use. Great interface, clear instructions."
This App is very easy to use with friendly user interface
"I was at first a bit hesitant because the basic looking interface, but this has quickly become one of my favorites!"
the integration with shopify makes this an extremely versatile marketing tool. the user interface is very intuitive. worth every penny.
"Hands-down the best email marketing software we've ever used. Klaviyo not only makes the user experience simple enough for anyone in our company to use, but the analytics have allowed us to make decisions that increase our revenue immediately. If you haven't started using this yet, you are leaving money on the table."
Easy to use interface and great selection of shirts.  Plenty of how-to videos to walk through all aspects of setting up to have shirts printed.
The user interface is a cinch to use and I absolutely love their quality and service!
"Love this APP, does all the things I need in just one app instead of paying for multiple different apps. Better abandon cart tracking and easy user interface. Great Job!

The support we receive from Printful is unparalleled. Intuitive interface and responsive customer support!
Excellent app! Very smooth interface!
"Great interface, easy to upload images and create products.  The prints themselves are very high quality and I was honestly blown away when I received my first printed iPhone case.  The turn around time on your customer's items can be a little lengthy sometimes, but it is to be expected.
My only real complaint is that the packaging is not the greatest and my customers have told me their items arrive often times balled up and shoved haphazardly in a non-tear bag.  But in the end, the quality of the products makes up for this.
Thank you,

I love Printful. They have the best service and their user interface is the best I've ever used. Would totally recommend this service to everyone. I just wish the pricing was a little more inline with comparable services. Some items are just ridiculously over priced that it's hard to turn any kind of profit. So I have to stick with the lower quality items.
I was so afraid to use this and boy was I surprised. I was able to get in and do what I had to do quite easily. I love that the interface is user friendly..they have a fan in me!
"THEY ARE THE BEST, THEIR USER INTERFACE IS WELL DESIGNED WITH NO BUGS (I TRIED SOME OTHER DROPSHIPPING APPS AS WELL, THEY WERE SUCH A HEADACHE) + GOOD QUALITY AND COSTUMER SERVICE + GOOD SHIPPING RATES. I JUST HOPE THEY ADD A FEW MORE PRODUCTS"
"This app has a great user interface on the site, and decently intuitive controls on the dashboard. I was having some trouble with adjusting the colors of the widgets to match my brand and they were able to help me with a fast turn around! It really helps make your site look professional and allows customers to easily utilize tags and other criteria to filter their results."
"Above all else, the responsive and expansive support from the Searchanise team is enough for me to recommend this app.
Furthermore, the ease of use, intuitive functionality, Custom CSS fields for further customization, and out-of-the-box clean interface make this an exceptional service. Not to mention it's a bargain of a price!
If you've had poor experiences with search tools or companies in the past, switch to this. You won't regret it."
"it work very well, and offer many possibilities; user interface is very easy"
"Its ok, not bad to use, but a bit complicated interface"
"Easy to use. Interface allows you to edit from within Shopify and Printful and import with ease. Support is A+++ left a message (after hours) they called back within 6 hours - rep was helpful, resourceful and pleasant. My problem was solved in minutes and everything else is gravy!!! Highly recommend."
"Just added it and was asked after I created the bar (damn) but the interface seems simple to create and it's on my site SO far, so Good..."
"Product easily pays for itself with an enhanced user experience on the site. Also, the customer support is amazing."
"Great app and great support team ! For our niche store with multiple products, the search is important and with this app the user experience is really good, both on desktop and mobile."
"PRO:
This app is the cleanliest, sleekest, trust icon badge for products on the shopify store. 
Very refreshing, easy-to-use user interface that you could tell time was put into creating.  
Con
- Should add bitcoin badge. This is still a 5/5 app, badge is not a huge deal."
"Simple set and forget it interface.  I reached out to support to assist in adding padding around the widget and received a prompt answer that solved my problem.  I just wish the badges were in color.  Otherwise, perfection!"
Have been using the Printful App for a week.  Nice interface and fairly intuitive.  Would recommend.  Take a look at some of the products I set up with it at FavoriteObsession.com
This search app is very feature rich and provides fast search results that gives a positive user experience. Highly recommended!!
"Great interface, great service, taken my business to the next level."
Wonderful additions to native search via a plug n' play interface. Exactly what I'd hope for out of a plugin.
Best interface for a product creator I've used yet.
"easy to use, responsive, good user experience, quick to install. overall great experience"
PushOwl web notification is one of the best notification App. App's user interface is very cool and support team is very supportive. My experience is very good with Pushowl. Thank You PushOwl.
Great Support ! And they keep the app up to date and improving with the user interface and new features !
"Searchanise is a great app. When we installed the app it provided a much better user experience for customers than Shopify search. We have been using this app for over a year and we love it.
Also, they have an AWESOME support team that will answer any questions you may have."
"Good app for push notifications on web - very easy to use and intuitive interface. We have monthly calls with a member from the PushOwl team, which has been helpful in allowing us to further optimise our strategy and gain the most out of PushOwl features. The team is also receptive to feature requests & improvement suggestions. Would be nice to see the app further develop integrations with CRM tools like Klaviyo, etc"
"We tried a few other search tools first but this is by far the best.  Even more so, everything we asked to be solved was done properly and fast by the developers - couldn't ask for more.  The functionality is also excellent and really improves user experience"
"App is working as expected , Easy to use, Nice Interface, Clear Instructions , Good Support, recommended to all"
"One of the apps that never created any kind of problems. Easy to use interface, helpful for automation and a great support team."
"Nice functionality and easy to use interface with lots of options. Also, they are adding more every time I check in. We have seen a difference in our sales. Would like to see an option to automatically send a follow-up email a week after purchase for product reviews."
Great app. Makes everything extremely easy to set up even including new phone case editions (after figuring out to make new variations and then configure them in existing products via the app interface). Support extremely helpful and nice - overall a great app to start up a store. Thanks from the Maxisocks team.
"WOW, so I saw PushOwl all over, integrations for almost every application I could find, etc, right away when I started I received hep from Felix was immediately on a Zoom with me and Ramees was EXCEEDINGLY also helpful. Great support is integral to a great shopify application and right away I can assure you that this indeed is one. It integrates with almost every application that I care to use and that provides me with great value across the board! Usually it takes a while for applications to really get a good hold on clients, and leading to the best of conversions, not only that, the conversion increase, while not reducing bounce rate, because the best ways to reduce bounce rate often include speed optimization or just visual UI , ( user interface ), after being on Shopify for 6-7 years and seeing Push Owl for soo soo long, not knowing what application to use and try Push as I had lost hope in it a while ago. I decided to consolidate applications and add push owl, it's basically at almost no cost forever unless you want to add some features, which I HIGHLY recommend ( however trust me the trial lasts long enough to pay for this! I have worked on the app for maybe 5 minutes, no joke. I jumped onto the application, immediately received simplified, very to the point ( I mean even without it, they have a very simple to understand user interface so that you have just as amazing of an experience as your client. ) I'm so happy to have installed this application! It's really been my favorite of the 3-4 new ones ( I have 60+ and leave reviews here and there throughout my stores, but just on this one over the years I've accumulated even more... yea.. anyways so onwards... I know for a fact I've made $100 in abandoned carts recovery without setting any campaigns like email for shopify through other of the top 10 applications I would recommend for shopify users. This was in 2 days with 3-5 minutes has generated $100! Literally just got back into working on this Shopify Store, and I use mainly shopify as it is the best online e-commerce platform. To any new users looking to raise their conversion rate, your theme can be free shopify offers many free ones, or you could be using a $8,000 theme and still be gaining value that is intangible anywhere else online through any application, I'll be recommending it to my clients and definitely recommend it to any new users looking to get the most out of shopify! I know that my shopify store has not only gained an amazing application ( 4 subscribers ... $100.... 3-5minutes of having the work done for me mainly... they help a LOT.. there's a reason there are 0 1,2 & 3 star reviews and basically 0 4 stars, everyone see's the value. I've seen this app for so long, heard of it, Push owl was all over, and guess what? Simply not realizing that Push Owl was so great and that the power of using Push Notifications for E-Commerce is almost a better practice than SMS , Email, Messenger Applications, thus far I can say that this will be one of the best ways to improve my Shopify conversion rate, and is in my top 5, and top 10 applications I own. THANK YOU SO MUCH TO THE PUSH OWL TEAM! I sincerely am forever grateful! Anyone looking to add a few apps and doesn't know where to start, add push owl, and thank me later hahaha, SERIOUSLY!... Anyways.. I highly suggest you give this application a try. You have a free trial and I believe even plan.. so you really have nothing to lose if you keep it inactive. But trust me... you won't ... this is years of experience, I've used Shopify for years since it was just a baby hahaha, and Push Owl, has made me a believer for Push Notifications being a great converter. I can not wait to further optimize this application to raise conversion rates for my shopify store! THANK YOU TO THE PUSH OWL TEAM! AMAZING APPLICATION!"
"Very useful app and great support. We saw a good amount of additional potential customers with PushOwl. Simple, intuitive interface and fast support. They get back with answers very fast."
So far it's worked great! Excellent interface and everything seems to be managed very professionally.
"We have been using Pushowl only for a short time, but seeing a lot of conversions. The interface is sleek and sending out campaigns is easy, recommended. Drives sales and is easy to use. Fast response from customer service."
"The simplicity of this app is fantastic.  Printul is providing excellent UX by automating repetitive tasks, and providing an intuitive interface that speeds the process greatly."
"Honestly the best support I have ever experienced. Product is slick, staff are super helpful.
Installed without any issue, intuitive interface. Highly recommended."
The interface is seamless. Handling a very important and powerful aspect of the eCommerce. We're sticking to pushowl for now!!
"Very useful app and fantastic support. We saw a good amount of additional potential customers with PushOwl. Simple, intuitive interface and fast support. They get back with answers very fast."
"Comfortable interface, and a wonderful service!"
"User-friendly interface, great support, great features. Highly recommended."
"Simple, Quick and Effective.
Just installed and it's done. The app's interface is also pretty intuitive as well.
Great choice. Would recommend.
Thanks guys!"
Push Owl's simple interface makes it enjoyable to use. Plus it's growing integrations are a plus. Staff is top notch and what the service provides is essential for every ecommerce.
Love this app!  Best app for a good user experience when searching the website.  Thank you for the help.
"Straightforward interface that's simple but also has all the necessary tools and metrics to run effective push. Customer support is also excellent, no complaints!"
"Aside from the incredibly unique and user-friendly interface (Shopify as well as their web page), I truly enjoy the customer service and amount of products and services that are provided with Printful. I spoke with Alex for well over an hour and he not only addressed every question or concern I had but he happily informed me of additional resources and services they provide that were close to if not exactly what I was asking. This company is definitely hard to beat; it has now become the new one-stop-shop for my small business and I look forward to a very successful business relationship with Printful. Thank you again Alex for the outstanding experience and informative high-energy attitude to make the best decisions for my business. I highly recommend this company, If I could exceed the five-star rating I gladly would have!"
"Great app, esay, fast and good admin interface!"
"Having only just uploaded the search app, I can't comment as to whether conversion has increased. But from the word go I have been more than impressed with this app. It only took a few minutes to install and set up (unlike other search tools we have used, which clashed with our site). Having tested the app, I can confidently say that it works perfectly and enhances user experience. Thanks"
"This is a seemless integration with Shopify.  At this point we have ZERO issues or complaints, and we are extremely happy with the user interface."
"What an awesome app! It is so easy to use, and the interface is extremely helpful. It is working well for 
reversemovement.com"
"I've been using Prihtful for my e-commerce site, Rainbow Social - http://www.rainbowsoc.com - for about a month.  I'm still getting the hang of it, but so far so good.  I'd like the mockups to be of higher resolution, but the interface, ease of use is awesome!"
This app is amazing! The customer service is excellent and the end product is of high quality! I'm using the app for my store MinteeFashion.com - The user interface is very straight forward and the company actually wants you to succeed. I would recommend it to anyone! :)
Easy to use. east to handle interface.
awesome easy to use simple interface
PushOwl has been a huge help in allowing our company to further expand and engage with our customers. I appreciate how the PushOwl team takes into consideration update requests to further improve its platform for better user experience. I also appreciate how the team is willing to provide pointers regarding best practices used with web notifications to ensure their customers get the most from their experience. It's an all-around great platform.
Very nice interface and helpful staff. Looking forward to working with PushOwl on my Squishysaurus store.
"Push owl has a really easy to use interface and the support is fantastic.  If you're looking to push deals without or in addition to emails, this is the app to do it."
"This app is just the better way to grow sales and the customer service is always near to help us for any inquiries,I  found it very helpful and the admin interface is very easy to use  I love it"
"PushOwl has a very easy to use interface for campaigns, automations and more. Plus, customer service is always prompt, friendly, and thorough. Not only do they answer questions, they provide helpful suggestions to improve your experiences."
"Rameez actively chatted me up and informed me about a change in the browsers which would not show the popups to customers who don't engage with most of these notifications, and let me know about how to change it to a custom popup. Using the custom popup will actually also increase conversion rates of visitors (since they will know what they need). Didn't know about this feature - good work PushOwl team. Am also happy with the interface, clean and easy to use."
One of the most intuitive user interfaces I have ever seen - very easy to set up and get going.
So far so good. Loving the interface!! Crazy simple to use.
Installed....great for customer user experience!
"UPDATE 2: Still have my gripe below but quality has been good every time and turn-around is quick.  Quality and turn-around time have been better than their competitors and their app is by far the most well designed. 
UPDATE: I've received several samples from Printful. Quality has been great and the fulfillment process is seamless. But here is my gripe and the thing that gives me pause on moving forward with the Printful app. They've just done a product revision and the way they've handled it shows a lack of concern for the time and money invested by their users.  
In this revision, they majorly changed the sizing and fit of one of their products invalidating all files that were made according to the guidelines they set previously.  Apparently the old Printful templates that I used to design my products will no longer be acceptable for their print, cut, sew process. It would take at least a weeks worth of work to revise all of my designs to fit the new templates.  This unfortunately is not an option for me so I will not be able to continue to offer these products that I've invested several months in designing and promoting. 
While I do appreciate Printful's attempt to improve their product this latest update doesn't seem to take into consideration the time invested by their users. Printful could have built upon the old template to incorporate the new sizes.  Instead they scrapped the old template, making it along with all the work that went into following it's guidelines totally obsolete.  Needless to say, Printful's latest update doesn't do a lot for my confidence in moving forward with them.  It seems to show their lack of concern for the time invested by their users.  
It also shows their lack of concern for the money invested by their users.  The samples I've purchased from Printful (before they announced they were totally revising the product) are now useless.  I bought these samples so that I could best advise my customers on the shape, fit and sizing of Printful's product. Now that Printful has changed all of these aspects plus invalidated my design file, what's the point in having these samples? Will Printful reimburse me for these since they are no longer samples from which I can advise my customers?
ORIGINAL REVIEW: I like the app interface a lot.  Hope it will keep improving with more mock-up generators etc. But it's a wonderful option for print on demand.  Have not received any sample product yet but I assume it's of the same quality as Society6."
Brilliant app. Has completely upgraded our user experience. Love the way it picks up typos and suggests what the user is looking for. Very accurate. Thanks guys.
Great user experience and great customer service
We use PushOwl app for reaching out to more of our customers via push notifications. This app is very easy to use and has user friendly interface. PushOwl support team is quick to respond and very helpful with any of our requests.
"Works great. easy setup. Invaluable for my boutique men's clothing site www.uptownmale.com. With out it i feel it would cheapen the user experience and would lead to lost sales. I know when i'm shopping for clothing if my shopping cart gets wiped out i stop shopping on that site.
Thanks from,
www.uptownmale.com"
"This app has been a godsend, the actual springboard to me finally launching my apparel & merch company--I needed Printful and didn't even know I did until I found out about it. Makes printing and drop shipping a cinch, with a few hiccup here and there, but mainly because of interface than actual functionality. I can't wait to see where Printful goes, how it grows; the better it gets, the better my business can be for customers."
"Easy to install with nice clean interface to show the search results. Now both my blog and products show up in search results, nicely sectioned. Thanks for your good work :)
Love to have the function to show a collection of products based on groups (eg wholesale). This will make it even better app for us."
"Awesome. Great Interface, cool look!"
Simply the best search app around. Beautiful and easy to use interface. Highly customisable look and very responsive to search.
Changed our search interfaces drastically allowing customers to find what they are looking for more quickly leading to better conversion!
"The interface is easy enough for someone like myself to use. I have a hard enough time building a website and was expecting to have a similar experience, but found myself actually enjoying the whole process. I JUST started using this company and have yet to make a sale, but if they run their company as intelligently as their website is built - I'm expecting an awesome experience and hopefully a VERY long work relationship."
"LATER ADDITIONAL NOTE here at the top: I did go to Merchify and they are HEAVEN! They have the instant sync between the Shopify platform and their dashboard that this outfit, Printful, completely and sorely lacks. See the below and my glowing review at Merchify's app site: 
**************
I'm a card carrying member of MENSA and have subscribed to their magazine for decades. I also owned and operated a software company that sold around the world digitally in the 1990s long before it was fashionable with 4,000+ customers in 40+ countries around the world (including China, long before they hardly had any internet penetration). 
I know good software and I know bad software. And a large part of the determining factor of how good a software is less in the coding, and more in the user friendly simplicity and simple, straightforward instructional help. 
On this basis alone, not even to mention the fulfillment issues that others have noted below, I am finding this whole process a little terrifying. And like I mentioned above, I'm a member of MENSA and have been online since 1988.
The fulfillment issues warn me that if I manage to put in the hundreds of hours that it appears necessary to effectively interface with their cognitively disorganized mess of multiple videos here and there and everywhere vainly trying to point back to one of the most poorly designed ""dashboards"" that I have ever seen, that I'll be rewarded in the end by fulfillment problems that others here that have waded thru all of this have discovered. 
They escalated me to their head support guy and it hasn't improved much. When you have to be a professional graphics designer to do business with these companies, something is wrong. They haven't thought thru their business model properly to make it work with the masses of people out there. Native intelligence should be all that is necessary, not narrow professional training in a specific field. In today's world, good programming and good instructions should be able to make the latter no longer necessary. 
I am still looking at ThePrintful but I am now also looking at Merchify hoping that they might hold themselves to a higher standard. I'll probably be writing a review over there shortly. 
I am like another reviewer here in the sense that IF there is a DTG printer out there that has an APP out there with a dashboard that 
1. uploads the graphic in one place and has all of the variants and instructional videos and what not in one visual place to STEP BY STEP take the person thru the process instead of leaving GAPS AD INFINITUM in what actually needs to be done, let me know. 
2. Then uploads THEIR products into my Shopify store so that I can sell their products as affinity type items with my company's logo on it, 
LET ME KNOW!
I'll be there faster than you can say boo. :)
PS Their customer service and tech support is reasonably prompt and they try to be helpful, but I don't think they ""get"" how poor their interface is with the non-graphic-designer public."
"They have awesome customer support and a clean interface. Super easy to use, and can definitely generate more Sales"
This is a pretty cool app... great user interface and good support using live chat. Two thumbs up!  I highly recommend
"Nice bar, free. Can use it for any promo. One thing is that the apps user interface looks little messy, but hey its free and it works. 
www.sweatcraze.com"
"The Printful team is the best we have worked with to date! They are always there when we have a question, issue or concern. Further, they are actively updating their interface and services... all in all it makes for a great experience."
Its the perfect search bar for the most natural and reliable type of search. Its native response interface makes it almost fun for the end-user. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a serious search bar optimisation.
"App is easy to install and interface is really easy to understand.
Does what it suppose to do"
"This is a very straightforward, simple to use app that has exactly what I was looking for to complete my website and launch.
Likes:
The user interface
The display calendar felt friendly and usable 
I liked the option to have a drop down calendar
The support I received was very fast and reliable. They made sure even if something wasn’t working on my end that they would advise how I can change the code to change the location of the calendar.
Highly recommend this app."
"Simple install, takes seconds to setup, no editing code at all and a very simple user interface to customise text and colours to match your site.  Highly recommended.
See a live demo on our site at https://fruitycarrot.co.uk"
"easy to use!
simple interface!"
"Absolutely LOVE this app! Very easy to use. The interface could be less ""condensed"" but I give it 5 stars none-the-less."
"Great app! We are a flower store and having a calendar for us is essential.
The app is extremely easy to install and to use. The support team is also fantastic, always friendly and ready to help. I also enjoy extra features as multiple cut-offs times, easier for us to establish a convenient routine between the weekdays and weekends.
Overall, I am very pleased with this app, its simplicity, interface and usability. Thank you!"
"Simply does what they say! I would give 5 stars but had to remove one star coz their user interface and buttons are all kinda packed together.
With a better UI and layout this cud be a 5 star app!
Keep it up!
www.epicmoviestuff.com"
"This is a very well thought out app, the interface is clean and simple, customization is easy and the automation options are great. Very happy, thank you"
"An interesting way to reach your customers. Not sure how effective it is, but only time will tell. As for the interface and system, it's easy to use."
"Un GRAND MERCI particulièrement à RAMEEZ qui m'a pris en charge dès mon arrivé sur l'interface, pour me guider, me donner des astuces et des avantages. Les service est vraiment au TOP, sans parler de l'application qui semble trsè bien également. Très content de mon choix, je recommande +++ cette applciation!"
"I used this app to help us manage the order delivery schedule and available dates. I really like the interface and very easy to use. 
Did come across a problem for which 2 calendars were displayed on the checkout page. The problem was quickly solved via chat service. The customer service is awesome. thank you."
"App works great.  Coded very well so it loads quick at cart page, nice designed back-end interface, and detailed settings.   Happy ShopifyPlus customer."
"This apps just does what i was looking for. it's so amazing. I really like the interface, Thank you for your apps Guys.
Congrats"
"A very interactive set of people who have designed a convenient UI for multiple use scenarios. we continue to use it regularly to push messaging and are starting to see returns increase.
Hopefully, there will be a segmentation interface soon, that will help us create more relevant messaging. holding off one star for that."
So Far very Clean and straight forward! easy to use and intuitive interface
"Very happy so far. Have been using mailchimp for a few months and was not happy with it, only concern is that its a push notification but we will see. Just downloaded this minutes ago but can say I already like the interface more!"
"I have just started using the App. The interface is good compared to many other Apps. Easy to setup and use, the interface is great."
Very nice interface with a very easy to use dashboard. We definitely enjoy all the features that PushOwl provides.
"Super helpful staff! Real easy to install, I didn't have to blunder around with code. Interface is clean and it was pleasantly quick to figure out. I'm real tired of clunky programs. Oh, and it works great."
Excellent app! Simple interface. Works great! The support team is wonderful too and very responsive. We made some minor customizations to our cart page and the app team helped us get the cart page working better.
"The PushOwl app is a must-have for all e-commerce stores - whether it may be a small drop shipper or a large store. The team has been in touch with me since I installed the app 2 months ago. They have shared well-written articles on how to improve notifications as well as always been available via chat for any advice or issues. 
It is an extremely user-friendly app and is definitely the best & cheapest push-notifications app on the Shopify app store. The features are simple to comprehend and it's very easy to schedule the notifications. There's even a flash sale option and you can add images to your notifications - which is just brilliant! Overall, it has a professional interface and does increase traffic and sales onto your website. 
Thank You team PushOwl for all the help and wish you success!"
"An interesting way to reach your customers.  Not sure how effective it is, but only time will tell.  As for the interface and system, it's easy to use."
"I am using this app for a while and the customer support is really nice! I had a lot of questions in the beginning and every-time they helped me out. Thanks to all Customer Support agents, you're doing a great job! The user experience of Gempages is really nice and easy to understand. You can even use it without experience. A lot of great features and third app integrations. Really recommended!"
"I use Gempages for buildung my own Product- and Homepage for a better user experience. For that i first had to learn how this sidebuilder works. I must say, that after a time i understood the software very good! At the beginning i had some problems with the representation, because it was displayed me in a wise, nobody could understand. After that i have contacted ""Steve"" from the support an i must say this guy is brilliant! If you need any help, he can solve it in a few minutes. He is very friendly and a good partner to work!! I say that because i think you need a little time to do the work you want to do, and somebody who can help you. Nobody can understood everything from the first click. So here you go Steve. I like your support and everybody should know that your work is much better than i ever tought. Thanks for that! See you on the chat at Gempages, the best pagebuilder for shopify shops. This is serios.
I´ve tried ""Pagefly"" -> thats junk, believe me) 5 Stars for Steve (Support)
5 Stars for Gempages
5 Stars for usability ps: sry for my english.. i tried my best :D"
"Ok, so not only does this app boast a gorgeous user-friendly interface, but the staff are amazing as well!  I definitely recommend this app!"
"Awesome product simple and easy to use. Customer service is very friendly.
Highly recommend this product to anyone who wants an easy to use interface"
amazing app and amazing Support team one of the best apps I ever used moreover amazing features and easy and simple interface I totally recommend it
"I've been using gempages for months now and I love the easy-to-use interface and the flexibility to edit pages as a non-technical person. I've built all our site with them (homepage, product page, community and blog) and have been able to add advanced features such as accordions very easily. They also have an amazing customer support team that has helped along the way. Highly recommended!"
"after a week of usage I can say:
easy to use, 
clear interface, 
so far no sales thanks to it, 
expensive pro version:("
"Pushowl - An Amazing Customer Support, a very cool and functionally application which works so good. I love the Menu and the interface . It will helps me alot to grow my conversion . Thanks Owl Team for this amazing application"
"This is probably the best Push Notifications app out there. I am glad that I was one of the many lucky who got into the early stage program.
Three things I have really liked so far are:
1) The app works seamlessly on both desktop & mobile. It does what it says & does it very well. It's very simple to use the app interface & bonus it doesn't charge you anything for custom branding (with your logo).
2) Their pricing & service is very transparent. Unlike many other apps which claim to offer multiple ""free"" features and then limit users to restrictive options until they ultimately pay for the subscription. These guys are very honest about pricing & the features they offer.
3) Awesome customer service. Nothing impresses me as much as good support. I had a few queries and Shashank was pretty instant in helping me solve these small issues.
Overall, this is an amazing app that every Shopify store should have, period. :)"
Loving PushOwl so far! Love the way it integrates with Stamped.io. Love the user experience. Very clean and smooth. Great customer support!
"Very easy integration, very nice interface with a lot of detail. There seems to be no issues at all."
"I tried multiple different page builders when I was first getting started and GemPages by far had the best user experience—so I went with it, and I'm so happy I did. It's simple and easy to pick up on how to use it while still having a ton of capabilities and ways to set up robust pages/funnels to fit your needs. And their support is always super helpful. 10/10 recommend."
Love that I can make custom pages and their interface is very user friendly! So far so good and I look forward to making lots of beautiful pages!

Life saviour! Easy to use interface that allows you to add all the sections and customizable layouts to feel happy with your page's look. A great tool with a super nice customer support team
Very useful & easy to use interface.
"Great App! The interface is user friendly, so if you are a beginner, I will highly recommend it! If you have more experience, this app gives you an effortless way to implement custom HTML & CSS. And the most important is that they have excellent customer service, even based in Vietnam, your issue will be fixe under 24h."
"6/1/2021 - This is an updated review and I can't say enough good things about the support we receive with PushOwl, especially recently with Lucio. It is very easy to install. Also, whenever we have had a question or issue, the PushOwl team has responded very promptly and completely. We are particularly impressed with the fact that the app works seamlessly with Shopify. Five Stars for ease of installation, user interface, integration with Shopify and especially their customer service."
"I've been using gem pages since the beginning of my ecom journey and it worked wonders for me. I love the creative part of creating landingpages and gempages makes it just so easy to create all my ideas for a page.
And if there's a thing I don't manage to do I'll just contact them and within a few minutes to hours my problem is usually solved.
Also, the team's been really improving the app a lot all the time. I love the new Interface design and all the new integrations and new elements etc."
"The first thing I would like to say is that if you are considering any other similar app I strongly urge you to stop and get this right now! 
I was one of the first to give it a chance when there were very little reviews and have recently been using this a lot more now that I have developed more as a brand. 
The customer service is impeccable and the chat function brilliant, all questions will be answered immediately which is a huge plus as I was very nervous about it (sending notifications to people's personal devices is a big deal)
This app and the people who run it are very trustworthy and I have had no issues whatsoever. Again this is essential as you don't want anything going wrong when you are directly contacting customers. It's also stupid easy to use and has a sleek interface. 
Some Tips:
The boost in your sales WILL happen. Combine this with social media posts to accumulate subscribers and get a good 100 or so (you will get a lot more than you think) before doing your first push. I then watch on google analytics and see my web traffic spike, it's great! 
Another tip is to perhaps not automate it and send them manually so as to not overwhelm customers with each tweak of stock, this is available on the free plan. 
I am looking to upgrade as soon as I hit my next milestone of followers because the added features like sale signs etc. look great and you need to catch a customers attention or else they will swipe away. 
Don't be disheartened by the number of clicks either because I noticed a spike in traffic through people just googling my site rather than clicking the notification. 
Finally this was a god send during Black Friday, I sent out one message and my site flooded. Sold out everything I wanted to!  
I would just like to say a big thank you to the developers of this awesome app!"
Push Owl is awesome.  They even reached out to me with free tips on how to improve my interface and overall page to generate more conversions before I paid a dime for anything.  Awesome customer support!
Support staff is responsive and helpful. The user interface is easy to understand and great for beginners. The templates are nice too
"Perfect customer service, amazing features with simple interface. It has much more potential than email marketing!"
"Great support, quick problem-solving. Nice and friendly user interface for newcomers. Definitely recommend ;)"
"The support team has been very helpful with every question we've had, and the interface is extremely easy to use."
"Smooth interface , superb support from Kunal , couldnot ask more . Lets the ball rolling ."
"Installed with one click ✓ 
Beautiful user interface, very simple to use ✓
Customer service excellence ✓ (Very friendly with a touch of humor)
Tech support excellence ✓ (I enquired about back in stock notification on variant level and within 10 minutes tech support had spun up a brief support article)
I've only just installed this app so I will share performance at a later stage. For us 70% of traffic comes from iPhones, so once iPhones support web push notifications (hopefully soon) we will see great results from this app!"
"This app is a game changer for my marketing strategy! The user interface is beautiful, clean, and easy to use. The current features are amazing and I cannot wait for what is to come. So excited about being able to let my customers know I have new products in my store or let them know about a current promotion through a push notification. Even better is the cart abandonment. Emails just don't cut it anymore for cart abandonment. I highly recommend you give this app a try. 5 Star app and if I could give higher I would because Ankit is one of the best people I have encountered for customer service questions. Quick to respond and detailed. Ankit, is truly passionate about the app and does not give you the brush off like some customer service people do. You get treated like a person and not a paycheck. Stay Rowdy, in Style! - Rowdy Ann"
The response time on their support team is honestly the best I've seen. Very in-depth explanations and guidance with helping you build what you need to build. The app itself is simple and easy to use and has a great interface. 10/10 recommend
"We had stayed away from browser notifications earlier because integration used to be a pain, the interface was clunky and so on. PushOwl is fantastic! The UI/UX is great for both the merchant and the user. There is enough room for customisation, but, it is also very simple to use. We weren't very sure about how effective this would be as a marketing channel. But, our revenues have increased significantly since we started using this. We send out a notification every few days now. Most importantly, the folks who made this are very prompt in responding to issues and feature requests. Highly recommended!"
"I've been using the app for a while. What could I say... To be 100% transparent I'm giving it a try for the second time. For the first time, I was not able to comprehend the full potential of the app because I was a bit unfamiliar with the interface. But after investing tons of hours into the research of other options, I came to a conclusion, that GemPage definitely worth learning. If there is anything to learn per see... It appeared to be much simpler than I thought. 
OMG, the flexibility the app provides - it trumps any paid theme out there.
But that is not as cool as their support team. It turned out there was a minor conflict with my crazy expensive paid theme (which I do not need it now, hahaha). Their support has connected into my store and fixed it within a few minutes. That was a WOW factor.
Guys, you have 10 days for free to try. Just give it a try!"
It's a fairly good app. The interface is basic but is useful! Their chat service is great adn was able to help me take care of a problem fairly quickly.
"We've been using this app for a few months now and I have nothing but good things to say. The overall user experience is fantastic. The app is very intuitive and easy to use. And Gempage's customer support is amazing! They are very responsive, quick, and always happy to help. We wanted to add a feature that wasn't offered in the app and they immediately provided us with the html code. 
I highly recommend!"
Great user experience and customer support is straightforward!! Excellent app when it comes to creating your own landing pages
"I used this app to build our website. Fantastic app with great features. Dont need expert knowledge to use it as interface is very user-friendly. Most of the thing are just drag and drop, but if you need something more complicated- support team is always there to help you out. Would definitely recommend this app."
"I barely give reviews but I thought this app warrants one. I have built about 20 websites in the last 10 years, ranging from no code, simple sites using Wix, Weebly, to more complicated ones on Shopify. For the current website I am building, I needed a page designer functionality and I exhaustively studied and tried page builder apps on Shopify, testing each app's functionality and ""intuitiveness"". Overall, GemPages is the one that rose to the top because of the freedom it allows the ""semi-amateur"" designer to achieve a professional looking page. The interface is good, easy to understand, and it allowed me to achieve the exact prototype we were trying to match, initially built offsite during the brainstorming page."
"Easy, intuitive interface, and looks professional.  Very happy thanks!"
"This is a great drag and drop page builder, works seamlessly, and easy to learn interface. The customer service is Amazing!! Especially Cindy from the customer support has helped me with many things. 
This app is a must-have to increase the conversion rate."
GemPages is fantastic - it has the most intuitive user interface compared to other page builders and plenty of functionality and flexibility. The customer service is exceptional and I would recommend this to anyone looking to build their store efficiently and effectively :) Thank you!
"If you really want to build a direct response sales page for your shopify products without losing your sleep, then Gempages is the answer. I have been testing gem pages for last two months. Feature set is great. My shop landing pages are loading in less than 2 seconds. Gempages has lots of templates, i use their templates and modify it. 
Mobile optimization is good. I have lot of experience in webflow, Interface is not intuitive as webflow, with some work i'm able to accomplish exact layout and feel for mobile. Team is adding more templates regularly.
Customer support is great. They fixed my theme once to remove a google shopping error and also built a sticky cart button for mobile optimization.
Over all both the product and customer support is great. I would highly recommend it."
"I don't know where to begin!!
The app is extremely easy to use, the interface is user-friendly and you don't even have to be a coding-geek to build amazing production-scale websites. I am so lucky to have found GemPages as I believe the utilities they provide will significantly influence my business in the most positive way possible!
The customer service they provide is unmatched and they really do strive to bring you the best service. If you think about integrating this app into your store, think not twice!! 
Thank you GemPages, you've really been helpful."
I love the interface of Yotpo and the features are very useful. ALso chef kiss for the amaizing customer service
"I have used other page builders in the past. But none can compare to GemPages - From their user interface - to their amazing support team - everything is perfect. 5/5
Highly recomended!!!"
"The lack of variant options  has really been a battle but this is fantastic.  Our line is customizable and this makes the user interface easy.  Plus it was simple to install and get going.
Thank you"
"Simple, clean, easy, strengthens' trust, increases store conversion rates, a beautiful app for those who want to deliver an excellent user experience on any site. But what makes this app better is the great success support team who are polite, diligent and great at what they do!"
"Like Canva but for page building. Intuitive interface, very easy to use, support staff respond promptly."
"This is a FANTASTIC app with amazing customer service. I love the option to pay a small fee and have the set up done for you, although the instructions are so clear, it can easily be done on one's own. The app provides unparalleled flexibility in creating custom fields and the interface is intuitive. You can assign a field based on a product type, tag, vendor or a specific product (using handle or URL). There are 6 types of field options (text, checkbox, pull down, etc) and you have full control over the field title and instructional/placeholder text and can have default values and set it to required if need be.
The Better Reports app allows you to include data from the Infinite Options custom fields in reports! These two apps combined are game changers for Shopify users."
"I don't normally write reviews but this app has honestly baffled me and if you're thinking of switching to Yotpo, think again... It's meant to be one of the best review apps out there, which is why i migrated from stamped.io, but I really want someone to comment and explain to me WHY people are actually using this... The ONLY good thing i've found is extremely fast customer support, so I will grant them that one. But it seems like EVERYTHING you can do with a free to $20 app out there, you have to pay these guys HUNDREDS to be able to do, if not THOUSANDS! So I asked to have the following done, which is just standard for any other review app - and for every single one of these, they told me I needed to upgrade and pay MINIMUM $149 (sometimes even $8k ANNUALLY for some of these) just to get these BASIC features: 1) Show the ""average rating"" of my reviews (e.g. 4.7 stars) - HOW IS THIS NOT INCLUDED IN A $19 PLAN??? 2) Change the look of the interface (it looks terrible on the $19 plan, AND EVERY SINGLE review app, even free ones let you do this)
3) Show a VISIBLE ""sort by"" options for customers rather than their hidden one of the right hand corner that no one can see... What's more, EVERYTHING LITTLE CHANGE you do takes ""up to 24 hours"". And I'm not exaggerating when I say EVERYTHING. You want to delete a review? 24 hours...
You want to upload a review? 24 hours...
You want to change a setting for your reviews? 24 hours...
I could go on... I genuinely want to know, what makes this app able to charge you up to $8k annually to include basic features that other apps (e.g. stamped.io) can do for $20?? I cannot fathom it. I understand they may have features for the big guys making millions that other apps don't have, that's cool. But what about people just starting out?? Why do they need to pay hundreds for simple features that any other app can provide. I cam curious for a genuine response to this because I am truly amazed at how so many people have rated this 5 stars."
"Easy to use interface and superfast customer support, reached out to the team to remove branding and the issue got resolved in 5 mins."
It is very easy to use and the interface is very clean.  It would be great if we could decide the sequence of option.
"I've been using this app for a week now and have completely updated my site with it. The interface is so simple I picked it up in a day or two. I have modified every page on my store with ease and cannot believe I was using another page builder that is touted as the best but falls far short of GemPages. I have required support along the way and I can tell you these guys are #1. They answer every chat promptly and attend to every question. They have also helped me with some HTML code. 
Well done Team Success! Well done GemPages! I highly recommend GemPages!"
Great app for businesses! Easy interface and simple for beginners. This app is highly recommended!
"I'm a web designer by trade, and beginning to use this app seemed intuitive, easy, and fast. I loved it in the beginning. Shortly after, I had started gathering issues (integrating into Shopify Homepage, Product Element blocks not showing properly, widgets not completely loading in the gem builder, inconsistent viewing, and continuous bug after bug).
This is where it stopped being intuitive and straight annoying. A web designers apps and tools are everything to them. It's how I do my job. I found I couldn't depend on GemPages to properly execute my designs or support me with my problems when I needed them to, and for this, that is their BIGGEST flaw. 
That's why they have a two star rating. The interface is beautiful and the customization is endless. However, if you have deadlines and wish for support to fix your problems FIRST TIME AROUND, this app will do nothing but disappoint you."
"I was having some problems with publishing my very first page. Thankfully this app has a real - time customer support messaging system in place. The support team helped me a lot. Even on a Sunday! Now everything’s working! I can’t wait to make our new landing page. 
Clean and easy to use interface!! 
Hats off to Cris the app developer ❤️"
"We used this app to design our homepage and subpages. Easy to use interface and with great flexibility to adjust everything, value for money. Most importantly, swift response from support team - when we were having problem with the layout, superb!"
"Easy to use interface. It was hard to understand at first but once you realize you have two routes to go with this app, everything else becomes quite simple. 1.) link products from your store to amazon and let amazon do all the work and pay you commission. 2.) upcharge items and buy it yourself from amazon and ship to the buyers address."
"Great app!!! This app makes it so much easier to create your page to any sort of liking you want. Either take examples from their pre existing template or you can choose to create it all from scratch. The interface is so easy to use that a 3 year old can figure out and its wide range of customization makes it possible to create any bizarre them to your liking. Staff is friendly too, helped me out with any problem in a quick response! Next time you're thinking of buying a paid theme from shopify, try considering this app. Saves you loads of cash."
"I am happy to share such excellent software and user-friendly services.This software has helped me a lot of work, allowing me to better show my Shopify interface.
I really hope that more people will know about this app."
"I've used this app to build some of my website pages and it is GREAT! I tested all the web builders apps on Shopify, but I really like this one. It's an easy and clean drag and drop interface with lots of options and templates. But the most important they have a great support! Every time I didn't know how to do something they had a quick reply with an awesome customer service!"
"Infinite Options is a an easy to use tool that allows you to add custom forms fields to any or all of your products. Their interface works directly within Shopify and does not link you to another URL. However, where Infinite Options (ShopPad) shines is there customer service. Being a free app I did not expect to get much technical support - yet I got very fast support that solved my problem in one email! If you are looking for a way to customize your product/ service pages with option forms, Infinite Options is worth using!"
"I have been looking for a review plug-in that can upload pictures. This plug-in is very easy to use, the interface is very beautiful, and I am still configuring the template. Recommended."
"Absolutely amazing support: prompt reply, quick solution and excellent customer service. I couldn't add a widget code to my shop and it will be done from the Automizely side. The reviews section is easily customized to match shop interface. I use few more Automizely apps and it's always great choice."
"Hello Guys,
I really don’t submit reviews on the internet. When a product is good, I take it for granted, I consider that it’s the way it has to be. When it is bad, I just don’t want to lose my time working on it and I stop using it.
But, today, I would like to share my experience with Gempage!
This tool is really, really GREAT!
I’m a web developer. I make websites from Scratch, Wordpress, Online Builder, Shopify… I know a lot of solutions and apps to help people creating websites, but I have to tell that GEMPAGE is far ahead of all of them. 
Its user interface is simple and clear. 
Options are infinite, if you need something that doesn’t exist you can code it with liquid option directly. It’s really rare, you can do so much things with the original option.
I make make my store with it, page product with scarcity, counter, review...  Now, I'm playing making Funel with it... 
I mean your marketing and your store will LOVE IT!
Other things I really appreciate, is Gempage Support, which is just amazing.
Despite the delay, because they are located in Asia, these guys know what they are doing and are of very great help.
When I got a question, I always feel supported. They help me directly and are always open to implementing new features. 
This is just the beginning of GEMPAGE,I believe they are successful and that they are growing fast. I’m so glad to be an early adopter. 
For me, Free theme Shopify + Gempage are a WINNING combination."
Quick and efficient customer service! This app offers easy to navigate lay out with a easy to use app interface.
"This app has allowed me to create really professional looking pages with ease, simple drag and drop interface and packed with loads of really useful features, I love using it! I cannot recommend it enough. Check out my site to see what you can do https://vitasupps.us/"
"Great customer service, helped me fix issues I had with my page. Very easy to use interface, you can just drag and drop elements into the sections you want."
"gempages are super user friendly, the interface is beautiful, simple, and easy to use. i love the ability to fully customize the page to my liking. highly recommend this app"
"This tool is exactly what I have been looking for.  As a User Experience designer for my day job, I want control over details, but I don't want to get into the weeds of coding for my own website.  GemPages is both powerful and easy.  This team has done a wonderful job producing this tool.  I look forward to working with them for years to come."
"So far, as I set things up to get my site up and running, any questions I've had, no matter how mundane, have been answered in a way that is very easy to understand. They obviously know their product and how it interfaces with different websites. They are good at dealing with people who have no knowledge of html and at explaining what needs to be done next. 
   I'd definitely recommend the product and the people to others."
"This app needs to be #1 in the app store...
There is almost no limits on the interface and you have pretty much full control over your sites appearance. I had used this originally to get past the restrictions on my home page but now I use it for landing pages and all sorts of things. 
Im not quite sure why so many dropshippers praise Hypervisual when something like this runs circles around it with no bugs or gimmicks (at least since i have been using it for about 8 months)
I would recommend this app any day of the week."
"This app made it easy to add personalization options to my products and created a better user experience than my previous set up that only had a ""notes to seller"" option at checkout. It was easy to install and set up. I'm thinking about getting Uploadery as well, so I love that I could try this app for free to try out a ShopPad app.
Couple of things I learned:
• The labels under settings show up on the user's cart page, so use customer-friendly labels.
• I also followed the install instructions on the dashboard to show the user's entered options at checkout and ended up with a duplicate copy of the options. Guess my theme (Supply) already had the appropriate code to make the options show up. It was easy enough to remove.
Thanks, ShopPad!"
Good customer service. The app interface could be a bit more user friendly though and there are delays with publishing reviews
"I have tried almost every page builder app in the marketplace. So far, this app has the highest functionality as well as the best user interface. I have also needed support several times and they are always very quick to help me! I recommend this app!"
"I have tried many different page builders from shopify (eg. shogun, pagefly, etc) and definitely found gempages to be the best. The interface is very user friendly, and anyone can design a great website like a professional using gempages. 
The support is great, and they are quick to respond and help with any problems you have designing your site. 
Gempages is definitely the best page builder out there right now, I don't know what I'd do with out it!! Dont bother looking elsewhere! 
Thanks to the gempage team for creating this app! :)"
"Satisfied, the app is really useful and has a supereasy interface. The import of the reviews works perfectly. Support is very helpful and quick. Suggestion: I would like to customize a little more the style of the email sent to the Clients, but it's already a good level of customization."
"The app is almost perfect, we like it a lot, very considerate the support center, can seen is use to design with user experience in mind. Thanks for the amazing app"
Amazing product and customer service. We use this mainly to build our product pages and find this adds a nice differentiation from the standard theme templates. Really easy drag-and-drop interface and they've continued to support and develop the tools. They've added undo features most recently and it has taken this app from good to great. Highly highly recommend!
"Very easy to use with templates and many elements to create a custom page quickly. The pages are responsive also which is great. Can quickly get started using as has an intuitive interface. The dashboard is very helpful to manage pages. I like it very much. Lastly, the support offered is superb and always to the point."
"Infinite Options, Literally speaks for itself. You can add anything you like to your website; from a sales point of view creating Adverts/Listings adds endless possibilities. Similar to eBays Item specifics even, but much nicer and more customisable. The interface is smooth and clean, crispy with excellent customer service. Very helpful, informative staff that want the best for your site. I highly recommend this app to all, It’s easy to install and makes your website much more intractable for customer. Does what it says on the tin, and then a whole lot more!"
nice and easy to use user interface. I highly recommend
Junalou was extremely helpful in assisting me to set up the app. Excellent customer service. App interface is somewhat clunky and challenging to navigate. Preview pages appear fairly inaccurate.
"Gem Pages is an awesome way to customize the look and interface of your store. It is so easy to use, and you don't have to have any coding or design experience to make each page look great.
We love the instant message feature for support. Anytime we've had an issue, Chris and his team have been on it right away.
Would highly recommend Gem Pages!"
"Lots of good features and very responsive over chat, very easy interface to use and not a big learning curve."
This app what exactly what I was looking for. A simple way to add custom forms for different Shopify products. It has all the custom options you should need in a simple to use interface. The customer service it outstanding. I gave them access to my admin and they were able to add in some functionality for my theme within two business days.
"Very intuitive and easy to use interface that installed on my site with no effort, seamlessly integrated into my theme. I had thought offering mix-n-match options would take custom development so had put it off... only to find this app and have it up and running in under an hour - with a sale on the product within a few hours. Great experience. I wish I found it earlier.

A really great app that lets you easily design and manage Shopify pages with a simple and accurate drag and drop interface. Perfect for quickly developing professional Shopify pages and adding bespoke sections. The customer support is excellent. Janie and the team responded really quickly to my query with a friendly knowledgable response.
"Very quick to setup and exactly what i was looking for. Must have for Amazon Affiliates!  Just import amazon products to my shopify store with my Amazon Affiliate ID attached. Also changes checkout button to View on Amazon. Appreciate that it is affordable and has a clean interface. I can also go back in and edit the product title and details for seo.

Amazing feature-rich app that gets updated regularly. The whole interface with GemPages is intuitive and the drag & drop functionality makes building or modifying any webpage a breeze. We've practically built our entire site with the help of GemPages. This is a MUST have app for anyone who wants to build custom pages for their website.
Gempage allowed me to develop all my product pages with a disconcerting ease. I really recommend it because its interface is much simpler and pleasant to use compared to other page creators. 5 deserved stars
"This is a fantastic app for creating large numbers of variances for my products.  It was easy to install with a user-friendly interface.  I encountered a little difficulty adding some code required for it, but that was quickly resolved with Shop Pad's fabulous customer service, and it was even the SAME business day!  I highly recommend this app!"
APP is excellent . Interface is simple and clever .Support is Highest Level .Chris helps in all issues . Enjoy it and be Happy . This app is all you need for design your pages !!!! 5+Stars
"I'm not a tech guy--I'm a marketing guy.  There's one thing that was insanely frustrating to me, and that was the seemingly rigid interface of Shopify and needing to know liquid code to make any changes.  I hated it.  So  switched over to Wordpress and tried to rebuild my eCommerce site, but the delays and latency issues were equally as frustrating.  So, I went back to Shopify and was going to hire a web designer.  Shopify is AWESOME for zero latency page loads, analytics, and the excellent  interfacing with Social Media platforms.
I didn't need to hire a web designer.  I somehow stumbled across GemPages and built an amazing website with ease on the Shopify platform.  This app saved us countless thousands of dollars, we have an amazing looking site, and if there is anything I can't figure out it seems as through Chris is just a chat question away from fixing it.  I love this app.  It will be the best eCommerce investment you will make.  Love the app and the tech support!  Thanks Chris!!!!!!!!"
Awesome app. User friendly. Simple interface! Best recommended and being using other Automizely apps.
"Super useful, easy to set up, and very user friendly interface :) looks awesome on my store"
Great app to import reviews and collect reviews from our recent customers. The interface is beginner-friendly. A great alternative to Loox Reviews.
Great customer support! Very helpful and timely responses. Easy-to-navigate interface. No complaints here.
"Amazing app! So cool and easy interface, nice and creatives bars! Thanks^^"
"This is a great app!  I was able to use it immediately without having to read a ton of help guides and materials.  It's super easy to use, the interface is very intuitive and the pages it produces are awesome and look professional.  I'm using their free version, which is very generous.  And I look forward to upgrading to their professional version once I have a need for more pages. I'm so happy I found this!"
"Do you struggle with pages that don't look good in your current Shopify theme?
Are you tired of spending hours editing code, and investing thousands of $$$ in developing your pages?
Then you need GemPages!
I gotta admit, I was hesitant with installing it. I did try so many other ways to edit my pages, and my frustration was skyrocketed, but I figured I give GemPages a chance.
Completely new to this I needed some pointers to get me starting. Their dashboard is really nice, but I ended up contacting their customer service.
Do these people sleep? No matter the time of the day I always get quick responses. I secretly think that Chris is a human fused with AI. His expertise is beyond anything I've experienced with Shopify.
Did I get paid to write this review? No, not at all, but I will recommend it to everyone I meet. I have 100% faith in Chris and his team. Every Shopify owner should have this app installed.
If you haven't installed it by now, I don't understand what you are waiting for, but ok I'll sum it up.
5/5 - Smooth design, totally got that popular startup-feeling that is popular now.
5/5 - Unbelievable support team - 24/7 service, literally. They puts my customer service to shame.
5/5 - User interface, nothing is compared on the market, as far as I known, and I've tried a variety of UI's the UX in this one is out of this world.
5/5 - Free Version, yeah it's a trial, but the pro version is so worth it. I'm upgrading mine today as we speak.
Blocksplash is a global digital disruptor and works with businesses to reshape their business models. We recommend GemPages to all of our clients."
Easy to implement. No issues. Love their live chat support! User experience is smooth and loads fast.
"Great application, easy and powerful. You quickly get a ton of videos and photos that can be used in ads. The interface is super simple ( and I've tried a lot of apps) and the customer service is amazing!
I recommend 100%."
This is a great app! It helped me create a page exactly how i wanted it to look with ease! It has a very easy to use drag and drop interface with a lot of customizability! Their support is also fantastic and got back to me within 2 minutes of contacting them! I highly recommend!
"Very happy with GemPages, I had previously explored other page builders and find GemPages the easiest, cleanest and most intuitive interface. Chris from support is excellent. Templates are awesome, plus a wealth of useful hints and tips on building landing pages, product pages, marketing products etc. 
I am enjoying the extra dimension of creative freedom this app gives to the web design process.

customer service is amazing an has helped me facing some issues along the way for my website review interface
"Using Yotpo has been great for our store. The interface is very easy to navigate and the customer service, particularly James and Manny, is always very responsive and helpful!"
"Always helpful, quick responses from the Yotpo support team. My questions are always answered and Yotpo interface is very easy to use."
"This has by far been the best customer service with any of the apps i have downloaded at shopify. 
Not only is gem pages a great page builder with a very simple interface, which is easy to learn and extreme versatile with the tools, but the customer support to help you get what you need done is incomparable.
i usually never write reviews and this is my first one ever, but i really feel the need to mention how helpful, courteous and since the support was compared to many apps that doen respond to you for days. A happy paying customer getting more than their moneys worth!"
"I'm from www.loveanddesign.com
Chris is just Brilliant and the support is there. I've been using Gem pages for a while, started off building a nicer Contact us page etc. I've just completed our home page with it, we have an incredibly easy accordion menu that you just couldn't do with the $180 theme I bought.
It's great for stores where you want to innovate because it gives you much more access to building blocks, but with the simplicity you need if you're a beginner.
I am actually a developer myself but I can't tell you how much time this product has saved me. At last I can actually build really interactive, exciting interfaces for my customers to enjoy and to drive sales.
I can't WAIT for the sales funnels package that's coming soon.
Great product, great support. 
11 out of 10."
I decided on this app because it has a easy interface and I am able to import reviews. I wanted to add reviews to my website for customers to leave and this was the easiest possible.
"CJ has a very good interface, the support is fast, and the agent Simon is available, fast and gives good informations."
Very well designed app with lots of easy to use features. It brought a clean buyers reviews interface to our store. Recommended.
Fera has a fantastic interface that is really easy to set up. We have used them to replace our reviews section and it not only looks beautiful but is very convenient for our customers to receive coupons and promos for writing reviews.
"I am very impressed by the 1on1 engagement with my assigned agent. I had a unique sku setup request (multiples of one sku for buy more save more promotion). My agent was extremely responsive and took care of it on the backend in CJ. The CJ app interface takes a bit getting use. That is the weakest point for them. If the addres this, then I would say wow. but the service and timely responses are amazing. Makes you feel like you have a vested partner at each step with CJ."
Amazing review app. Was easily able to import reviews onto my store and also manage my reviews in their interface
"Though im new, the platform is, so far, a step-up from aliexpress, in that the sourcing of products, fulfillment, and support is all integrated into a fairly user friendly user interface."
"I loved this app! Great App. Got much value for free. Easy to import review, and great interface. Easy to y use and user friendly . You definitely recommend to all those starting new and trying to save cost"
"Very easy to use, customer service is also very patient! The display interface is beautiful. And it's free, it's worth having."
"I've installed multiple review widgets, and this one is by far the easiest to use. I started on etsy and am slowly moving over to Shopify and importing my reviews has been extremely difficult. I still have to add them one by one, but the interface of Fera is very user friendly and super easy to use. Highly recommend"
"The support is great it responds quickly and resolves all problems, the app itself does the job fairly well with an amazing interface. Easy to set up, use & update 9/10"
"Junalou was super helpful in helping me get a reviews page up on my website! When I thought we were done, she even shared a recommendation to help improve my user experience by adding reviews to my catalog page AND walked me through how to install the code! Very pleased with the customer service I received today."
I've used this app to add testimonials to cart page and to up sell. App has intuitive interface and does not slow the store down much.
Manny was very helpful with my request today and went above and beyond to make changes to my site to ensure a smooth and clean user experience. I really like the free plan as a small brand which helps gain customer trust!
User friendly interface & fast support from live chat. Recommended to add into e-commerce store. Good job
Super clean setup. Super clean user experience. Solid app! Checkout myluvbox.com
This app was a great addition to our Shopify store. Postscript has an easy-to-use interface and their support team is top notch.
"Amazing tool! The interface is modern and sleek and mostly intuitive - and will get better with time.
I had my doubts of course but the integration options are unbelievable and I have never seen something like it. 
I am also missing SIZE charts option in their app, expecting to have the same in the app at earliest.
I highly recommend this product and have just bought SR for my other region website also.
Lastly i would like to add that SR guys are fanatical in their support and got everything squared away!
Thanks SalesRocket !!"
Great app - Tyler was great. I would highly recommend getting this app. Super easy interface and great customer service.
"Easy to use, great interface - love this app! Can't recommend it highly enough! We use it on StandardRazors.com and it works flawlessly."
"This is a great reviews app, love the user interface very easy to use. Comes with a 14 day free trial so you can always test it out before paying for it."
"I just wanted to display the stock left ...  I tried the changing the Shopify code but, wouldn't work, Tried another App, wouldn't work. tried Sales Rocket, worked first try!
Nice work guys, this is everything a Shopify App should be. Click the 'Install' button and work your way through the extremely intuitive interface. Or not! It's set up so well you really don't need to change anything.
I don't mind paying for Apps like this.
Charlie"
"Easy to use, clean interface and delivers exactly what I was looking for. I would recommend this to anyway looking to build store credibility."
"I run a yarn shop. We want our customers to be able to see how many skeins of a particular yarn are available; if they need five skeins to make a sweater, it's less frustrating for to be able to see what their available options are than to have to try to add it to the cart. Shopify doesn't have this functionality. The ""scarcity"" settings on this allowed us to do exactly what we were trying to do, with an eye-catching interface. Thank you!"
I tried out a few product review apps before settling on Fera. I love the interface its very easy to learn and use. I like that unlike the others you can manually add reviews which helps since I send free items to influencers who may not traditionally purchase through checkout but I want to still add their feedback so LOVE this app!! 5 STARS!
Just installed and it seems great. The interface may be a little over complex. It's bulky but there are a ton of options for customization. So in that way it's great. Plus for a free app it has a lot to offer!
"Outstanding customer service. We were using another review service that wasn't terrible, but their customer support was unacceptable. So I found Fera, and they went above and beyond to help me. My CSV file had a couple errors and I requested help to fix my file. Holden fixed everything, and looks amazing. The layout is super clean and love the interface. Thank you!"
So far the app is great! It will be able to replace several apps I'm using. Interface is also very nice and fits my branding well
"Ridiculously easy to install and utilise. I was able to import all my reviews from a previous platform. I had an issue installing a widget into the code, but Holden and Kopila from the customer service team were able to assist and fix it within moments. Very happy with the Fera user interface and ease of use."
Excellent work done on this app welldone and great interface...however there should be customize option for font & size change.
"I recommend this application to all users of the shopify platform.
The application offers an easy and intuitive interface for manipulating.
An excellence application."
"Excellent App! It provides a simple yet great looking bar popup for your website.
They give you the app for free which comes with full functionality, but there is extra features that you can pay to apply. Overall this is a must-have for your site. It's just an extra feature that you should add, to enhance the user experience and add volume to your landing page.

"Support is amazing!! They have the best review app, best interface, and they are not charging $100'ss for it. BEST LOOKING WIDGETS ALSO."
I love how many features this app provides. Really an all in one-stop when considering apps to do things like increase social proof and create urgency. Highly recommend this app as you can do so much within a single easy to use interface!
Very fast and great customer service. Also a nice and easy interface and fast setup. Overall great app!
Great app. Good interface and customer support. Kind of weird I could not end free trial early to go ahead an upgrade though.
"I found Yotpo and installed it in my store. Amazingly this application is really the best application. User Interface easiest to understand and maintain, Customer support 10/10. I highly recommend it for the other users too."
"Great product - I love the integration; it really makes a big difference in sales and engagement; good value and user interface; and very, very helpful team. Hoping they integrate with more email platforms than Klaviyo, but for a good deal for Shopify SMS/MMS, it can't be beat!"
Super easy to set up and the support is top notch! Great interface and really intuitive! Integrates with Klaviyo rally well!
"As with many apps, it really helps to know at least some basic HTML code. Fortunately, Yotpo has a pretty user-friendly interface that does take a little time getting used to, but because the forums and support are so incredible, I never feel stressed out. Eric and Anne have both helped me resolve issues very quickly that would have taken me much longer to resolve, especially design issues and learning how to integrate product reviews on product pages. Their chat is available 24/7. What I love about the app are some of the features that really upscale the feel of my website, like the persistent review tab and review carousel. The other great aspect is the integration with social media. My reviews are integrated into Facebook and Yotpo will post automatically to remind my customers (and potential customers) to buy products that others have reviewed. And most importantly, it has helped to increase my sales. I would definitely recommend this app."
"I switched from a different app to Yotpo, mostly for reviews functions. By far the best customer service experience I have had with any shopify app. They helped me through installation, getting the widget to appear the way I want it on my website. They answered all my questions promptly and fully (always within 24 hours, sometimes quicker). The interface is easy to manage. I am happy with the website's move to Yotpo."
"Before this I had the Shopify review app, but I found it very little in terms of design and possibilities. there were three on my list, Judgeme, Stamped and Fera. Fera was finally chosen because this app also offers other options. Stamped is very nice in terms of interface and really focused on customer reviews, and many different widget options. I miss that with Fera, the widget design options. And lastly, at Fera the customer receives an email if he or she wants to leave a review, but that goes via a link in the same email, while Stamped and Judgeme have already processed that in their email, so one step less for the customer. . It should be so simple and fast for the customer and Fera should also integrate that service. All in all, Fera has won for its minimalist design and easy interface plus many additional other services that they offer."
"Awesome app. It is super simple to install and configure, nice and clean interface and great functionality. If you are looking for a great SMS Marketing app, definitely this is the one to go. And super fast and responsive support team. Ran into an issue with an integration and the team got it resolved quickly and made sure all is working as we wanted it. Also the app has all the key integrations in our tech stack for our store, so it is a perfect match and highly recommended."
"This app is great, it is simple to use, integrates easily with existing review apps such as yotpo and has a great interface"
I love the interface is easy to Use than Alireviews and it is free to now. The perfect app for at no cost. The support was fast enough to reply to my concerns. I would recommend 100%
a great app and a great customer service team. App is Easy to install and use and it has good user experience
"Fera is an interesting app with lots of useful features. We're still learning and testing it out, but it seems to already improve the conversion rate and bottom line. We did some testing versus other apps in the same category, and Fera seems better and with more options than most of them. We were also happy with the user experience and the great personal support and help that we got!"
"The app has saved me so much time, i really like this app, very easy to use, very nice user interface."
"Easy to install app and interface was easy to use, hope it remains free as i can use this in the long run. Very good and helpful app it makes my site look professional."
"Easy to install app and interface was easy to use, hope it remains free as i can use this in the long run.  Very good and helpful app it makes my site look professional."
This app increased conversions for me and was really easy and simple to use. Set up was laid out clearly as well! I enjoyed the simply laid out interface and the ability to organize my descriptions in a visually appealing way.
"Two ecommerce owners recommended this app to me and so far so good. The interface is super easy to use, fun, and has good analytics. I also like the chat feature! I deleted something by accident and a rep was very helpful in solving my issue."
Kinda confusing but I’m trying to get it to work for me. Nice interface can’t wait to see how it works for my shop thehoneydripp.com
Easily user interface. I can easily customize my shipping bar to how I want it to look.
I've had this app for a while now. It's the best SMS app out there hands down. The interface is easy to use and the customer service is top notch. They always answer questions really quickly!
"Such a huge time saver when you have hundreds of skus like we do. Easy interface, and their other apps are golden as well."
"For 5 mins I did what I wanted and tried for 3 hours with other apps. Nice interface, many options. Recommended"
"I use this app for markdown scheduling and sales, cleaning up collections, and bulk-editing tags. Really great interface, straight-forward and user-friendly. The only thing that would enhance it is if you were able to import CSVs for the product list to edit."
Great app. Clean interface and robust functionality. Huge time save. Plus the ability to backup and revert tasks is huge if you need to rollback. Must have if you don' feel like messing around with CSV's all the time. Great customer service too.
"Awesome! Easy to use, love the interface. Excited to see what it can do for my store! Offers a lot of things for only $9/month : )"
"Amazing customer service! Super responsive and very helpful! Highly recommend the app, great user interface and easy to use!"
Seems easy to use and fully customizable. I would suggest that is picks it's colors form the template being used so it does not look like an add-on but rather part of the interface.
I love how easy the interface is to use. I look forward to more apps from them!
"I've just downloaded this app 2weeks ago, and I find that the interface is easy to use and the customer service's turnaround time is very quick and friendly."
Works well and has saved me a time or two. Really like the undo feature. The interface could use some work to be more responsive design friendly.
"We have been using Yotpo for around 6 months. The consumer facing functionality and aesthetics are great, and the admin interface is intuitive/ easy to use. Particularly impressed with the customer service team who respond in seconds, are extremely knowlegable/ capable and always helpful."
"Great app! Love the interface. Great for automation. Highly recommend for anyone who likes high open rates! - Jeff, CEO"
"Smart Tabs is one of the best apps I've installed to date. The interface is seamless and loaded with integrations which make it easy to manage....A must have if you're serious about customer relations.
thanks a bunch to the team!"
"So far so good! I was looking for a full service SMS system and this is it! They have all of the SMS marketing tools already built in and the interface is clean and easy to use. The conversion rate for the various settings, like for when customers first subscribe has been pretty darn good so far too! Also, I used a different platform before and they did not have half these features and charged way more! I can't wait to start sending out campaigns!"
"Customer service is at the highest level, and they get things done QUICKLY! Interface is easy to use and edit to personalize for your own store."
"Switched over to PostScript after using a competitor's service for years, this platform is far superior. Not only are the interface and functionality amazing, but the support is phenomenal. Anything we need, we're able to get concierge-level support on the spot. Amazing app and team!"
Postscript is a great SMS app with a nice interface. Easy to use and great support via chat. I use many of these type of apps and this is a top choice.
"Still in the free trial phase but we're loving it! As a store, we're new to SMS marketing and Postscript has made the transition to this new medium incredibly seamless and easy. 
Their interface is very straightforward and simple to use and you'll be up and running in no time. Plus their website is full of tips and tricks and when in doubt, their live chat is the best. Always incredibly responsive, no waiting, and very friendly. If you're lucky enough to work with Shannon, she's one of the best people I've ever worked with on a live chat platform. 
Like I said, we're still new to SMS Marketing and Postscript, but so far, so good. We've even had other SMS companies reach out and try to snag us away but Postscript has everything we need and more between automation, segmentation, campaigns, creativity, and integration with existing apps."
"Postscript has been the best user experience out of any app! Their entire team has been proactive to assist me in getting started & show me any tips to maximize their platform for SMS.
Also, if you ever have any questions, their customer support answers & resolves your questions within 5 minutes...
Highly recommend. You'd be a fool to go elsewhere!"
"Great app! Easy to use interface, using it to boost sales on a brand new shopify store. So far so good!"
"Super easy to install, with a sleek and clean interface! Just installed it, so hopefully, this increases revenue for my publishing website at (higginspublishing.com) Thanks!"
We've tried nearly every SMS and all of their interfaces suck. This one is incredible and fantastic customer service and automations.
Great app! Great interface and customization. Using the Free Shipping Bar and Flash Sale Timer Support is super helpful as well!
"Cool product, lot of options, good interface, easy integration but you can do deeper with the code, i recommend"
"*UPDATE 05-22-2020*
YotPo reached out to me following my review and extended out options to improve my experience. I am a firm believer of customer service and I believe I would do injustice to not adjust my review to a full 5 stars for a great app paired by service that follows-through.
-----------------------------------
Yotpo has incredible customer service and have helped me with numerous issues for my site. I've had questions and issues that I've discussed with them at weird times of day and they always have someone there to respond and provide support (shoutouts to Mary Ann and Josephine who are among the names I remember working with who were absolutely amazing). I would list them as one of the top Shopify apps with top-notch customer service. 
The only reason I placed it at a 4 out of 5 is that I personally think YotPo could be more competitive with its features for the price it is charging as it is actually one of my ""pricier"" Shopify apps I currently have on my store. I am paying for the $29/month plan but still have a ""Powered by Yotpo"" shown on my website in the reviews section and if a customer that purchases my product loses my automatic review request email, my plan does not allow me to send a manual email review request. The product page review section also does not allow for customer to upload their photo, photo uploads can only be performed through the email review request system. 
Besides those items, the interface is clean. The set up is very intuitive. The presentation on the website looks great."
"It seems like a useful app. Haven't used it yet, but it would be useful to group different data in different tabs to make the interface looks clean. Best, teenie"
"In providing a clean interface for our customers we chose Tabs Free. The product is full of implementable features for integrating all sorts of information within the placement of the App to display for your customers reference. 
It's also Great that the app is free which is Super for stores that are continuously under development to make a successful mark in the ever growing retail industry. 
However; their is a technical concern upon how ads and a timer is recycled prompting a positive review that resides within our stores admin upon the installation of the App. It is not inviting more so intrusive and unwanted on our behalf. 
We understand the importance of the purpose being necessary to keep the Tabs App Free for all, but we encourage the developers to look into a more inviting way to promote instead of bombarding the Stores Admin
with ads and timers.
The Tabs App has been residing on our site for over a month now with minor technical issues. We are content with the performance and look
forward to the continue use and upgrade of the Tabs App.
To the Tabs App Creators & Developers;
Thank You!
Best Regards & Prosperity
The Basic Point | Home Goods & Apparel"
"Postscript is heads-and-shoulders above the competition. The best SMS app overall. Clean interface, quick revenue, easy integrations and GREAT customer service. Have never had to wait for answers to any of my questions. Highly recommend."
I use this app to keep our products organised. Creates a better user experience. I recommend using if you like things tidy.
"Easy to user interface, stellar customer service (Zev is the man!) and I am already seeing some nice conversions for my store. Can't go wrong with Postscript"
Really professional App with a great interface. It's definitely helping me create urgency and I think the fact that they keep it free for startups is really admirable and awesome. Thank you!
"Excellent App and support. Being able to collect customer reviews and have them published onto my website is a huge benefit. I look forward to taking advantages of many of the other services too. A simple to use interface, however there was always extremely helpful support team member available whenever I required any assistance. I can not rate them highly enough"
"Great app, easy to use interface with lots of customization options. When there's something that wasn't intuitive, customer service was quick to respond and help."
"Very useful app, saves a lot of time for bulk editing, quick responses from the developer and the interface is easy to use.  Great!"
"Muy buena aplicación me ha gustado su interface, fácil de usar muchas gracias AAA+++
muchas gracias."
This app is awesome. I used it to add a sense of urgency for my products on sale. It has a user-friendly interface and looks very clean when applied on my site.  Would def recommend this!
Love the simplicity of using this app. Easy to get the tabs to self populate in product pages. Will update further on the user experience.
"I have not had any need to use this app's support team yet but judging by the slick and easy to use interface as well as the reliability of it's functions I imagine the help I would receive would be just as fantastic! 
Great app, we would highly recommend it to anyone with a large number of products. Our store will have thousands of products eventually and already has many hundreds so this app is an essential tool for us!"
Postscript is a fantastic app that easily allowed us to integrate text marketing to our business and we have seen a huge ROI. The interface is user-friendly and easy to use and the support throughout set up and after has been stellar. They are quick to answer questions and help you make the most of your plan.
"I have used the Bulk Product Edit app for more than a year now. My shop (DV8s.com) has a few thousand garments. Correcting errors or making revisions to 100 or more products at a time is quite common for me. I don't know how I could possibly make the changes I require without the Bulk Product Edit app. It has already saved me literally hundreds of man-hours of tedious labor.
The interface is intuitive and laid out in a common-sense, logical way that will have beginners feeling comfortable with it after only a few uses. Whenever I have had any questions, the support staff has always been prompt, professional and eager to assist.
Further, this is not one of those ‘dead in the water’ apps that is rarely or never updated. Hextom is constantly improving it and adding new and useful features.
The funny thing is that when I originally installed it, I thought the $14.99 monthly charge was a bit on the expensive side. I could not have been more wrong. It is worth much more to me. If you have more than 100 or so products in your shop, this app is a “must have”.
I am not the type of person who gives praise easily, but Bulk Product Edit has earned a 5-star review.
Finally, for the cynical amongst us – that includes me – I do not know anyone at Hextom, nor do I stand to profit in any way from this review."
The interface of the app isn't as user friendly as it could be BUT the customer support they provide through Live Chat is A*! Super helpful and incredibly capable.
"Interface is cluttered, and the software was constantly buggy. When issues came up, support didn't seem to know what was going on and wasn't helpful. Didn't seem like they cared at all.
Price is very high, and order caps are low. If it was totally bug-free and functional, and support was awesome, we'd pay the price, but it's just not worth it for us."
WYSIWYG interface makes FSB super fun and uber simple to use.
"The best app for running text campaigns, without a doubt. Easy interface, very responsive support team, and lots of great features. I'd recommend to anyone."
"well. its true, its functional and save allot of time, 
but its interface is terrible, its product selection is ok, but need to be more flexible .
(need to exclude manually products selection after filtering, need have product counting in the list, need to have display per page, and much more...)
but in general, its very useful.
thanks BPE"
Great prices and some of the fastest tech support I've seen for a Shopify app. Interface is nice. So far so good!
"hmm. Im still looking for a proper product editor.
all we get from shopify and oberlo is junk.
I feel like Im the slave on their fancy boat,
tagging/filtering/sorting manually. 
well... this app suppose to reduce manual work... well... sort off.
its unbelievable how much crap we get in the description of a product,
and with this Bulk product edit, it does make it just a tiny bit easier , but defenitly not worth the money, unless it falls right into your style of managing your product.
i found out that after using all the filters i still get products i wanna get off the list,
and it doesnt let me do it manually . (well, i dont realy manuals, so maybe there is some magic button, which i dont know, but hmm as long as it not obvious - it a fault interface/work flow  design .
oh and the collections doesnt update,when you add a collection. yay.
can any1 do a proper product editor please please please please  ???"
"A great app with a simple, user-friendly interface.
Price is a bit steep, but it does help to save users lots of time from manually editing large volumes of product, which is nice."
I used this app to make the customer's experience better. The user interface is certainly part of the buyer's journey.
Super easy and intuitive interface. Have been using for almost an year. Lot of customization is possible.
Great app...works like magic and easy to use interface.
"At the beginning I was really suspicious about this app, especially because of the lack of reviews it had, but I installed it anyways due to a recommendation of someone I know. Although the interface and use of the app was really intuitive, it didn't work out for my website the first time, I was really dissapointed and I had to contact support, but then everything worked just fine. Although I had a problem integrating this with another app (langify), the support crew (Eligijus) was really responsive and they even helped me with another issues. Now it works fine and really improved my product pages!
100% recommendable!"
"Thrilled with our Postscript experience. Seamless integration, solid user interface, exceptional customer service. Shannon & their entire CX team is top notch. Highly recommend."
"I love this app and the people behind it! Their support team is the best I have encountered with a Shopify app.  We are all new to the world of SMS marketing, and their onboarding team made it easy to understand best practices and get campaigns up and running fast. The interface is easy to use, and we are so happy with our experience."
Really easy to use interface and EXCELLENT customer service. Highly recommended for a Shopify site.
"Fantastic results. Fantastic interface. Fantastic support.
My favorite Shopify app by a wide margin!"
Support for Postscript has been great thus far and the interface is easy to use! We have multiple shops and use it for all.
"Super user friendly, exceptional customer service, intuitive interface, and the preview of the message shown on a phone rather than just in text format is so much fun! We switched from another platform and wish we didn't wait so long. Best out there - and now with the best pricing by far!"
I love PostScript. I use it on both of our stores. The interface is perfect. Shannon is so helpful and very patient. I really appreciate the fantastic service always.
Postscript is a fantastic app that easily allowed us to integrate text marketing to our business and we have seen a huge ROI. The interface is user-friendly and easy to use and the support throughout set up and after has been stellar. They are quick to answer questions and help you make the most of your plan.
"Great interface and features. You definitely need to be using SMS/MMS, otherwise you're leaving money on the table."
"Great interface, solid support, great products. I do wish they had more products focused on men but otherwise I have zero complaints."
Easy interface.  Very quick to initiate the task. Like it!
"Hands down the BEST sms app out there. I've used several others and only postscript ensures your legally compliant, has an easy to use interface and integrates with all the top apps! I've moved 8 other brands into postscript and its been more than worth it!"
"very beautiful user interface. Before PostScript I tried three other services and they were all clunky - I also had to ""rent"" a phone number that's 10 digits long (not user friendly looking for my customers). Postscript allows me to send messages with a short code, I can create keyword triggers and a host of other automations that help my life a lot easier. The integration with shopify and klaviyo is a plus - it was very seamless, and a lot less connecting stuff together on my part (I had to use Zapier to connect the pieces together alot with other interfaces that does not integrate directly). Just very glad that this service integrates directly with two platforms I use most frequently - Shopify and Klaviyo. Customer service also awesome (even on a Sunday afternoon) so that was a nice surprise!!"
Perhaps not the most intuitive or modern user interface but does the job. Good for quickly editing sales prices.
"I love postscript! We've tried 2 other sms apss and postcript blows them out of the water! Very easy to use, great interface, amazing support that gets back to me quickly. By far the best sms app out there for shopify stores and ecommerce in general. We love this app at goPure!"
"Installing this today moving over from another text app competitor. Aside from Sean being an awesome rep that quickly organized a plan overnight and setup a great demo walk through, the functionality capabilities from this platform blows the app that we were paying more for out of the water. They have a lot of segmentation that is closer to email capabilities, their own popup instead of having to use an outside popup, and better text technology from a user experience from what I can tell. It looks like they've thought through the text experience much more than others, and they even have an integration with ReCharge already! Really excited to see the performance of this for our brands.
- Dan"
"Sean and the team over at postscript really go ABOVE and BEYOND when it comes to customer service. Aside from the fact that the user interface in and of itself is the most well designed and user friendly SMS platform on the market, the team at postscript is seriously guaranteed to solve any problem that you may have. If you've thought about dabbling in SMS/MMS marketing, this is where you want to be. Postscript will be their to help and guide you from start to finish. Thanks again guys."
"Really i love fera application , their admin interface looking awesome and the have excellent report with fully details. Highly recommend fera for high conversion rate."
Nice clean interface. Looks great on my shop page. Easy to use
O aplicativo parece ser muito interessante. Uma interface simples de usar e de fácil aprendizado. Espero usá-lo bem.
I used this app just recently. installed easily and nice user interfaces. looking forward to test it
I’ve just installed the app and it looks great so far. It installed easily and has a great user interface. I’m looking forward to giving it a test-drive!
The interface for this app is poorly designed and not easy for clients to work with. I've also had issues with being billed twice for one subscription and haven't received any answers from their support team to remedy the situation. Buyer beware -- there are plenty of review apps out there that function better than this one and offer MUCH better support & billing practices.
"Very easy to install, use, and great support! The interface is simple, and the integration works very well."
"Good for social proof pop ups, nice interface .)"
An incredibly useful tool in presenting the streamlined user experience you're looking for! I highly recommend it!!
"I haven't published my referral program yet, but I can say the user interface is easy to use. Also, Referral Candy has a great, very efficient, reactive and friendly user support! Thanks!"
"Nice app, user interface is easy to understand. Thanks! I will recommend this for beginner"
Very user-friendly interface. Simple to set up and get going while still deep enough to provide customizable options. Lorraine was super helpful and helped me figure out a way to do what I needed. Highly recommend if considering and it fits your needs.
"So far so good - great app, easy to install and very user-friendly interface."
"We've been using Yotpo now for around 2 years, and absolutely love it. The interface is easy to use, the support is excellent, and our customers respond really well to it. 
Thanks team yotpo!"
"Simple, easy to set up, automated interface. Do not hesitate, I am going to start working on my customer conversion rates by using Fera."
"just started using this app! haven't had time to test it but, the user interface is wonderful, and easy to use"
"Brilliant app, which recently got even better. The interface is clean. The process of creating forms is very efficient, and the amount of features provided is excellent. The generated forms render well on all platforms, incl. smart phones. Users that run multiple web sites will appreciate the export/import feature, and we love the ability to create conditional hidden fields, that even can be used to send the form contents to different email addresses, depending on selections made on the form.
You get all that - and excellent customer service - for free!
5 Stars - Brilliant app."
"Very simple to use, fully customizable, intuitive user interface...and free !
Glad to have found this app !"
Excelente aplicativo. Excelente interface. Fácil de usar e o suporte é expecional. Atendimento na hora e com toda a atenção merecida. Nota 100%.
"Easy interface, reasonable customisability, all around good app."
User-friendly interface with the most genuine application!
"Very easy to use with the interface, a must have. I'm not big on coding however this was so simple that I was able to have my form created and on our site in less than 10 min.."
"Easy to use interface and lots of options, just what we needed to manage warranty support requests for our customers. Thanks!"
"I need to duplicate a from. But I cannot see the ""duplicate"" action in the form list interface. Is it possible to duplicate a select form? If not, can you add this action please?"
"There is no chat support, the interface is really unfriendly, i can;t figure out how to change my email message to customers from the panel.  This is a great app for what it does but it is very hard to use for some one like me who is a beginner."
Reviews and Q&A are ok but you can get the same for MUCH cheaper. UGC does not have an easy to use interface...much better off with Foursixty for Shoppable Instagram. Reps take weeks to get assistance
"Easy to use! Even though a little confusing at first! Very friendly interface! It serves the purposes of such app ideally! One wish only - maybe adding classic Fonts as - Times New Roman and Arial. Would be wonderful if two bars can be run simultaneously targeting two different countries! For example - Free Shipping to all orders in the USA - targeting only USA visitors and let's say Free Shipping to all orders over 1000.00 - ran for all visitors from Canada
Other than that - GREAT JOB!"
"App is limiting, and interface is complicated. Their support team is non-existent. Avoid at all costs, it'll take even more time when you have to switch to a different review app like me."
"I really like this app, especially to compare prices - easy to use the interface and helps with shipping solutions."
"Derek in support was really helpful in walking us through the program. We use our referral program selectively which makes it manageable. Easy to use interface, and less time consuming than other referral platforms we have tried."
Great App. works perfect for our website. Helps conversions rates. Would recommend this to any dropshipping or E-commerence store.  Love the interface and how it easy it is to use
"Clean and simple interface, and quick to setup.  Seeing incremental revenue within month of implementing. Customer support (Derek) had some useful tips too."
"I have not tried the conversion boost of this app yet, but configuring it was super easy and it's interface is great looking. Hoping to see some results!"
"I tried literally every subscription app on Shopify that is available in the app store and found out that Referral Candy was the best of all. Mainly because they have a clean and easy interface and is fully translatable in Dutch. Apart from this, support (in my case Derek) helped me out fast where needed. Thanks for this Derek!"
"De momento no pongo 5 estrellas porque acabo de empezar y quiero ver cómo funciona. A Antonio si que le pongo 5 estrellas, que ha sido muy atento y cordial. La aplicación tiene buena conectividad y la interface es bastante intuitiva."
"Very good app. The quick buy button started generating revenue almost immediately.  I had a couple issues with the app interface overlapping some other sections of my store and Adi helped me in a quick and efficient manner - and when I say quick I mean getting a response in 30 minutes. Pretty good!
I totally recommend this app because of both its functionalities and amazing support."
"I agree with the other negative reviews popping up. I'm leaving 3 stars just to say thanks for the while we have the free plan, but no more.
We have used the free version of Yotpo with great success but as a growing e-commerce store the added functionalities are a must. The Starter plan - $25 /month only gives you incremental features, then it goes to the Pro plan $399, Powerhouse plan $699/ month, an extremely steep and unrealistic increase in prices. Ideally we would of loved the Pro plan functionalities but weighing the cost benefits, we've decided against it which is a shame.
We're now using Judge.me, although the interface is not as sophisticated as Yotpo, they provide most of the functionalities we were looking for, amazing support, and they are constantly adding new functionalities listing to user feedback. That's how a app is supposed to be. The price point - $15/month is no where near what Yotpo asks for."
"Very happy with app.
Tested site speed on multiple pages before and after installing and setting up the app, no loss of page speed.
Facebook pixel etc recognises add to cart clicks.
I'm UK based and use a BAG icon rather than a cart icon, emailed support on a Sunday, they responded and by Monday morning the cart icon had been changed to reflect my existing Bag icon, great support.
Once installed the interface is very easy to navigate and set up with step by step instructions, including how images showing you exactly where to find action/event data in google analytics.
tested on multiple devices, operating systems and browsers and works as expected across the board. Highly recommended."
"nouvelle application installée sur ma boutique. les tarifs ont l'air corrects, l'interface claire et intuitive. Synchronisation avec Shopify qui fait gagner du temps."
"This is probably one of the best goddamn apps I've ever seen. It's already about to make me some money and it's such a clean interface, JAM PACKED with features! I love this app."
Awesome! Amazingly clean interface. Exactly what we were looking for to give our customers the ability to check up on their orders!
"The App is SUPER, works damn good and you won't see any app like this the interface it provides to customers and most IMPORTANT the customer support is amazing(very quick)."
"So far so good! 
I'm loving the interface of this software and am excited to see the results it brings!"
"Great review app. The interface is quite nice as you can customize everything you need to from the dashboard alone. Support was fast and quick and the integration with the Shopify platform is a lot cleaner than some of the other apps I've used. 
Bottom line, its the best review app on Shopify at the moment by far."
very pleased with the support we received when installing the app. It's been working smoothly since and we particularly enjoy the option to choose from multiple shipping companies through one interface. can only recommend.
i havnt had the chance to really try this out but the interface is friendly and it seems promising
"App works great with a nice back-end interface and great display on site. App is also NOT inside an i-frame, which I think is great :) Pricing for premium seems reasonable."
Amazingly surprised at the interface and ease of use platform!
"Easy integration, great customer service, interface is very simple. Love the app!"
"ReferralCandy is the perfect reward.referral interface to compliment Shopify and easy to use if all your business is run through Shopify.  However, if you business resides on multiple platforms, then fortunately ReferralCandy has APIs that you can interface with.  The APIs are well documented for the responses but a little weak on what is expected in terms of requests, but the good news is they have a great support team that is willing to help and responds within the day."
Great solution for a better user experience and increasing your sales!
"Turned it on and immediately got great response from our past customers, so the email interface must be just as simple to use as the back-end app.  Unobtrusive, quick to load, can put it where you want it - no complaints here!"
Interface is very easy to understand and follow. Support and Service are great!
Yotpo is amazing. Great user interface and perfect integration on my website. I highly recommend this app! Have not yet tried the coupon and seo tricks but will be sure to get around to that soon.
"Great work Team 
Really simplifies the end user experience in a good way."
"Hands down, this is a MUST HAVE APP for any store owner, it truly is excellent and had benefited my User Experience and my business for sure.  First of all, their Mail After Purchase feature gives me a great way to stay in touch with my customers as they are taking their monthly bottle of Liquid Vitamins.  Yes we are asking for their Review, but at the same time it gives me a chance to share some information with them and add value to their experience with or product.
The Installation was very easy, and their customization is also very good and allows you to match the look and feel of your site.
Lastly, I have interacted several times with one of their folks named Dannie, and she has been fantastic to work with, as was Dave early on.  The only thing I think that can be better is to set up some better data analysis and tracking, so that when you receive data from various things, you can drill down and see everything.  
Overall though, EXCELLENT APP, I highly recommend this.
Best,

Excellent way to keep track of orders with customers and avoid huge headache for employees or yourself. Highly reccomended for any store owner and the interface is beautiful!
"Great interface, more tools than I imagined and the email function is priceless! We were able to grab over 100 reviews in a week in response to the email requests. Love it!"
Simply awesome.  Love the customization abilities and easy to use interface.  If you are thinking about installing this just go for it.  I did it with little experience and it turned out great.  Slap that bad boy right near your add to cart button and start converting hesitant buyers with this awesome review app!
Excellent app to improve the user experience on any Shopify theme that doesn't have a quick view option. Top notch customer support from the team at secomapp. Highly recommended.
"I find this app to be just what the doctor ordered.   Very easy install.  Polite interface for customizing. Great options for that customization, and the variable ability to drop this into any area I like within my theme is great.
Traffic is up, conversations are being had and it has spawned something I didn't consider happening; reviewers are also visiting our blogs and commenting/sharing those.  Bounce rate is down, and time per page is up.  Fantastic.  Highly recommend."
"Easy to install, very user-friendly interface and really quick and good support."
"This is a great app. and delivers a great user experience for customers looking to track their order.  Installation is simple, the app. perfectly inherited the styles of our website, and it's a fast, intuitive user experience for customers to check the status of their order.
If you're looking for a branded order tracking experience served to users right on your site, Tracktor is a good bet.  It was the best of every service we tested.

"Fantastic app, easy setup, gorgeous interface! Staff is very engaging."
seamless installation and great interface. i tried quite a few rating widgets and this is the best!
"I installed quick view on my website and I am happy with the user-interface and ease of installation. I would like the option to change the standard ""quick view"" button to an image however beyond that I am happy with the app. I recommend it for any shopify store. Great work Secomapp"
"Simple install... online in minutes
Very clean interface, easy... great app for any site
No features though... hope they can add more layouts, and ability to change some graphics etc in the future, but its pretty clean
A huge wish to have would somehow be ability to add custom order status prior to the shipping...   so someone could see the entire process for those of us that assemble products."
"This app is amazing for being free, I just didn't appreciate the headache it gave me while I was trying to figure out how to use it. I didn't expect it to e-mail every customer who has ever bought items from us ever, I thought that was a little ridiculous. I didn't even know this app was going to e-mail customers, or send me over 100 e-mails in 2 days. The app is very vague on explaining how it works until things happen, like posting on our Facebook Page and the large widget at the bottom of product pages. I am also disappointed on how I can't easily find out enough information about a customer to contact them if they have a question. The interface has some glitches. Like the navigation buttons magically disappear when I am looking at the list or reviews if I go to publish or unpublish a review."
"Been using Zoorix for a few months now and while the interface isn't fancy it's easy to use, stable, and allows us to sell bundles effortlessly. Support is prompt and honest and love that they don't pretend to be something they are not. Would recomend."
"It's my first time using this app, so it's still in the process of getting more know details about it. But overall it's good user experience"
"This is a must have for any ecommerce site. It is very straightforward, easy to install even for the little to no-tech shop owners (like myself). It's interface is very easy to navigate and understand. And the email after purchase feature not only gets a lot of people to review products when they might normally not, it also acts as a reminder about your store. Very well done folks at Yotpo! Thanks!"
"Yotpo is a review magnet!  It is unbelievable the % of customers that turn into reviewers.  They have a great interface that directly emails your customers and easily allows them to publish reviews without leaving email.
Also they keep coming out with new features, and its even easier to make it look integrated with your site.
Very well done and you can't beat the price!"
"This app is ok if you use in consecutively / It just did not fit my theme! the interface is not up to date to me and it made my site look cheesy. It also stalled each time i try to view the dash board. I just mainly use it to track traffic. If I could give 2 1/2 I would but you can't do half stars. This is just my person opinion. I suggest trying out the app and make a judgement for yourself. Everyone's experience is their own. What doesn't work for me may work for you.
Good Luck on Your Shopify Journey!"
Great interface with heaps of options! Looks slick on the site too...
"I love this app. Easy to use. Interface is smooth, sleek. It's not difficult to navigate at all. Would recommend."
"Great app, it will be 5 stars if the template editor can be done through graphical interface instead html but it's FREE and works very well, therefore 100% recommended"
Great tool to add legitimacy to your website. Easy to use for the most part. I bet the interface and usability well get better over time.
"Very good app. Love it
Easy to use, friendly interface, fast sync.
I would recommend this app for any shopify store"
Great app with simple interface. would recommend it for starters like me ;)
easy to set up and clean interface! good customization options also
This app provides a great seamless interface to print out bulk orders on demand. Great app. Thanks so much.
"Judge.me is an awesome app and does absolutely everything we need it to. The interface is super easy to use, and the free app includes all of the essentials which we really appreciate. The customer service team are always very helpful and responsive, and were able to install the widget for us within 10 minutes. Highly recommend!"
"This app is very cool, very helpful.
The interface is clean, un-congested, it does exactly what it is supposed to and it does it with style.
Stephen over at customer support is very helpful and courteous.
Also, this awesome app is FREE.
Guys, thanks for making this and for keeping it free, keep up the good work."
"Super easy to use, very nice interface, super quick (and definitely super helpful) customer service. A feature I needed wasn't available so I reached out through the instant chat box in the app. Within a few days, I was notified personally to let me know the feature's been added. Best part of it is that you get so much value and all for FREE!"
"Serious hidden gem right here, folks. Rockstar customer service and a user-friendly interface make this the kind of app dreams are made of, not to mention it's actually affordable. (huge bonus because those app fees start to add up!)"
"Intuitive interface, great support, and more fully featured than other form apps for Shopify."
"Great, simple review app. Fairly easy to use, although a slightly cluttered interface on the back end. That said, any questions have been responded to and actioned straight away!"
"Great app. Does what it says. But also have to give some props to the technical support. We had a customization request, and they jumped in and filled it quickly and courteously. And it has made a difference in our user experience. Nice work!
— Came back to update. The team continues to help us with many customizations. Always very attentive. GREAT customer service."
"Great functionality, easy to use interface, very quick customer service, and most importantly, extremley functional. Keep up the good work!"
This is a very solid free announcement bar app that does the job perfectly. The interface is simple to use and the bar designs are nice.
Interface isn't very user friendly. Don't see much utility with this app. Do not recommend!
Does what it says on the tin! The interface to set up the banners couldn't be simpler if you tried. Great app!
"Responsive customer service, easy interface, great app"
Quick Announcement Bar has a simple interface that is easy to use.  The free version does exactly what I need it to - put an announcement-type bar at the top of my website that can link wherever I need it to.
"Great app. 
As a developer, I was surprised that this app requires zero code changes; it's literally 'plug n play'.
The app interface offers a few simple, easy-to-use customisation options, such as custom CSS and an adjustment bar to manipulate the size of the magnified area."
"I've only just started to use this app so the 3 stars are for set-up, interface and support so far all of which have been excellent.  if it delivers as it promises to deliver, I'll come back and give it 5 stars.  
The interface is really user friendly and very easy to set up and get started which means a huge amount to me as am not a techy but need to trade my store.  Great support on hand and I already have 2 affiliates so the signs are good so far."
"Lovely, the service was instant, no wait for email replies or have to fill out any contact forms. Customer service is 5 star and appreciated the live chat interface. 
Knowing in the future my worries will be taken care of immediately.
Highly recommended."
"Simple and Easy, this is how all apps should, I would like to see a better interface but hey it's free :p"
"Ok got them installed.  Forget all other competition for affiliates. Absolutely.  Only have 2 issues, the amount of unique visitors is low for what your paying.  Should definetly get more.  I could see having a cap on the affiliates a month but views?  Ehh Ill take the good with the bad on that one, chalk it up.
Next issue is kind of big, and confusing! I cant get it set up where when they refer someone then they get 1% of the person that they refer (another affiliate) sales.  Other than that, the interface is beautiful.  Their support is quick to respond.  Just please fix those issues.
Added note: Please add other social media, tumblr"
"Adam Jacobs just answered 25 questions for me in a chat window and Jennifer Goodman yesterday~! I'm loving the support for LeadDyno. I've been looking for a way to start an affiliate program for 10 years or more. LeadDyno is super easy to set up with seemingly unlimited nuances to be tweaked. It is exactly what I was looking for. It is similar to WordPress in the way it is highly customizable, yet ready to go right out of the gate with very minimal effort.
I signed up a test account to see what it looks like and what the user experience is for the affiliate and it is super easy to sign up. It doesn't ask for address or phone number which is GREAT. The easier to sign up, the more people we will have selling for us. 
I only set this up about 3 days ago, so the fact that I feel like I can already review it is telling~! I am just having trouble getting Etsy hooked up, but expect that will be fixed soon and am thrilled that it is an option as my top marketer tends to refer Etsy most."
"Update: January 15, 2017, many months after the initial review, still happy! :)
********************************************************************************
I don't know what to say other than the fact that I've reviewed dozens of affiliate softwares/apps thru the years and LeadDyno is the one I chose! I don't know of any other competitor out there that offers so much for so little.
I particularly love the fact that they are one-click INTEGRATED with both Shopify and Coinbase! If you know anything about the online world, API integration with other apps is really the name of the game today in terms of having a robust and powerful website. 
I love the fact that with 1-click I can also pay affiliates via BITCOIN all over the world (as long as they have an email address)! You can also pay them via PayPal.
And I'm not talking about integrations in THEORY. I'm talking about integrations that were 1-click and ACTUALLY WORK! 1-click, boom, it started WORKING and COMMUNICATING back and forth with my Shopify store. 1-click, boom, it started WORKING and COMMUNICATING with COINBASE and I started ACTUALLY PAYING affiliates with Bitcoin!!! :)
The new kewl colored graphical interface they just rolled out after months of beta testing rocks as well! They have a LOT of analytics and they are great, it tells you a LOT about the nature of the traffic you're generating!
If I find a better one, I'll let you know, but at least for now, it's LEADDYNO!
Adam, Manager of Customer Support, has always been very helpful and great as well. :)
By the way, 2 that I tried and ditched before settling in with LD was Omnistar and Post Affiliate Pro, those two just didn't ""integrate"" with me!
As you can see, most of the reviews here are extremely positive with just a few bad ones sprinkled in to the mix. I would say that the difference between users is that the software does work extremely well, but as with all good softwares, there is a LEARNING CURVE involved. The great reviews are coming from the technically talented/patient ones whereas the the few bad reviews are coming from people not so technically talented/patient. I am a layperson when it comes to technical things and I had a little bit of a hard time at the beginning, not too much, but a little, but I stayed patient and got a handle on everything and generally found that the software was great and worked pretty much flawlessly, I just had to get used to it and understand it and that takes time. But you don't have to be a rocket scientist. Just calm, patient and diligent. Stay calm and patient and Adam and the crew will work with you and get you on track, for sure. :)
We have been with them for about 20 months now and plan on staying awhile. :)
Oh, one last thing, I don't know of ANY other affiliate software in the WORLD that integrates with Coinbase 1-click or any clicks and allows you to pay affiliates worldwide with email addresses with Bitcoin! I was probably one of if not the major customer that was pushing for this when they just barely had it on the drawing board and they got 'er done probably within a month or three of me signing up! I was so happy! :)

"Brilliant app, even better support team! Love how the app is simple to use and has a clean interface"
"I'll caveat this with saying we haven't pushed much in the way of getting our affiliates to market us yet (still recruiting them), but we have tested this extensively and are in the beginning stages of using it.
LeadDyno does the job  and does it well and it's the ONLY app on the Shopify app store where the PRICING STRUCTURE ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE. The only minor complaint is some parts of the dashboard and of their website are overly wordy and could be trimmed down.
Unless you're selling stupidly high margin products or you're giving your affiliates peanuts, every other piece of affiliate software out there is far too expensive. They make them look cheaper by having lower prices (and deceiving price structures), but in relation to the incremental profit they can drive this is the only app where we could achieve a positive ROI. 
I say it's not perfect not because there's anything wrong (it does everything it's supposed to do), but only because there are a couple tiny, unpolished aspects. These things are so small it's probably not even worth the providers fixing them given. Basically my only beef is that their site and dashboard are a bit wordy and have a few too many options that, in the beginning, are not entirely obvious. 
Once you get used to the interface though it's everything you need.
That and Brett and Adam are both super-responsive and helpful from a support perspective.
Don't bother with any other affiliate app because these guys have it figured out."
"I installed the LeadDyno app into my shopify admin and at first I was having some issues when testing whether the affiliate links were tracking throughout the checkout process.  They were not, so I contacted their customer service via chat on their website which was super simple and they started a tech support ticket for me.  I went back and forth with tech support to make sure I had things setup properly and eventually they found out the issue was an incompatibility with the Ajaxify Cart plugin that was on my shopify theme.  I just had to uncheck the enable option for Ajaxify Cart and the problem was gone.  They extended my free trial period since it took a little longer than expected to get the software up and running properly.  
I like that LeadDyno lets me setup item specific commissions and the whole tracking system, payments and dashboard interface seem very top notch so far."
"Phenomenal. I was searching and searching for a good variant app, and this is the ONE. Let me walk you through what makes it so good:
1. Quick, easy setup. If you’re not confident with coding the expert team has it up and running within a couple of hours.
2. Easy to use. Out of the several I have tested this has the most straightforward interface. It had every function I wanted from swatches to pricing per variant. 
3. Design integration - if you have a clue about CSS it’s fairly easy to amend to make it look the same. If, like me, you’re a bit of a novice, they have a cracking team who’s reply rate is swift. They had my design exactly how I wanted it within 1 email! 
All in all a great app, and a massive shout out to Steven. Been incredibly helpful from the outset and an asset to their team."
"Great and easy interface and an amazing support team. I needed help with the placement of the bar, and their team helped get what we wanted."
"We performed a fair bit of research to determine what the most cost effective and feature rich affiliate management software was that easily integrated with Shopify, and LeadDyno came out ahead by a large margin. 
In addition to the well designed and easy to use interface throughout all of the screens, the real power behind LeadDyno is that it not only allows for all the standard affiliate management functions like managing affiliates, payment management, commission, customizable affiliate sign-up page, it also allows for full lead pipeline tracking meaning that your affiliates can be rewarded for not only sales, but visits, leads and eventual purchases. 
Additionally we chose LeadDyno because it seems to come from a pedigree of people that really know their way around the online retail environment as well as what makes affiliate programs such a powerful marketing tool. Comparing it to other available Shopify affiliate apps, LeadDyno also stood out because of the additional bells and whistles such as campaign tracking, lead capture forms and affiliate sign-up forms you can embed anywhere."
"OK...so you may appreciate this perspective coming from a non-programer. I have used 1ShoppingCart for nearly 10 years but with this new venture decided to move on. A HUGE part of our business success is the ability to operate a reliable and easy to use affiliate program. I tried 2 other affiliate programs from the Shopify app store and after spending about 3 hours setting up each, I gave up on each. Fortunately I persevered and tried one more, the last one that seemed like a viable option-LeadDyno. After having experienced the two other affiliate interfaces and feeling dread in trying to figure it all out, coming to LeadDyno was a totally different experience. Their step by step instructions are excellent (except for one aspect of the tracking documentation that needed to be inserted into my WordPress site-but within minutes of chatting with customer service online it was all totally explained and set up), their sign up process from an affiliate stand point is super easy and clear, the tracking interface is great. One of the other competitors has GREAT customer service too but it felt like the site was kind of new and there weren't a lot of references for it. The other company I just never heard back from at all. So, from a non-programmer perspective, I would totally recommend this app. At least from an initial set up perspective."
"This is an excellent app and wonderful team that is behind the service. they go above and beyond to help their customers to receive the best experience. the installation went very easy, I enjoyed making first banner: it is very intuitive interface to work with. they even have holiday banners!  the use of the timer instantly improved my sales.  recommend this app to all store owners."
"My store requires a lot of variants and this app is perfect for that. From a shopper standpoint, the user experience using the variants is clean, easy, and organized. The customer service is also amazing! Steven was so prompt and thorough in his responses and solved all my problems and did the coding for me. Amazing product!"
"Fantastic support - I couldn't find where to paste in the code so I emailed them and within 24 hours their team fixed my problem. The review interface blends in with my template well and is easy to use, and the backend allows me to verify the reviews before publishing. I wanted an app that allowed customers to upload photos and this provides that feature. Thanks!"
"User friendly, simple interface, able to implement and put to use very quickly.  I had a few questions and customer care was quick to respond and accommodate, same day.  I'm a happy customer!"
"Pinterest has been the easiest and most productive channel for us. Set up has been intuitive and easy. The layout and user interface are great. Google was a disaster on multiple occasions, so I was very pleasantly surprised at the ease. The analytics and integrations are solid and useful. good all around."
Pinterest helps me share our products through our images easily. I also think the interface is good for users to have a clear idea of our identity and style.
The app did exactly what it said it would with a clean and easy to understand interface. Looks great and would definitely recommend.
This is an amazing app and even more amazing is Kim´s support. Very happy to be a user of it for a long time and now even happier with the new and very easy interface! I surely recomend it! A must have app if you deal with personalized items! Thanks so much! ;-)
Super easy interface to use. I could twelve how simple it was to get added to my store. So many choices as part of the Basic (free) package too!
"Amazing customer service, awesome app, would 100% recommend! Love their interface, and they helped me change some fonts & colors within 2 minutes :)"
"Judge.me is an awesome product review app! Seamless customer experience, great interface and admin dashboard and their support team is fast and helpful!"
This a very effective app. It is easy to use and understand. The interface for making bars is really intuitive.
"Super easy to install and use, the interface is very user-friendly. If I need anything more advanced, the Support team is really responsive too!"
"The app has a clean and functional interface with immense customization. It also automatically translates into many languages, which has been a huge help for my store. The customer service is also outstanding, they did custom work on the layout of the widgets for free and literally in minutes. Shout out to Cesar and Abdessadek! Thank you, guys!"
"Functional, but clunky.
The interface doesn't allow reordering options within a customization, so if you want to reorder or add an option anywhere but the bottom of the list, you have to delete your old options and retype them. Did your list include a typo? No problem - just delete everything after the typo and retype it all. For an app that supposedly offers unlimited customizations and options, this is an unforgivable oversight.
The interface doesn't allow a default that isn't the top field, so mid-range choices can never be the default without being out of order.
As of Feb 2014, the interface has an annoying bug that both displays the customization order in the control panel out-of-order from the actual final display and moves the wrong selections when you do move them. As a result, I'm unable to get my first customization to the top. For such a bare bones interface, I'd have expected this bug to never escape testing.
The customizer only allows selections in a long list - there's no ability to group customizations under headlines, include explanatory information between each option, or insert photos. 
The interface doesn't distinguish between unmodified customizations and those you haven't saved yet, so you have to either keep track of what you've changed or re-save everything. 
Product Customizer works... sorta."
"To cut a long story short this app is excellent, does exactly what it says it will do, has a very easy user interface and as far as inserting code into one's template (for installation) goes this app is up there with the easiest. Very happy.
We experienced a slight problem when which was no fault of the developer. We redesigned our website and thus had a complete overhaul of our templates. Nonetheless the developers rectified our coding headache in a short space of time which is incredibly impressive. 
$4 a month isn't a lot to pay each month but for a simple app it is maybe a shade excessive. What if you're in business for 10 years? That's a lot of $$$ over a long period. Having said that, if your store requires tons of product customisation then wow, it's cheap. Personally, I think the app should be a one time fee kind of thing but that's just our thoughts. 
Can't knock this app as it does what it advertises. I would like to see some more ideas added to this app to justify the monthly price tag."
Product Customizer works great! The drop down menus are super easy to create and the interface is easy to use! I highly recommend the app!
The Product Customizer App is amazing! Without the app I would not be able to run my store with the effective ease that the app provides. The interface is very easy to use and adding multiple items was not a problem. I would HIGHLY recommend this app to anybody who is in need of a multiple option ordering system. LOVE IT!
"Simple interface. Easy to set up. Outstanding customer service. 
When I commented to the developer that the app didn't look quite as good as I'd hoped on my site, I was presented with a great solution within hours. 
Could not rate highly enough."
"Absolutely love the interface and features. After searching for a bundle app for so long we finally found Vitals! Now we can remove the other apps we have for reviews, and only use this one. The customer service was beyond incredible too. I am impressed."
"This app was easy to install, understand, and has a very intuitive interface that is uncomplicated to figure out. The customer service was prompt and very friendly. I recommend this product!"
"What a fantastic app! I would seriously urge anyone selling personalized products to get it at once! 
Great interface, helpful and friendly support and simple to install the little bit of code needed (which is made even easier with the detailed tutorial vids).
Can not recommend this app enough!"
Amazing support and great interface! I love the new layout as its much easier to interact with than previous
This App is a lifesaver. I was suprised that Shopify did not already come with a way to do this and breathed a sigh of relief when i found this app (after spending days setting up my shop!). The support is top notch. My support emails were answers in what seemed like mere minutes. the interface is easy to use and it does exactly what it says it does. Fabulous app - I reccomend it.
"really good app - easily the best and most valuable one i have installed. it actually saves a lot of money - any shop where each product has a few variations, e.g. 3 colours and 3 sizes, will very quickly eat up all the available SKUs in their shopify plan, forcing them to upgrade and pay higher monthly bills. this app eliminates the need to do that, while still allowing the use of shopify variants (useful for when the variant price changes) simultaneously.
the interface is very simple, and i flew through adding many variants to all of my (350+) products.
on top of all this, the customer support is excellent. denis responded to my email quickly, and was very helpful. he even implemented a suggestion to the code within a couple of hours! you don't get that with most apps.
so thanks for the great app! i would really recommend it. you can see it in use on my site:
http://www.spoiltpets.com"
"Simple d'utilisation, avec interface traduite en français et un tchat instantané avec le STAFF en cas de problème. PARFAIT."
Set up was easy and self explanatory. The user interface was simple. I highly recommend using this app.
"Great app, very easy to use interface making installation easy. Functions well on the website. Highly recommend it."
"In Stock Alerts is a brilliant app that allows you to update customers who are interested in a specific product. It's a great sales tool that allows you to maximise revenue by following up on 'warm' customers. Easy to deploy, with a simple and understand interface, it's a great addition to our Shopify store.
Swym's customer support is exceptional and responsive, so you can deploy the app with the confidence that you won't be left scratching your head if you do encounter any integration challenges."
"Easy to navigate interface and sync from previous mail provider, great tools and assistance when needed. A happy change from mailchimp."
So far very easy to work with. Straight forward integration from Mail chimp and easy to navigate interface. It exactly what I was looking for in a email marketing app.
I used this app to help me do a webpage. I really like how it does. It would be nice if it did interface better.
"I finally started using Omnisend on my shop and I love the overall user experience, especially the editor."
"Templates are very nice and the user interface is similar to mailchimp, only better in my opinion. I am happy with my first newsletter."
"Amazing app! I've been using it for almost 2 months now and the assisted conversions have been more than paying for the app itself, definitely worth every penny! There are a lot of useful apps bundled together in one app, and you are actually getting great value as similar apps go for 5-10 dollars each at least per month elsewhere. Also when all the apps are displayed in one interface, it allows for easier app management/app support, and there are fewer issues with clashing apps as you are going with one developer (especially when building bundles and upsells). Great work guys! One thing I would love to see in the future would be a mass sale editor app (Shopify only display automatic storewide sales in Cart, for storewide sale to show up on product pages, you would have to edit every product's compared at price which is impossible when you have a large inventory. It would be wonderful if Vital could add an app where it would display storewide sales on product pages (Currently using an app called Sale & Discount Manager for this function, would be amazing to see this in VITALS so I don't have to pay for another app)."
"Love, love, love this app! It makes marketing campaigns a breeze. My email list grows daily. It has an intuitive interface that's easy to use, and automated workflows that save me oodles of time."
A great solution for the occasional notifications we need to place on our website throughout the year. Lots of customization features and an easy to use interface. Thank you for making a simple and concise bar for Shopify.
Awesome! This app is just powerful! You can have multifunctions in one go. I highly recommend this app to people that are looking forward to bringing a friendly user experience to the customers and subsequently increase sales!
"I've started using it now and everything has a perfectly arranged, user-friendly interface. I hope it gives good results. Also the support team are very friendly. Thank you to OmniSend Team for such a nice application."
"Easy to install and maintain and a easy-to-read interface
Looking forward to reach the targets i set"
I used the trial version of this app. I think they done a fantastic job at creating rules and interface/UI. However they didn't pay attention to how email system work. You will ruin your domain reputation if you use them as they source all emails from the same IP address (which means all your emails to customers will end up in JUNK folder). They have no solution for this and thus the whole concept behind email marketing/automation rules they have is useless for businesses.
I really like this app. The basic templates are flexible and customizable enough to give a pretty good user experience. It's not complicated to use and edit. I like that it can fade out and disappear when configured so. I believe it's given our website (pacificbling. com) a decent uplift. I would recommend others to use this.
"Easy integration. AC is a very powerful tool that takes a fair amount of time to set up properly.  
It works really well for B2C companies not so well for B2B, because of the way the contacts are organized. Interface is another area that could be improved.
Can get very pricey with the large number of contacts.
Still highly recommend the app because of its flexibility, stability and features."
"Fantastic app, really got a lot of good and useful features/functions in it that allow you to remove other apps and have one streamlined source. The interface of the app is super clear, they got tons of efficient tutorials and overall easy to use! Customer support is another outstanding part of the app. Never waited long and the guys working there certainly know what they doing and are superb. Lastly, they keep adding new features and actually listen to customer feedback on improvements and desired functions. Definitely recommend this, you wont regret signing up."
I have used many email marketing apps and this one has been the easiest to use. The interface is smooth and dynamic.
Great working interface with our Shopify store. The setup was easy and we were up and running within a few minutes.
Active Campaign boosted our sales dramatically. We were able to reach our customers really fast and their interface is super user friendly. Easy to operate and they have great features. We would recommend it to any store.
"The customer interface is not very intuitive so it's confusing to navigate and set things up. The customer service is very helpful and responsive though so that makes it better!
So glad to have a customizable review platform that sends of review requests!"
I am amazed at how easy and intuitive this interface is to use! Only wish I'd downloaded it earlier. Thank you QAB!
"Great App. Does exactly what we needed, and offers a very easy to update interface. Now we can communicate with our users about discounts/fulfillment news, etc. Highly Recommended."
I really enjoy having this app on my website as a notification tool for my customers when I need it. I wish the bar setup interface was a little more clean but other than that no real complaints.
"I've had Omnisend for almost a year now and for all the features that this app offers and how it is sales based; they simply can't be beat. The interface is clean and simple, the features are useful and plenty, support is attentive."
"I am amazed to get so much, even on the free plan - including amazing service. The user interface is not super polished but this app does so many things! I really like it."
"I love how easy it was to set up, the great interface made adding my store a easy process, I would recommend this."
I just started using the app so i can't tell how good it is but the interface looks good. About to set it up for my store.
"$29.99 per month for this app—are you serious?! That was my first thought when I saw the price tag. I am in the process of opening my online store and wanted features that would create a great user experience for my customers. I spent days and weeks looking for free plans that would match my needs but ultimately it hit me—there must be an app that combines all of these features, or at least, the majority of them. That’s when I found Vitals 40+ on the Shopify apps list and I was instantly skeptical of the 5 Star Reviews. I assumed they were fake reviews to boost the app installs. It was a good thing they offer a 30-day trial so I said why not test it for myself. The installation was flawless. I began going down the list of features available from the Vitals app and narrowed down the ones that I needed and started activating them. Aside from the features I was looking for they had features that I didn’t know I needed until I saw them. Each feature comes with a helpful tutorial video with explanations which I thought is super handy. The ultimate best feature of this app is not actually the app itself but the freaking amazing customer service team! I was stuck on setting up a feature and noticed a pop-up chat icon. I clicked on it thinking it would be an automated bot chat thing, but to my surprise, Reymond responded within seconds and offered assistance. My next thought was “this agent is probably just going to submit a support ticket on my behalf and someone will get back to me.” Wrong again! I told him what the issue was and what I wanted and he said he will look into it. Not even 5 minutes later, he replied with a screenshot of that changes made. I refreshed my store’s page and the changes were made. My jaws dropped in disbelief. I spent the next 3 to 4 hours chatting with Reymond to help me set up plenty of features from the Vitals app and each issue was resolved within minutes. I was disappointed to find that the chat box had disappeared when I returned the next day to continue with setting up the Vitals app. So, I used email to communicate any issues I had and the response was quick. Filip responded to my email with the solution to my problems within 5 to 10 minutes. Again, super impressed with the customer service and the speed. I spent the next 5 hours emailing Filip back and forth, implementing the features I wanted and the layout I wanted with no problems at all. $29.99 per month is super cheap when you consider all the tools and amazing customer service provided by just one app. One app means less loading time for your store and less complications with integrating several features from different apps. Why overwhelm yourself with several individual apps when you can do it with just one. Also, the price plan for each of those separate apps will probably cost more than $30 per month. The team has a roadmap of new features to be released and you can even recommend your desired features. So your monthly fee goes a long way and is definitely worth it. We did encounter an issue that needed to be escalated, but I am confident the team will be able to find a solution. Again, $29.99 per month for superior customer service, quick response times, and the 40+ features from one app is unbelievable. I pay my internet service provider way more and it takes hours spanning several days just to resolve a simple issue. Of course, everyone is in a different situation, but I highly recommend the Vitals 40+ app. Shout out to Reymond and Filip for all their help and phenomenal efforts in rolling out my desired features from the Vitals app in just a couple of days. When I went into this, I thought it would take me weeks of emailing support back and forth to achieve my desired outcome. It was a good thing I decided to give the app a chance. I am a satisfied user and I hope the team keeps up the good work and continues to release more features!"
Omar is the best! He has been helping me with technical issues with my interface. He is very kind and understanding with my requests. I gladly recommend Judge.me! Intuitive and user friendly
good interface and easy to use. i believe it can be a good place to advertise and hopefully can provide me some results
"I havent tried to much yet, but it looks good, was quick to setup, and an easy interface, i hope this will help things get easier"
"Excellent app and top-notch customer service! It's easy to use, has a clean interface, and integrates really well in my store."
"Simple and straight forward. Does exactly what's advertised, with an extremely simple to use interface.
Doesn't push you to upgrade, the free version has all the features needed for this app to be useful."
"I've tried a bunch of the other main email tools and this one is by far the best and easiest to use. The support is amazing as well, and the UI and interface is intuitive and modern. Being able to create popups takes out the need for a lot of other apps as well."
"This is honestly the best app AND customer service ever! I just started my free trial and I love how easy the interface is. Not to mention that all the questions I had were answered within minutes by Jed - they've given me the best customer service I've ever had on an app and helped me with everything that I needed help with.
I will definitely be keeping this app after the trial ends. It has so many apps integrated into it that I need to run my store. If I could give all the thumbs up in the world, I honestly would lol.
Thank you so much!!!!"
"This is only the second day I've installed VITALS. THIS IS AMAZING! Each app is so easy to enable and set up with a great user experience. I've deleted all other apps after I installed VITALS. Also, the support team is great, quick response, resolved my issues perfectly! Highly recommend."
"Omnisend is a very great app to have. Extremely simple, clean and support is great. There are many apps out there, if you are just getting started then we would recommend using Omnisend just for the easy to use interface. Thanks"
"This app is simply amazing! If I had to pay for each individual app I used separately, the cost would be enormous! And what I loved best was the lightning speed response of the support team! They sorted me out so fast and are very friendly communicators. These help improve user experience, and for these I give them a 6-star rating ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
"Amazing！There are so many features that I could use. I love the interface, its clean and functional. Also templates are easy to use and good looking!"
Ground breaking approach to user experience. Available plans make it very easy for newbies to get a headstart.
Moving away from Mailchimp and using Omnisend now. Love the interface and capabilites of this App
"The app does what it's supposed to do. The support is readily available and very great.
But, honestly, the user interface is VERY bad. One of the worst and most counter intuitive interfaces I have ever experienced.
Settings are scattered everywhere; even the wording of parameters is a mess.
To be honest, I wouldn't use it if I were to open anther store."
Excellent app so far. Has wonderful simple templates and an easy to use interface. Have no problems so far even though I just started using it.
Great interface and great that they have a very considerate free plan! love it
"Such a simple and clean interface. 
Great nomenclature, almost all labels are self-explanatory
Custom workflows are definitely great and much simpler than other apps :D"
"Omnisend's user interface and ease of use is why I choose it over Mailchimp and Constant Contact. We're currently using the free version, and it still does everything we need it to do (which is sending the occasional email about our newest ridiculous shirt design)."
"Just sent our first email campaign, so far so good. The design interface is easy to use, you just need to be careful with image sizes, as it doesn't care for images that are too large. We thought it created an attractive email in a very short amount of time."
"I am using this App for many outstanding features, their all in one solution has saved me a lot & VITALS has completely changed the overall look and user experience on my Store. The support team is not just perfect but they always go to their maximum to help me out and for their response time I would like to give them 5+++"
"Nice app! I recommend it.
very beautiful interface."
Great app and also their support team. Really appreciated. Just love to use it. the interface is so nice.
"easy to navigate and create custom emails and workflows, Great Interface!"
"Parfait ! L'interface est hyper simple, et très optimisé"
"I loved Gena's support, fast, helpful and very friendly!
As for the app, it is very good, easy to use interface and visually very similar to a normal e-commerce"
Beginner friendly interface! Can easily launch a campaign in less than an hour! I would highly recommend this app for any shopify store owner.
The experience has been so positive that I have signed up for a pro account with the yearly fee. I love the interface and how visual it is. By the way if you are in need of cot quilts make sure you check out my website! www.lalandnil.com
Great customer service when needing to trouble shoot. Fast response and friendly. Easy to use set-up interface too. I look forward to using this service
I used this to help create a marketing channel for by ebooks. It was easy to setup. I really liked how it interfaced with my shopify store.
"My theme has an announcement bar built in, but it's great to have this when I want to customize the look and feel (and placement) with an easy interface. Thanks for a great app!"
"I'm using the Free Version and it is a highly functional and respectable App in my opinion. It serves my needs well.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the user interface design could improve some. I wouldn't let a slightly less than perfect score detour anyone from considering Hextom's Banner App. It's a good App and I've been using it for months with no functional issues. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a solid Banner App, which I'm compelled to remind everyone, the basic version is generously offered for FREE."
"When you have troubles with Mailchimp, this is a great alternative, if not better! I like the interface, nice and streamlined."
I have installed Omnisend for a few days.  The interface is easy to use and I find it very handy to launch my email campaigns.  The support team is efficient and helpful. Highly recommended !
easy interface and does it's job perfectly.
Nice Service. Easy to use interface.
Simple to install and does what it says. We subscribed after we evolved past our existing review platform. We migrated specifically for its facebook and google interface and ability to manage international reviews (in language). Followed the instructions and what I was puzzling over for a week was handled in an afternoon.
"When importing subscribers, customers and contacts from my business who have actually signed up on the website or bought products, omnisend automatically sets around half of them as ""non-subscribed"" -  therefore half of my subscribers will never see any of the emails sent out. Not a very good system as there is no manual override or way for you to set them back to subscribed by yourself.
However, after this happening I have been in contact with customer support, who was very quick, friendly and helpful - who has reinstated my subscribers. Still -  this step should not really be necessary if the system did not have this strange issue.
Be very aware of this flaw in the app and that you will have to contact customer service and at their discretion have them set your subscribers from non subscribed back to the correct subscribed status.
Will be testing the app more to see if it fulfills our needs as an email marketing system after a rocky start to using it.
UPDATE : After having even more problems loading up lists which I have already paid to be cleaned, the system automatically stops campaigns from running. The support screenshot guides which show how to remove inactive emails are completely wrong and out of date as the company has updated their system but not the screenshots, so all fields are different and impossible to follow the guide. I have been sent this wrong guide now about 3 or 4 times by various support staff.
So far omisend, although has a fairly nice interface, is a complete headache and waste of time using in practice compared to other email marketing systems.
UPDATE : Omnisend after a year of me using it decided to increase the price to a ridiculous amount, maybe 10 times what i was paying, so i cancelled it. The app is nice idea but please not the severe flaws as above and now the stupid pricing makes it way overpriced and not a feasible option to use. Sort it out guys..."
"Prompt and quick response every time.
Very happy with the user experience.
Great customer service. Thank you"
"Have only just started but so far this looks to be exactly what I was after. Easy interface, plenty of options. Loving it so far!"
"One of the most important apps on my site. Also the one with the most flexibility, the most intuitive user interface, and with the most responsive service"
"excellent customer interface, works very effeciently...put it on automode and it does what its supposed to do...once you add this app, you will not look for an alternative.."
"You only need this one app for your Shopify store. Easy interface! Enable any app with one click. On top of it great Customer Support! 1- Increase my website load speed compared to other apps.
2- Improve customer experience of my website.
3- Highly recommend to everyone who wants to get more sales and higher conversion rates."
"•Must have apps for a webstore to save your time and enhance user experience
•Customer support is reliable and response within minutes"
I was satisfied with the service and it helped me get reviews from customers on my platform. I loved the interface and design. Thanks!
"Great interface, speedy support. Many thanks to Costin, Jed and Vladimir for quick replies and solutions!"
i really like how they guide me step by step! Thanks for the help i really apprecciate! now i can present a better interface for my users
"I built my first e-mail marketing campaign with Soundest, and it was relatively easy. The interface is easy to understand and the design themes are professional. I'm very pleased with the end result."
"This app is simply fantastic. The thing I love the most is the ability to optimize the site (conversion, speed, functionality, user experience) with a few button clicks. The session recorder functionality allowed me to understand the user behavior on my site. In addition to the solid app, their support team gets an A+ from me. They are simply amazing and very thoughtful and helpful."
"I found this app quite complicated to set up and already faced an obstacle when i was setting up my first feature, it didnt show up on my site.
you cant choose what what you want to show up with frequently bought together for instance if you bought a you want to show c and d but you dont get to choose A.
the upsell seems not not exist also, it just has a button to tick, what are you ticking to.
lots of the apps that are including in the 40 or so benefits are actually freebies that can be downloaded individually and will work alot better.
there interface is so primitive and doesnt have much versatility and quite surprised that app has the rating it has.
i would rather pay lot more for something that works seamless rather than face problems on the first one and you have 39 other issues to face."
User to use interface gets you creating without obstacles. Nice work.
Good interface. Just sent my first campaign and hoping for the best result.
"I'm still on the free trial but so far I LOVE LOVE LOVE the interface! Super easy to use and create personalized emails, newsletters and subscription boxes that go with your niche. Super excited to see more!"
"This is the first time I have ever left a review on a Shopify app and I have used several dozen of them. The user experience of this app is second to none and the free version is outstanding, the best app on Shopify by far."
"nice it's first time use but see lots of possibility in the future for fashion and furniture... good for marketing, nice visual interface and contents
thanks"
"I have used this to send out a couple emails by now, and I must say, it is very user friendly and easy to use.  The interface for email creation is very diverse and offers us a huge range of options for our email campaigns.  There are a few bugs when I try to click some buttons, but thats absolutely not a reason to give this app anything but 5 stars!
For a free platform, this is in the top of my list of Shopify apps that we use here at Clover Brand Outdoor Supply Co."
So far I like the ease of use. The interface is amazing. I enjoy the clarity of the video and images.
its nice. thanks for the nice integration of user interface and other things that make life easier!!
"Remarkably easy to use, as well as customize. Great alternative to MailChimp who give no support to free users. In fact I think Soundest is better than MailChimp with it's easier to use interface."
"Just started using Soundest and so far the interface is simple and easy to use. They practically set up my email marketing system before I even uploaded my logo. With everything I have to do running my store, I don't have time for the extra stuff. Thanks to the people at Soundest, I don't have to do the extras."
Vitals apps help me improve user experience. Every time I have a problem they help me solve it very quickly. The customer service is great. Keep up the great work.
"VITALS is THE all-in-one app you need - with all the relevant features to run a branded store (and more)! I've been in contact with them twice (Thanks, Costin & Alexandra) and their amazing customer support responds swiftly and solved the issues in a blink. The interface is user-friendly and simple to install. Kudos to the team for developing such a great app!"
"Amazing, after i downloaded this app it feels like there no need for me to add on 20+ over apps and find the right one. for 30$ a month id say its a bang! best part is that they are still keep adding on features. I just hope the team behind this doesn't get greedy like the rest and start marking up their price because the best selling point for this is its super cheap!+reliable+easy to use interface+good cs"
"I used Pinterest to grow my user interface , and promote my website! I love how user friendly it is!"
Great app. Really Needed it to improve the user experience. Used to use magento and the guys just imported for me into shopify. Thanks.
"One of the best app. I installed Best Currency Converter and it didn't work. Tried this app. The interface was really clean + the installation. Worked really well, thanks :)"
"Great app, very useful functionality, easy interface, great support, and works and functions as advertised. It's like having an email autoresponder system!!! I would recommend this app to all shopify store owners that are trying to build their email list."
"Unfortunately the Soundest app has left me extremely disappointed. The install did not successfully import my subscribers from Shopify (it failed to import the purchase dates which makes it useless). Support blamed shopify for the format of their output. The on-landing popup was not allowing some customers to enter their emails to retrieve a coupon which worries me a lot as I'm very concerned with my user experience. The help service - while friendly - was slow and unable to resolve the problem, so suggested I email them a full export of my customer/purchase data from my store which is something that violates countless privacy best practices not to mention shares sensitive personal information of my customers. 
This app does contain some great features but is not mature enough in my experience with their trial to warrant paying the $100ish/monthy they quoted me it would cost once my Trial was over. Hopefully in the future they find a way to resolve many of the bugs and perhaps at that point I'd reconsider because it feels like they're 70% the way there, but reliability, repeatability, and automation are missing - the most important things to a store owner like myself!"
I am very happy with this review app. I tried several different apps before landing on this one and it is definitely the best. Very easy interface to use and integrates well with my theme and other apps I have installed. Customer service is always quick to answer as well.
"Easy to use software, very good integration with Shopify.
User interface is simple and nice. Has a  feel good factor.
Support is very nice, responsive.  Support team responds to solving glitches in a very positive and constructive way.
Pricing is very reasonable.
Highly recommended !

This app and the developer is excellent! I needed a small customisation to help make the review interface look neater and cleaner and match my brand look. They did this at lightning speed! Fantastic app and customer support! I highly reccomend them!
"Useful tool very user friendly.  Love the ability to pull products with images and descriptions and create my own template using a WIX style interface, also as a developer I love the freedom to be able to add my own html code if I choose to do so."
Just sent our first email! Very easy user interface with a drag and drop function. I was able to create a professional looking email quickly.
"Really helpful support staff! I had requests to better understand the implementation and help ensure a great user experience, and they were super helpful and responsive! I recommend this review app for sure!"
Great App and good service follow up. We weren't sure about the interface at first but found that the functionality to be quite thorough.
"Vitals is amazing -- and support is top notch! Every Shopify store needs to run Vitals. I'd say that's true even if you run just a few apps like we do. The apps here are coded FAR better than most, and are hosted properly on Cloudflare's servers.  Vitals is impossible to beat!
To the developers: What would be really cool is if the internal reviews system could auto-sync to a dedicated review service regularly. We run Growave and may move to Stamped or even Yotpo. 
Keeping the internal reviews in sync with the review system we use would allow the Vitals to use the star rating in recently reviewed and related products. That'd make using your apps much more powerful. I love to see those star ratings everywhere!
Alternatively, we could consider using the Vitals review system natively if you asked Q&A. That's a feature we find essential. 
The other killer feature of review system would really be SEO and microdata. Whatever leads to better ranking is ultimately the system we're going to go with. Since your programmers seem to be smarter than most, I bet you could beat most systems on the SEO front.
There was also an British made review system that did something ingenious. They used Typeform to gather reviews. Friends of ours used it on their site. That got far more reviews than normal due to the fantastically fun interface Typeform has. Consumers just seem to participating with Typeform.
If Typeform is affordable by API for developers like you, perhaps that's something else you can consider? They have that ""addictive UI"" thing going on that perhaps you can just bolt on, and let Typeform figure out how to make it even more addictive with time.
Thanks for your consideration!"
It was a very user friendly process to set up - well done to the team on making the interface with the merchant in mind.
"Customer support is AMAZING. Interface is meh, but honestly the support is great, just great, super great"
"wow i really love this app, it makes the user experience so much easier and smoother to use without any additional work!"
"Easy installation, great interface, awesome price compared to competitors, and the service is top notch. I can't wait to start collecting tons of reviews effortlessly!"
"The interface is a little bit clunky, but don't let that put you off. This brilliant little app has so many different tools, it's well worth the investment.  Every time I think I've plumbed the depths of its capabilities, I find something new and neato that it can do!"
Awesome Keep it up the good work Easy to understand and interface is appreciable... Just a word Awesome
very easy interface and an effective email flatform in increasing sales.
Very easy-to-use interface and looks great on the website. The support is ridiculously quick and helpful. Shoutout to Mark and Bilal!
Just created my first campaign.  Really intuitive.  Love the drag and drop interface.  Would definitely use again.
The ability to pick products straight from the website and drop them into the email is one of the coolest things and hardly available in other apps. The interface is interactive and easy to use. It is worth a 5 star rating.
"If you're looking for a review app, LOOK NO FURTHER. THIS IS IT.
I recently installed this app to provide minimal customer reviews and I'm frankly taken aback by the ease, facility and thoroughness with which the entire front-end and back-end user experience this designed. My only regret is not having discovered it earlier."
Works as advertised.  User interface is simple and self explanatory. I would recommend this app to other store owners.
"VITALS promises a faster load speed and better user experience - and it sure follows up with gusto! Though we haven't used 70% of the available functions, we keep finding reasons to test them out. Makes its money back quickly - well worth the investment."
"We've been using Mail chimp for a while and suffering from sending decent email campaigns, with Soundest this problem has vanished, they have a very very friendly user interface that anyone can easily deal with and customize their campaigns the way they like without much effort.
In addition to their superb customer service support which is the BEST we've seen so far!"
30 seconds it was set up. Unreal how easy it is to use Shopify. I'm recommending it to everyone. The User experience is top notch.
"Why would you spend thousands of hours and thousands of dollars on a business that does not care and has no trained tech support? This company has horrible customer service that cannot fix problems created by Pinterest ""spam"" filters. You should not invest your time and money in Pinterest ads. Use something else: google ads, instagram, anything. We spent thousands of dollars on ads and art time on Pins, only to suddenly have our account suspended for ""spam."" Customer service wasted a month of our time and told us they could not contact their higher-ups or the ""spam"" team because those folks were too busy or ""in meetings"" or on vacation, etc. Eventually they GAVE UP trying to help and told us they could not do anything. They never gave us an explanation for the suspension. Basically, Pinterest sales reps are eager to sell you ads (the interface is horrible and confusing), but when things break - there is NO SUPPORT. UPDATE: INCREDIBLY, PINTEREST CONTINUES TO TRY TO BILL US FOR ADS THAT THEY NEVER RAN!!!!"
"Soundest is a combination of an email auto-responder and a cart abandonment recovery app plus a tight integration with the eCommerce workflow through various features to help us engage our customers via emails. The free plan offers basic email newsletter (15K free emails) and sign-up box features while the premium plan comes with all the bells and whistles. I like that it is specifically built with eCommerce in mind so the features they offer and the user experience are very natural fit for a online store owner. I've only used it for 24 hours and I have already setup sign-up box, pop-up box, welcome email series, and abandoned cart recovery email series for my store. Using their templates and designers made creating emails a breeze. Their support via Chat was fast and responsive as well. Though my experience with it is still brief, with their pricing being competitive to Mailchimp yet comes with more relevant features, I would recommend it for eComm store owners."
"All i can say is that the interface is more than user friendly, and i faced a problem and directly got support by their customer service, amazing product"
Very easy to use interface and no issues with setup. Can get all the basics you need with the free plan. Very clean and well done app!
Great app. Super easy to install and use. Gorgeous email interfaces easily customizable. One of the best apps on the Shopify market.
"This app is a bit friendler than the Facebook interface. While I am still having some issues, its not at frustrating"
Simple interface and impressive support team - love having live chat with an almost immediate response!!
Really love this app! Interfaces are easy to navigate and customer support is really friendly and knowledgeable! I would absolutely recommend this app to small business owners and e-commerce store keepers alike.
"Vitals might very well be the only app you'll ever need! Sounds like a bold statement but seriously, this app has like 90% of what you need on your store. 
It jam-packs more than 30 apps into one clever and easy to use interface - and best of all, they keep adding more!  
From small problem fixers (such as hiding your bestsellers, content protection or removing paypal button from cart) to more serious money making machines like Frequently Bought Together bundling, volume discounts or currency converter, you get a ton of features and it's all under one roof !
One of the best things is that you can ask the developers to tweak any of the included apps and they do it in a matter of hours. Just try it on your store, you'll see by yourself."
"This is an AMAZING app.!!  The value is incredible, the interface is very easy to use, and the customer support is the best I have seen (I'm not new to Shopify). Get this app, you will not be disappointed. Truly amazing."
"GREAT APP! Thank you guys for the great service, templates and easy to use interface!"
"i've been using soundest for about three years now, since i started my website, and i've been really very happy. over the years, i've seen the functionality expand a lot, and service has been really good. the interface is really simple to work with, and yet flexible at the same time. highly recommended!"
"Hi, I have two e-commerce platforms and i use Soundest in both! Great app, it works very well, cool user experience, intuitive and easy to use. Yes i will recommend it to a friend. Go Soundest, go easy! :)
Romeu"
"Great App
Best User-Interface ever, easy to manage and effective in operation
Highly Recommended"
Easy integration into website interface. detailed tutorial and does what is needed. Would recommend to anyone.
How can you go wrong for free? This is a must have if you don't want to pay those other guys ridiculous fees. Really love the design interface. Everything is very easy to use and makes my emails look so professional.
"Great app that solve my problem, Super recommended. With awesome interface. Must have for a new Shopify store owner."
"One would naturally assume that, by uninstalling an app, you'd also be removing the code that the app set up on your site...wouldn't you?  I uninstalled this app but all of the test buttons and other code i experimented with through this app have remained stuck on my site.  Not being a programmer, i've got no idea what changes this app has permanently made and where i'd find them in my code to remove them.  Really, really unhappy.
And to make matters worse, i can't install the app again to try and undo the changes through their own interface."
"I tried this app because I needed pricing options (or I thought - I found a way around it with ShopPad Infinite Options which was SUPER easy and FREE and I love it!). This app was a flop and a total pain in the hiney, and $20/month+ is too much considering all the work you have to do to install and keep it going. For that monthly price, they should do it all for you, then charge you the $20/month+. This app had what seemed like countless lines of code I had to enter. The app glitch badly, not because of my copy/paste coding, but just with its interface with my theme I guess. Customer support didn't want to help figure it out, so we'll never know. When it continued to glitch BADLY (as in - items couldn't be removed from the cart, etc), customer support blamed me, said it was in the coding and I'd have to find it : - / .  When I decided to uninstall it (this was after a WEEK'S worth of labor getting all the variants in and coding per their instructions), it left remnants in my coding, which I didn't put there - apparently it automatically installs code EVERYWHERE. It took careful searching on EVERY page (literally, every html/css page, snippet and asset to find all the remnants.) And it was obvious that there were remnants. On my storefront, staggered among the images, was incomplete coding ""liquid error"".....all over the place. Pricing options are what I needed, but after using this app, it's better to find a workaround if you can and use ShopPad Infinite Options instead."
"Straightforward to use, it has a good easy-to-use interface for us and our customers and the reviews have helped to get us noticed by search engines. Had some problems with Google showing the reviews at first - sorted within a day by Judge.me after I emailed them. Good app."
the interface is slightly confusing to find things but customer service makes up for it. Amazing support and friendly! App works great and seamlessly even though I am not using a standard theme. Very happy customer.
"I like the interface of it because it is easy to use and free for the trial.  Therefore, I have chance to review it."
Confident in this apps ability to generate leads for us. Interface is very user friendly and provides lots of advice.
"This App was exactly what our business needed. I literally couldn't run my business without it! We sell highly customizable high-end flutes, lots of options, and our clients wouldn't have it any other way. Bold's Product options app is easy to use, the interface is easy to understand, and the support has been fast, easy, and inexpensive (when we needed some custom work done). Really great app!"
Free plan does NOT convert currencies automatically. Only paid plan :(  That's too bad cause I liked the interface of it. Developer should consider adding this feature in the free plan.
"Just installed the app, but so far so good. Very easy interface. Lots of custom options in the free tier."
it is good tool for marketing and saving pins. I enjoy scrolling around on pinterest a lot. like the user experience and how i can easily navigate throughout the page
"I use this app for reviews on my website and love it. I like that I can choose the carousel design that I want for my main page on the website, as well as translate it in my local language in 2 clicks and the interface is really user-friendly. Also very fast and helpful customer support. Recommend it."
"Très simple d'utilisation, efficace et j'adore. L'interface utilisateur est simple et facile a utiliser."
"Simply, WOW. I have been working with another app for some time now and have always been very frustrated and never really got what I needed from it. I decided to try Judge.me, and I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER! The app fulfills all of our store needs and gives us options we didn't really know were possible in such a simple way. The user interface is very simple and customization made extremely handy, so the app works so beautifully with our brand. Again, very happy!"
I really like the functions of this app. Quite easy to use. Good user interface and explanatory guidelines.free countdown plugin. Very practical.
i really like the functions of this app. Quite easy to use. Good user interface and explanatory guidelines.
Love the app and the interface and the look of the the special countdown timer for products on my store look really awesome..
"Though I found that the initial user interface of configuring the widget and review request email unintuitive and tedious, the customer service that I received more than made up for my frustrations. I was switching from Shopify Reviews to Judge.me, and Juan helped troubleshoot all issues and install the app to my theme extremely quickly, all while making little adjustments to ensure that the app matched the site style. Above and beyond. Thanks again!"
"Brilliant reviews app at a reasonable price for all-in-one feature set.
Amazing support and great user experience."
Great support as always. Easy to use with intuitive interface. Most diverse Custom Product app I have used. Our products offer a wide selection of options and this app handles it easily.
Thank you for the program very cool many functions needed simplicity of understanding and convenient location key interface language accessible and simple
"Firstly, excellent support. I had some issues with pre-selecting radio buttons in order to activate the conditional logic immediately upon loading of the page. Solved by excellent support from the app developers.
Secondly, clean interface with good customization options. If you need to have options to specific products, this is probably the best app out there for this purpose.
Good job guys. Keep up the good work."
"I would give 10 STARS to M-C, a member of the customer support team, who went so far above and beyond to help me. She never got annoyed by my questions, and after waiting FOREVER to get help from the app support, she figured it out for me. THANK YOU!!!
I would give 3 starts to this app in general.... If it weren't for M-C I wouldn't be able to use it. We paid for the installation, and it had extraneous code in both customer email notifications and Order Invoices, as well as the checkout. M-C fixed all three issues (THANK YOU).... and to my knowledge no one else on the support team has yet to address it app-wide.
The app has so much potential. It is really really great. I just wish that the team would take these design issues seriously. They relate to User Experience. No matter how cool the app is functionally, all a customer will see is ""why is there extra code on my page"" and they won't appreciate the function.
I look forward to the team polishing and finishing this app, updating it, and I really hope they give M-C a raise!!!!!"
"I'm so happy with this app so far! Their User interface is so well organized and clear to setup, and their customer support team responds immediately. Just upgraded! :)"
"We use this app for multiple reasons and couldn't operate our store as effectively without it. Installation is very easy and quick. The team are also quick to respond and assist with more complicated issues. The interface is easy to follow, and there are lots of options with regards to communicating with potential customers, rewarding customers, nudging customers, providing clear and honest product evaluation. Judge.me has helped us to convert customers and bring in new ones. Of that, we have no doubt."
"If you plan on doing Product Options, this is the app you need to get. Super-intuitive interface (although it does time-out if you're working on a long option list, so save often!), excellent customer service, and very powerful. Forget creating matrices of different options. Just create the options, select the products you want it applied to, format any conditional logic (if you need it), and BAM, you're done. You can apply these options across hundreds of products at once. Also, as an added benefit, you can link options to real products, which is how most of our options are setup. AMAZING!"
"Very flexible app and great support. Interface is quite a learning curve and not intuitive, but if you persevere you can have a lot of power without learning to code or hire custom dev. work."
"Very amazing app! Our whole store is based on customization, and this app has made our lives that much easier! The interface, and ease of use, is hands down first class! Great support, and very friendly staff as well!"
Nice and simple. It was quite easy to use across the board. Now questions so far. thank again Shopify for carefully thinking through the user experience for us!
"We worked with Travis at BoldApps and his communication was awesome! They are super easy to get a hold of, and did a great job of answering all of my questions (and there were quite a few). Their team is very knowledgeable and eager to help in every way! We are very excited to start implementing the capabilities of their application which will allow is to vastly improve our user experience. Thanks guys!"
First time user.  simple interface.  Almost step by step.  Wish there was a chat feature when you have short questions.  Take your time.
"Super easy to use and I love that it's unbranded. Also, I had an issue with how the bar was showing up in mobile, emailed support, and got an email and a solution back within five minutes. (It reacts differently to different themes and the solution is actually built into the interface already, I just hadn't seen it.)
Am very pleased."
MUITO BOM ADOREI A FORMA FÁCIL DE UTILIZAR E CONFIGURAR O APLICATIVO QUE TEM UMA ÓTIMA INTERFACE DE USO. USEI O RELÓGIO CONTADOR 5 ESTRELAS.
Get it now. Simple and intuitive user interface. Plenty of features with the Free plan! Upgrading soon.
This app is what my store has been missing for the last two years. Well thought out and a simple interface.
"A Must have app! You can schedule your messages, promotions or flash sales in few clicks. And the interface is very user-friendly.
Highly recommended"
"This app offers features of similar solutions that cost considerably more, the interface is very easy yet powerful in the amount of customization, and most importantly the support is truly best in class. From setup to marketing in minutes. Can't recommend this any more!"
"I have a small company so I used this app to help with promoting my e-commerce business. This app helped me grow my business exponentially and the interface is user friendly. I highly recommend all business owners to use Pinterest as the app makes it easier for potential leads to see your products which help drive traffic  to your website. 
The only issue that I have is that it is sometimes difficult to navigate between several accounts."
"INITIAL REVIEW: So far so good; I haven't seen anything else like this available for Shopify, and having a good options platform was key to me switching over to Shopify from my previous e-commerce platform. 
Using this app can get a bit tricky in setting up multiple options with conditional logic, but that's not necessarily a fault of the app. Time will tell if I can get my head around everything possible with this feature-rich app. 
- - - - -
UPDATED, ONE YEAR LATER: 
This is the greatest app ever, and is helping our customers immensely to customize their guitar parts at our shop. We offer so many options, and it is important to us to have a clean interface. It has been a huge battle, but using conditional logic we have been able to set up a system which accomplishes what we need. 
In addition, the customer support by Bold has been top notch. In particular, the support staff members Shubhneet and Henrique really helped us dial everything in when we thought it was going to be too complicated, or not look right with our store. They worked the magic and got us going again. Three cheers for this app and the team behind its development, as well as the support team."
"This is a great app! Exactly what our store needed to personalize our products. Straight forward installation instructions and the support team is there if you have questions. The app interface is flexible and easy to use. Great job Bold team!
Check out our store to see the personalization in action - corksandconfetti.com"
"I downloaded the app and had an announcement bar on my website in a total of 2 minutes. Easy to use interface, with many free option and the banner looks professional on my website. Love it! Thanks Hextom!"
"Really easy to use, user friendly interface!  All you have to do is plug your info in and you're good to go. I'm Excited to start using it!!!!"
"aWESOME GREAT PRODUCT, WILL KEEP INSTALLED, MAYBE MORE PRODUct options in future. thanks again for interface options"
"I just started using this app. But I have some experience in E-commerce, All I can say features what they offer definitely gonna boost my sales and user experience on my store."
"They are the best we have used.  We have tried multiple shipping interfaces and ShippingEasy has been the easiest to work with.  They listen to their customers and make necessary changes/tweaks on the fly with there team if needed.  Great customer service and support which is always nice, very quick answers!!! 
Extremely easy to use overall, very user friendly."
"Great service.  Very good user interface.  Works as promised, with powerful USPS and UPS integration."
"It's seamlessly integrated with Shopify, with great rates WAY cheaper than if I shipped directly on the USPS site. Everything is easily tracked, customers are kept up to date, and the interface is stellar and easy to use. Their customer support is phenomenal!"
"Realizing the intricacies of different platforms communicating with one another, I was expecting various issues would arise in the early stages.  There were none!  A couple of minor questions about ""How To"" were answered through the extremely responsive Chat tool.  It wouldn't have been any easier if I had an expert ""IT"" guy in the next office. Efficient, cost-effective, and convenient with an exceptionally intuitive interface."
I tried a few other product apps and this one has the most functionality.  The user interface is easy to understand and navigate.  Thanks Bold for a great product.
Awesome interface and easy to use! You can choose a wide variety of tactics to boost your sales and increase conversions
"It's a great app with great features, and if your theme code doesn't work, their staff will quickly help you install it, and the user experience is great!"
"Great app, quick support! The chat feature for customer support is great. Wish the interface was a bit more user-friendly."
We LOVE Shipping Easy! Moving from stamps.com to Shipping Easy is one of the best decisions we've made in 2014. Their user interface is super easy to learn and their support is responsive and informative. Great product!
Everything has been smooth sailing so far and I really couldn't ask for more - integrates with Shopify so well and makes the shipping process SO much easier. Really easy interface and nice and clean which I appreciate!
"This Free App is the perfect choice for start-up Shopify stores. Interface is clean and friendly, system is well organized and powerful. Easy to use and works great! The most important thing is, their customer service is the best!"
"Excellent app.  Our entire labeling and shipping process takes maybe 5 minutes where before we were doing the cut/paste with usps which took well over an hour each day.  The developer has even been in touch by phone a couple of times just to see how everything is going.   A personal touch not often seen.  We tried the three other ""top reviewed"" apps and the interfaces were unfriendly and too complex for a low volume shipper like us.  With the free endicia account, you can't beat the price!  Very impressed with their product and support."
"I use both eBay and Shopify so I spent most of my day going back and
forth between shops copy pasting addresses into a shipping
application. I used to have to hand enter every address and then try
to figure out shipping weights and rates. I spent more than three
hours a day just getting mailing labels and shipping invoices
completed.
Shipping Easy has made my shipping a breeze, I actually look forward
to sitting down with my morning coffee and with one click all my
orders are ported into Shipping Easy, just a few clicks more I am
printing labels and Invoices in less than half and hour.
I am saving two and a half hours a day, which frees me up to do more
important things like talk to my customers and and promote my
business. Some mornings I just give myself the time I've to go for a
walk or call a friend.
The interface is easy to use and even shipping overseas is easy to do
as everything is spelled out clearly and the form is user friendly.
When I've had questions I have always been taken care of right away
and been able to get right back to work instead of being on hold
listening to terrible music or waiting for a response email for days.
I would never consider giving up Shipping Easy, they made the least
favorite part of my business,(shipping), into an enjoyable experience
I look forward to using.
Thank you Shipping Easy for making my Shipping so easy!"
"This app has saved us SO much time.  We ship using USPS Priority Mail and the integration between our Shopify store & ShippingEasy is so great.  ShippingEasy pulls each order and the product weight directly from our site. Now we can generate & print shipping labels with just a few clicks.  
I found the interface at ShippingEasy a little bit difficult to use at first. A customer service rep called me after they noticed I'd signed up but wasn't using the service. She was so helpful, showed me how everything worked, and I love ShippingEasy now. Great customer service."
"ShippingEasy has been incredible for us!
We found ShippingEasy by accident before we launched our Shopify Store and we are so happy they were with us as we launched our store.
Before ShippingEasy we used another Shipping App that was really clunky and hard to use. When I saw ShippingEasy's interface I knew it was the app for us.
Through-out the entire store launch process ShippingEasy walked us through setup, provided personal customer support contact information and constantly answer every question we through at them.
As a fellow small business we are really proud to support ShippingEasy. On the rare instance they didn't have an answer or we were having extra problems they went above and beyond to solve our issues!
I can't imagine choosing any other shipping application.

"Just switched to Shipping Easy from a previous shipping app. It's far superior in pretty much every way. Much better flow and interface than what I was previously using. Not to mention, still being a company with a relatively small shipping volume every month - the fact that they only charge shipping costs - not an additional fee, is awesome. Very happy with them."
"Just installed, its design is very user-friendly. Always good at collecting opinions, it looks really good. Very comfortable on the interface."
"This APP is very easy to use, completely free, I especially like to use, you can use to see.Interface simple, easy to use easy to use easy to use easy to use easy to use easy to use easy to use easy to use easy to use"
I really like this app. It's easy to install and clean interface. Good customer support! Thank you so much!
"This App is easy to use, great looking interface and sticky button with a nice amount of customisation. Also have great support from the developers if you have any problems."
"Awesome App... Awesome Customer Support... Everything is Awesome...
Nice Interface... Recommended..."
"Great application and also very useful in showing customers the price in their favourite currency, however, I wish it would look more presentable on my store interface."
"Judge.me is the preferred review app by my developer, Realm Developers. This app has a ton of features and support is lightning fast. The interface is easy to use. I like the feature where customers can use the app to ask questions about a specific product."
"Ok, this is a MUST have app for any shop in my opinion! I am SO very glad that I found it. I was so surprised when I set up my shop to discover that Shopify did not have a way to add product options inherently as a part of the platform. I found another app that I was using, which  was better than nothing but was still a very manual process. Then I stumbled upon THIS app. I am scratching my head as to how I missed this to begin with, but this app is exactly what I needed. Not only is the interface sleek, user friendly and intuitive, but the this app makes adding countless options to your products a BREEZE. I sell personalized products and so having something like this is a absolute necessity for me. 
This lets you create an option set (for example color choices) one time, then go in and choose the products, collection or product type for which that option should apply to. This means a HUGE time saver for you because you do not have to go product by product to add your options (which the other app I had required I do). OMG, such a business saving time saver. Also when you add new products all you have to do is refresh your lists and bam, you are done.
If you offer any kind of product options/variations for your customers (be it size, color, personalization, file uploads, style, etc), you NEED this app."
User-friendly interface and great marketing tools that were quick and easy to set up. Looking forward to seeing how they perform!
"Very friendly interface,useful even free version. Although I still trying but probably will upgrade to paid version."
"Awesome plugin for automatic currency switching. Good user experience, easy to install, easy to operate. Optimized for website selection"
This helps to increase the user experience of our Online Store. Our store customers are really happy with this application.
This application is super!! This helps to increase the user experience of our Online Pet Store. Our store customers are really happy with this application.
They are some free competitors but apps works fine (even though the interface is pretty old-fashioned) and has some nice settings. Support was really helpful and fast.

"[Update] I have updated my review to 5 stars. I tested this app, Rivyo, YotPo and Smile.io and so far think this app has the best blend of features and price as far as review apps go. After 1 month of using this app, I think it's one of the best apps OVERALL for my small business. I was extremely impressed when their product manager actually contacted me after my initial 4 star review and wanted more details about my issues with the UI/UX (user interface/experience). I'm also a product manager, so wrote something up for them with some recommendations and they've actually implemented a few of them! Further, my dev LOVES their code--it's clean and extremely efficient, and lightweight. Talking about UI and code might not sound sexy, but your site running faster is incredibly important (that's why Shopify shows your speed rating in the dashboard). I'm very happy with the new features they're adding and the pricing they're proposing. I still think the UI could use more polish, but you absolutely want apps that don't inject junk code into your store so I think that's a perfectly fine trade-off. I have no doubt they'll continue to make improvements to their UI as they're constantly making updates and improvements."
Support has been great so far and the interface is easy to use. Allows for some great pop up campaigns and other marketing features.
"Very good app. The excellent free alternative to Oberlo. Nice interface and really easy to use.
Would be even better if there was the Suggested Price option (in the import section).
Kind Regards"
"Would definitely recommend, easy integration and friendly user interface. Best for small businesses. Most importantly great customer service"
"No sweat to install, much much better to default facebook defaults chat. simple and effective interface. Great job for the developers.. just Awesome :)"
"It's hard to compete with the deep functionality (yet very easy user experience) of the Judge.me app! Once you add it to your store, you'll learn why it's the top-rated review app. ☺️
Their support team is also incredibly excellent, offering stellar support on design fixes and other troubleshooting. Thank you so much for the super fast, relentless fixes!"
The app's interface is really good and easy to understand. Would definitely recommend it to colleagies
Great App with easy to use interface. The free version is good enough for new startups.
"This is a great app to use for the Pop Up. This a good app to use for E-mail marketing and for Launching new products. I really like how seamless and flawless the user interface is. The Representative, Aditi, helped me to understand how to use the Timer Feature inside the Pop Up Tool."
"We switched to Judge.me and have been very pleased.  The process for migrating was exponentially easier and more intuitive when compared to our former provider and we have found that the Merchant and End User experience is much better as well.  Unlike other providers that had high prices and a questionable ROI, this is one app that can be rationalized with great features and Customer Service to deliver in spades as your business grows."
"Awesome app, awesome service! A real peace of mind and they provide you with all you need regarding the reviews! Emails to customers, reviews on fb, widgets on the website. The only downside is the user interface which could be better but I will never take a star away because of that. Keep up the great, great work!"
Great but would like more interface with the website. I used this on my first page and it was really good
"Absolutely love this app, so simple and straight forward, even for beginners, and the user interface is so easy to use"
Excellent App!  Very easy to install and is already boosting our sales!  Great way to direct customers to purchase items they may never look for on your site.  Very easy interface and runs beautifully!
Quick response very easy to use and amazing interface to deal with. I have tried many apps but this one is really good to handle.
"Works great and the support is wonderful! Thank you!
Their support team helped me work through all of the challenges I was having. I wish things were a bit more clear from a user experience perspective, but a strong support team made up for it!"
"I highly recommend  this app. They've made it so easy for my customers to leave reviews and the interface is fairly straight forward. If I can't figure something out, I email customer service and they always handle it in a reasonable amount of time. Definitely a great addition to my store and an overall good investment!"
This app is great and does exactly what i need. The welcome popup is easy to design and the interface is very user friendly
"This app works great to automate collecting real reviews! There are multiple options for displaying it on our site, and it loads quickly on the product pages. Their customer support is very helpful as well, whenever we have had any questions about setting up the app. The user interface takes a little getting used to but is definitely usable, and lower monthly cost than most comparable apps I have seen. Overall highly recommend!"
I really loved this app's easy to use interface..I would recommend it for a better store conversion..
very nice application，  user interface is very friendly to use~ luckily i can get this application to improve my website
Just installed Automizely and was able to set up first first pop up in just a few minutes. Very intuitive interface that requires no technical skills. Looking forward to the benefits.
"Easy user interface and the customer service is on point, just like I saw on the reviews. Haven't used it much but am sure it'll get the job done! And it's free, can't beat that."
Incredibly good and fast service via chat. Even in German! The interface is totally intuitive and not as complicated as with some paid providers. All customer data is imported directly with one click. I am absolutely thrilled!
"Support is out of this world. Had a little issue, and they immediately fixed it within not even 2 minutes. Judge.me is probably the best review system we have used, and the interface is super simple to use and straight forward. Thank you!"
"its simple n easy to use. easy interface, customer friendly. nice design on it......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................"
"Very nice app with an excellent interface. Customer service is excellent,replies within few minutes. I highly recommend this app. It does what it does excellently."
"It's practically useless, constantly removes products from feeds. really hard interface to work with. literally this app makes the job so much harder. You'd think as they advertise ease of use that Google would get this sorted asap...2 years deep same issues as when I started. customer service is terrible aswell...failed to respond to 20 emails about the same issue....use a third party app"
"Easy install, simple interface and nice design. What more could you ask?

The user interface is easy to use and simple. especially the onboarding process is minimal. I like it :-)
"App was easy to use, not yet sure if it will help boost sales but I like it so far. Hmm just realize that it needs me to write 100 characters. Clean interface no tutorial required to understand how it works."
"Product Upsell is an app that won't disappoint! It integrates perfectly. It's user interface is easy to understand and implement. And if questions do arise, their level of customer support is incredible."
Started this app today and the customer service is very quick to respond. Interface is user-friedly as it is similar to Shopify. Email formatting could be expanded.
"I recently installed this app after trying many options to drive social proof and sales signals to customers who visit the store. Firstly, I still cant get over the fact that this app is FREE! I was already using Aftership from Automizely and was quite satisfied with it so went ahead with trying this and it's absolutely amazing that it offers features that many of the paid products were lacking. The interface is intuitive, the popups and countdown timers merge right in with my theme and it works like a breeze. I'm yet to fully explore the potential but as of now, its all amazing! Support is prompt and very responsive too."
"This app is amazing, it helped me a lot to increase my sales. also it's easy to use and very friendly user experience"
"I am using the currency - Singapore dollar. The Google Channel interface automatically prompts you to select only one country. Thus, in Google Shopping, the feed is available only for one market country, which is extremely inconvenient. Also, after I created a Shopping campaign in my Google Ads account and linked the feed, I couldn't find any products. They simply do not appear as if they are not there. Can this be fixed and how?"
"Nice interface, easy to navigate through the app. Gives really good options for the free version. Thank you for that!
We haven't launched yet, but looking forward to see the app in action!"
"It is a great price with outstanding service. The interface could be simpler but the important thing is, it's a great value and they are so helpful."
"Great App, Great User Interface and above all Great Support team. Hands down. Definitely recommended."
The app is great! The interface is a little outdated in my opinion but you can get used it very quickly! The options offered price-wise are amazing and extra thumbs up for the team! They try their best in helping and are always quick to reply.
This app is amazing and very easy to setup in order to get call to actions and other great marketing flows setup in minutes. I now have great user experiences with excellent incentives to offer new and returning customers. Highly recommended!
I used this app to help me with email marketing and I love how easy and convenience the interface to work with and the staff is super nice and helped me solve the problem right away! Highly recommend!
"Since social proof is critical to building relationships with online (and beyond) customers for success, we're very happy to have found Judge.me (after much searching/testing)! We love the flexibility that the backend offers to customize the content for reviews and Q&A, in addition to the customizable look-and-feel to integrate well with our store (www.thexshop.xyz). While we only recently installed the app, we highly recommend the app based on its user-interface, functionality, ROI, and our experience so far with their customer service, as their support team has been amazing: prompt, helpful, and friendly! We highly recommend this app, and we're looking forward to further testing it out as our reviews and Q&A's are populated."
"Love the app. Started with the free version, but then saw amazing functions with the Awesome plan and signed up for it. Really great app, smooth interface, quick and helpful customer support. Definitely a great help for the store!"
"Much better than other apps! The user interface is very simple, stylish and friendly. Exactly what I was looking for :)"
"very fast and easy, i was not sure about the payment and contact review but the interface was easy to use."
"easy to use ! thanks for the smooth interface and easy instructions , def going to upgrade as my store grows"
Just started using this app. The customer service is lightning quick and the user interface is very easy to use. Would recommend highly.
"Has a very good user interface unlike some other apps I've tried. Can do pretty much anything you want for Free at the time I'm writing this. If you need help there's someone always ready to chat and walk you through it. I'm happy with the customization interface because it works very similarly to a shopify theme whereas some other apps have annoying setups that require you to format, move detail the elements in a buggy difficult manner. This one is easy to use and has a lot of options."
very help and fast customer service operators the interface its really easy to follow as i have used others that just didn't integrate with my site but this seemes to working well so far
"Excellent usability, options and user experience! I've had to reach out to support multiple times for assistance and they have been nothing short of amazing! Would recommend!"
"The support is amazing, and I like the interface. It is easy to setup. I wish they would make the interface a little cleaner and clearer though."
"If you have a Ton of images bogging down your site, this is certainly an app you will want to get. With that being said you will want to subscribe to the paid plan, since the free plan simply will not be enough to compress all images. Before using on my site https://www.catshatsandmore.com my page load time was horrendous. After utilizing the the 70% compression, which I truely can not notice a difference, I have seen my site https://www.catshatsandmore.com page load times increase drastically! My google user experience score is no joke 100/100! Certainly recommend this app to any who have a lot of images. Does exactly what they say it will!
   For all you cat lovers out there, check out my site and tell me what you think. https://www.catshatsandmore.com"
"Interface is very intuitive, includes a set of very useful and common things (emails, popups). Support is quick and very helpful!"
Really Happy while using app. Thank You soo much for Google For providing such a Great User Experience.
"Being a full-time web designer, I've been through too many apps to count, review ones especially. Judge.me has a super easy-to-use dashboard interface. You'll never have to search too hard to find what you need, including support from the Judge.me team.
Support, as with most apps, is key to making my job an easier one. Everyone I've discussed issues with has been prompt, professional, and has given their maximum efforts to assist. I thoroughly appreciate them, this app, and all the wonderful features it has. Great Job Team!"
"Great, interface and easy to use, and I am amazed by their free email quote. Definitely will recommend trying once and it's free."
"Amazing app, works great and actually displays reviews in a legit interface, unlike other apps. Support is great too."
Great customer service and amazing features all in one app at no extra fee. Everything is automated and has a great user friendly interface.
"Great customer service, fast response also. App has a friendly interface. Provide everything I need."
"Great app ! Many customization options even in free version, great interface and outstanding support! Really, they replayed in 5 mins for my mail with question how to fix a problem and fixed the problem immediately, really appreciate it!"
"very nice and intuitive,the interface is funny, i am very happy to found it this day, thanks a lot for the job!"
Always very responsive support when our theme updates. Super quick and simple task to add features and the user interface is great. Highly recommended.
"We use this app for reviews on our online store.  Easy for customers to leave reviews, and has several options for auto or hand approval of reviews.  Clean display and customer interface.  Great customer support if you need the app tailored to your specific needs!"
Great app. The interface is really user-friendly and it will help me a lot to boost sales on my site
"Speedy customer service and an easy to understand interface, value can really be found in this app cant wait to integrate it."
"Ok so I have to say that I had started HATING this tool. And the reason for that is the interface, which is NOT intuitive AT ALL. (still isn't)
BUT, I pushed through, and they've got two things that they did better than anyone else :
- AMAZING customer service and technical support, almost 24/7
- access to A LOT of features
- For a fraction of the price competitors charge
If you can hire a UX designer and fix that first horrible pain point, you will have a killer app. Structure and group the features better, have a better on boarding process.
Thanks again"
"Great app with easy interface, kind and fast customer servce. Easy to setup newsletters with nice templates. Highly recommend!"
Super Easy and Adaptable. Its fast and very simple to use. Amazing interface. Impact-full and noteworthy.
"Really easy install and it looks pretty good.  We just installed it the other day, but over 50% of our mobile visitors use the Ipad, so hopefully we'll have some user experience to report on pretty soon.
Thanks!"
"Amazing app good job guys. I like the interface, i casn't wait to see the change in my store. Hope you all the best on your good job."
"So far so good. Customer service is quick, user (merchant) interface is easy and intuitive. Still setting it up, will be back to leave a detailed review later on."
"An excellent app, that delivers in ease of use, and user experience.  Can't think of anything that would be a draw back for anyone to use this for delivering the best e-commerce experience to their tablet customers."
"Love this app, it has made collecting reviews a ""set it and forget it"" experience, and customer support is great! (use the chat on review.me, don't send an email). Interface can be a little clunky, but that's overshadowed by the excellence with which this app does its job. Lots of great integrations, and plenty of options. And ""Premium"" is only $15/mo, well worth it if your sales are up!"
"Automizely is a great marketing tool, easy to understand interface and have lots of features. This app deserves more recognition! And the best part is they provide top-notch support and get things done really fast."
"UPDATE! After a couple of years of using Judge.me I am even more thrilled with their customer service! They are always so helpful, polite and never make me feel like I'm a bother or asking too much. Did I say FAST? Thank you for being on my team! The Blissful Dog Reviews are a really big deal to us, as they are to everyone, of course. We had several thousand to move over and lots of images and I was worried, but the team at Judge.me jumped in and helped it all go smoothly. They even OFFERED to do a couple of extra things for me. How often does that happen? I love how the reviews look on the pages and the interface is easy to use. Thanks, Judge.me, I look forward to asking many more dumb questions and you patiently answering them!"
"Just started using the app, but so far so good. The interface is customer friendly, and provides lots of options. Customer Support is able to resolve any issue with speed, which is highly valued. We are excited to see what else we can do with the app."
"I like the robust interface very easy to use. I enjoyed the customization features as well, however the timer limit of 24 hours may be hindering the application."
I would like to recommend this app for all whom want to have email marketing in place. The support is very interactive and also to interface easy to use.
A good customer support system. Appreciate it. The help was given timely and issues were resolved with out a hassle. Nice User interface too. Highly recommend the application.
"PRO's. Good Product. Excellent print quality. Prints and ships FAST! If you are familiar with other vendors in this space then you know what a big deal these three items are. CON's, As a vendor, I manage hundreds of products in my store and the SPOD interface is lacking. It takes more effort than it should to manage SPOD products. I hope it can be redesigned."
"Excellent store-front customizer! A easy-to-use interface for clients to manipulate their designs and control all aspects of pricing. I only wish the pricing element was a little more cut-and-dry, but once you play around with it a little, it'll come to you - it's not difficult, just takes some time to understand, especially if you're listing different types of items and want to provide a different pricing structure for each item. I wish there was a better way to review previously-listed items and edit their design, but I saw passed it for the reason that EVERYTHING ELSE IS EXCELLENT. 10 orders so far, and my customers have notified me that their orders were shipped within 3-5 business days. Great turn-around, EXCEPTIONAL pricing!!!"
So far so good...just set up my Google Merchant Account on Shopify. Setting up ads soon. Interface simple and easy to navigate.
Easy to setup!!! guided to ensure listings were correct. Like the way the interfaced was click and go!!!
"I'm starting off with the free option as I launch my site, so no feedback yet on how it works.  But great interface, and easy to see what I can do now, and how I can upgrade to grow my business.  Thank you!"
Amazing app. It is exactly what i wanted for my store. Interface is very simple and the existing templates are easy to use.
"Great application and service, they responded quickly and were very timely with fixing the issue. Interface was easy to navigate"
SO far its great and im just trying things out seems to be easy to use and interface is great as well.
"I've tried a bunch of review apps in the past and nothing beats this one. The price point as well as the customer service has been nothing but superb. I used their live chat feature and Cesar was very quick to trouble shoot my problems. 
As for the app itself, the interface is wonderful and simple to use. The $15 price point for the features is well worth the price. The customization aspects allow you to integrate the reviews exceptionally well with your product site."
Facile à  utiliser et à prendre en main. J'ai fait déjà plusieurs ventes et je n'est pas utiliser l'interface à 100%
Great customer service! The interface is very easy to use as well. I've gained many new subscribers using this app
The interface is easy to use and the tutorials are helpful.  It's easier to keep track of where I am in the process for each store than just simply going to Google Merchant Center.  Thank you.
"Seamless application and smooth interface. I really appreciate the free, easy credibility and scarcity factor that this app gives my store."
"I am very grateful to you for helping me to do this
Very quick support helped me many times
recommend many good features, friendly interface"
"great product feed guide to google requirement, friendly interface, easy to setup and use, sync fast"
Solid interface and the support got my store fixed in about 15 minutes.
This app is seriously awesome. I've really been able to up my conversions from before with little tools and utilizing their easy to use interface. I'd highly recommend it for anyone who wants to increase sales.
Great and easy to use app and plus point its free a lot of options available with multiple customization interface is clean and nice took only 5 min to setup :)
"Like most of you, I'm far too busy to write reviews. However, I made an exception. 
Here goes: this product stands out because of the excellent support, easy interface, and low monthly cost. The Shopify theme I use has native support for tabs already, but it requires clunky manual editing and destroyed any WYSIWIG editing on my product pages, so I gave up and looked for a new solution. ""Product Description Tabs"" caught my eye with the customizable dynamic heading usage (we chose H6, you can choose whatever you like or just use all static tabs the same for every product) to turn any heading into a tab. This allows my employees to just write the descriptions and not worry about the coding, and I don't have to stress about something getting out of whack because someone (one of the many non-coders on our staff) ended a tag at the wrong place.
We've been using this only a few weeks, but the product is simple enough that we'll be able to quickly backfill all our products with tabs and have the whole store tab-i-fied in a month. We've already contacted the developer once for advice on a customization/workaround with our theme and I received a very helpful response in about 6 hours. On the weekend. Holy tabs, Batman.
In sum, you can pay the monthly fee for this product for 3 years and total up to the fee for about ONE HOUR of a Shopify developer's time here in Seattle. Can any dev you know add a simple H6-tag tabs solution to your theme in less than an hour? If so, please send them my way, because they're obviously the best Shopify coder on the planet. For everyone else that would pay hundreds of dollars to have this feature custom built, just buy this app instead. 
Thanks for making such an awesome product guys. Our drone product pages thank you!"
They were able to shave 2 seconds off the page load time and made many more updates to help optimize the speed which leads to a better user experience and more conversions.
"Just what I was looking for, it has a very easy interface and they have an active chat that works perfectly, they answered all my questions very quickly and effectively. Without a doubt I highly recommend it."
"Just St it up, waiting to see results. Interface and dashboard is great , easy to configure and understand."
I use this app for email marketing. It has sooo many pre-made templates. Great app for businesses that are just starting out because now I don’t have to spend all day thinking of what to put in each email. The interface is simple and easy to use. Customer support responds almost immediately. So happy I found this app!
"Extremely well made and genuine value, the user interface is really easy to get your head around and provides everything you need and more!"
"I am using the application recently and it has been very easy to configure, the interface is very intuitive and has everything that is required to enhance marketing in my store"
"It works great, really friendly, has an easy and fast interface. The customer service is fast. it should be try it."
"It has lots of useful features for the free plan, it is very intuitive and it has a simple design on the product page and the user interface itself"
I needed a simple sales timer for the deal of the day and inventory specials. This app has a nice interface and is easy to work with. Thumbs up!
"Simple and easy interface! There's not much you can do for the free plan but the things you can do are the essentials for trust and urgency, so it's worth it"
Grate app easy to use I would recommend this app to dropship companies easy to use user interface and dash bord
"We use this app at uranta.ca and uranta.com and we absolutely love it. The admin interface is incredibly intuitive and super simple to configure. The widgets on the site look great and are configurable -- the support is virtually instantaneous when we asked for theme tweaks (4 times now and they got it done in under 10 minutes). We love how you can share the reviews on facebook and twitter. It seems that the more we share the more reviews we are getting. Just implemented the coupon feature, let's see how that works. All in all a great app and worth paying the $15 a month. We tried every other review app first and then settled on this one."
"I have just installed this app, so far so good! Easy to navigate user interface. It's just what I'm looking for."
Easy to use. I had a great experience with google Ads implementation. The interface is clear and the user experience if very well. i had to do only some clicks. thanks.
"Excellent, definitely recommended! I didn't know it and I came to discover it to find out this is really amazing. I like the fact it is easy to use. I enjoy the user interface. I didn't enjoy the fact I have to rate it in order to be able to use it..."
Easy to use interface and has the best features that other products do not have. Recommend this app !!
"I don't check out just one app, I check them all out because that's what I do and I can tell you AVADA is hands down the easiest and most straightforward sizing app with all the power of any of the others. The interface is intuitive and guides you through the process with a few simple clicks. You can upload your own high quality sizing charts, easy breezy or create your own and can import your own spreadsheets. You also have the options to add background color, change fonts and customize everything completely to your taste and I must again stress that the process is very easy to do. Finally, you get all this for FREE and the support is the best out there. Candace is great and the support she gives me is always FAST, friendly, courteous, professional and knowledgeable. Five stars, no question."
"Best reviews app so far! I've definitely tried a few and this is by far the best. I've captured more reviews in such a short period of time, compared to other apps that I had been using for much longer. The user interface is easy to use and the reviews are automatically added to your site - no need to add any code to get it going."
"Great app, gives great tips and the interface is easy to use. Some of the tips the app provides are very complicated and require programming knowledge."
The plugin has been very useful to make progress with out store in marketing and user experience. Very feature rich and customizable.
"So far I like it, still exploring. looks promising but let's see how it goes. The interface looks easy as well."
"I have recently migrated to this app due to its pricing and SEO features. I am so glad I did, the loading speed of the app is so fast. Moreover, the interface is also easy to use and setup. Thumbs up to the Dev!!"
"This app is very easy to use and customize, interface running smooth, and look good in my Shopify themes. Recommended for any shop that needs a size chart. I hope the developer will add more color choices and functions in the future."
"Update Jan 2022: I can't say enough about their customer service, top notch in the industry! The answer right away and the solve any and all issues. Highly recommend! Update to my original review (18 months later): The app is great, I have tons of reviews and they display very nicely on my site. And the customer service is truly outstanding, they are super responsive and get the job done in a very short time. --------------
The What a great app! I can't say enough about the team at Judge.me. I actually started with them about 2 months ago, so this review covers a lot of time using the app. Everything has been perfect, with no issues at all. The app integration was easy and went without issues. Also, collecting reviews from past and current customers is also easy, and getting them on the site was straightforward too. I am not the most tech savvy person but found the interface to be easy to manage, and the customer service is 10 stars, they are highly responsive and helpful, I can't say enough about them and highly recommend using them too!"
"Great app! I was specifically looking for an in-email review system to make it easy for customers to review and hopefully increase the number of reviews i receive.
The interface is easy to understand and seems to have all the features i was after. I have just sent off the review request for previous orders and that all worked seamlessly.
The customer support was excellent also with the installation."
"By far the best company, best app, and best value you'll find on Shopify to handle your reviews.  I've tried many over the years, including YotPo (outrageously expensive) and Judge.me is far superior.  Don't give it a second thought, get on board with this app, you'll love the interface, the powerful features, and top-notch support."
"Judge.me has exceeded expectations. From the backend interface, to the customer support, Judge.me is one of my new favorite Shopify apps. Special thanks to Annie for her assistance this week. 
- MFI Medical"
Just installed the app and very impressed with it so far. The Judge.me team helps with the installation making it very simple. Overall the features it provides are quite robust. We were using Yotpo previously and this app is comparable but has a better user interface. It's def worth trying out for the price!
"Really great app, does what I need it to use with an easy to use interface. I definitely recommend, plus it's free."
"Really easy interface to use, especially for new users, and defenitely gonna give it a try for a few month"
So useful.Great Support team! Quick reply’s and the interface is easy to navigate. Thank you so much Automizely!!!!
I Genuinely love that its FREE and for company giving the market the oppurtunity to test value add offering. What I would love is a more emmersive user experience optimative approach and maybe look at integrating with easy to use and common used apps already created such as SHOPIFY email. All and all the automizely team value add is GOOD.
So far so good. Awesome customer support. Quick reply’s and the interface is easy to navigate. Currently working on getting everything organized so I can make everything live!
Very easy to use and simple user interface. Works great so far!
Very easy to use and customer service is great. Thank you guys for making it so easy! I like how the interface is so simple to understand.
"Previously we used Yotpo for our customer reviews - until they put the price up so much it was prohibitive. Found Judge.me and have gone onto the ""Awesome"" plan which allows customers to post photos of our products (then we have Judge.me feed them through to social media when it suits us). The interface is easy enough to use and they're making improvements all the time. Support is fast and fantastic. It was a breeze to import our old Yotpo reviews, so they weren't wasted. Now we get SO many reviews. ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND this app! Can't beat their customer service. www.resealablecellobags.com.au"
"I've been trying to set up what automizely provides using several other apps and let me tell you Automizely has done an AMAZING work here for us. The interface is very user friendly, it allows you to do what you need in a record time and the result is amazing. I'm obsessed, thank you Automizely. I really hope it stays free!!"
"5+ Stars for Judge.me.
Let me clarify a concerns in those few 1 star reviews which also troubled me before I actually install it. The widget's size is less than 80Kb after compression and does not affect any notable google speed score. 
The widget works perfectly with all the core functions some one could ever think of for collecting reviews, there's no trouble importing reviews with multiple pictures or whatsoever. You can send manual reviews, or import previous reviews and let them shown on site with the time mark you input for each review.
The widget concentrates specially on SEO features so it is highly recommend for those who want to show the review status on google search result page. Just started doing that now.
I know it sounds like a fake review but it is my actual user experience. The customer service staff are so incredible. EVERYONE of them are fast in response and resourceful. Solve your problem as much as they could from their end and literally, in my case, doing nothing but send requests. It's like flying with Emirates in the first class on a long time journey, completely trouble free experience! Great team!"
"We've tried a bunch of review apps in the past, and switching to Judge.me was a decision we wished we made sooner.
(Note: we started straight off with their paid plan, so this review is a reflection of that, can't comment on the free version)
Features:
The $15/month plan is packed with everything you'd need in a review app. Some of our favourite features: in-email review request, upload pictures for reviews, reviews carousel to feature on homepage, Q&A section, ability to reply to a review. Other apps charge you an arm and leg for these ""advanced"" features. These guys are doing it for $15.
Interface:
All the pretty stuff you see on the frontend is backed by a super user-friendly and easy to understand admin backend. Love how all the options are explained in proper sentences, which makes understanding the function of that particular setting so much easier. All the usual stuff you would want to tweak (email header, text, review star color, etc.) is easy to customize.
The process of managing and ""featuring"" a review in your carousel is also so simple, few clicks and it's done.
Customer service/Setup:
Wow they are quick. We got the app installed and fully integrated in a few hours. Some changes were required to get the app in the right spots, but PJ and Octavian are FAST. Changes made immediately, and code for our old review app replaced. Follow up emails were replied to promptly, it's like these guys never sleep.
Performance:
Within days of installing we could already tell it's a winner. The conversion rate was so much higher compared to our previous app, and we were getting many more reviews!
Conclusion:
Judge.me is a well thought out, feature-packed, easy-to-use, SOLID 10 STAR review app. Seriously, for $15 bucks?! INSTALL NOW."
"Clear and straight forward user interface - made it easy to get started from adding the app to importing products within minutes.
It would be better to show an indicator when importing of ""pending"" products is still in progress, as currently, the number only goes up when I refresh the page.
Why does Google Shopping not show up as a ""sales channel""?
Google product bulk editor doesn't seem practical for 30,000 products. How do I bulk edit all the fields easily as using the pager is impractical?
So many questions still to answer for me!"
"I've had it for a little over a week, so my interaction has been somewhat limited. I will say that customer service was spot on when I needed it. That matters most to me actually. the app is straightforward it seems. I will update or re-review in another two weeks. So far, I like the app a lot. Simple plug and play. The interface is simple. I am not a computer geek by any stretch of the imagination but if you can read, and follow instructions, they are clear."
I love Seguno! It's simple and intuitive with professional results. I've used other marketing systems that are hard to figure out..Seguno makes it really easy and because it is embedded within shopify it's just like an extension of the shopify interface so no new systems to learn. Love it!
"I was using mailchimp for my newsletter and blog notifications but I switched to Seguno and I am glad I did.  Way easier for me to use and I like the overall interface better.  Looks better to me too, so all in all a very good choice.  Good support too which to me is very important."
"This app is great in every sense: super easy to install, works very well mainly with its in-mail product review, the admin interface is easy to navigate and use and, the customer support is lightning fast and friendly. I instantly upgraded to enjoy all the goodies. Would definitely recommend."
"I am a grand-fathered ($30/month pro plan) Yotpo user and I wish I left sooner. Yotpo is out of touch with the majority of Shopify store owners and uses antiquated, slow loading scripts that ruin user experience and hamper SEO.
Judge.me has a FAST loading reviews system that does everything Yotpo does and more. I installed Judge.me at 1AM today and the developer was replying to my questions within minutes, even helping me install the badges to match my theme properly.
This is an excellent app that outperforms Yotpo at a fraction of the cost. Support this company!"
This app helped me increase my sales and the best thing about it is the easy to use interface. Best idea ever.
"Just installed the app, will back to see if it works
I give 5 star because this app give a good user experience and free plan"
"I switched over to Seguno when Shopify and MailChimp parted ways. So far, I'm glad I found their service! I am especially grateful for the integration within Shopify. I don't have to have a separate account on another platform. I've had some newsletter questions and their customer support responds in a reasonable amount of time. The user interface is easy to navigate and manage. Now, all they need is a sign up pop up in the middle of the screen and we're good to go! Still definitely recommend!"
"Full featured, amazing review app! The review section matches the style of the product pages and looks great. The backend interface is easy to use, and the developers are super friendly and helpful. Our customers have been very responsive."
"Quick and easy, really easy to add to cart, easy interface very smooth"
It is best app for the feed submisson. It has easy interface and user friendly.
"i just installed the app, i hope it does as it says. but so far, nice interface and easy to set up."
"5 Stars! Awesome app so far! Extremely intuitive so that I was able to set up several emails and a newsletter in minutes. I had just one small question which was answered perfectly in minutes.  I am so happy that I moved to this app after needing a replacement for the other email app who is ending it's services with Shopify. Their interface was ridiculously inefficient and nothing seemed to have any kind of logical flow to it. Where it took me hours before to set up any semblance of a cohesive email system with them, it was so easy, quick and incredibly intuitive with Seguno that I am still awed that I got it done in a fraction of the time! Thanks so much Seguno! - glamupgear.com"
Excellent app. So easy to use with Shopify. Great interface and very simple instructions for setting up even on an iPhone!
I'm just happy to have an integrative platform to connect to my MailChimp. I don't have the time to change mail service and learn to navigate another interface.
Excellent app! Bit tricky to implement but once in a whole done everything works well. Revisions are really fantastic! Love integrating google surface interface.
"Just bought it. Excellent customer service, they installed it into my custom theme within minutes. The interface itself works easy, a kid can do it. Now I just need to see my Google rankings improve in the weeks to come."
"It is a must for every all commerces nowadays. Friendly interface when connected trough Shopify, haven't tried directly thru google."
SEO Meta Manager has helped my client get found online. In just a few short days we are getting found by search engines and reaching our customers. The easy to use interface is grat for even the novice and the customer support is amazing! We had some problems and the did some custom code to fix it within 24 hours. This is a great app!
"This is one of the best apps I've ever used! Amazing interface - exactly like Shopify, so super easy to adapt to. I thought email marketing was going to be hard, but this makes it a breeze! Thanks for making such a quality app :)."
"This app is AMAZING it has all the basics set up that a marketing email campaigns needs.
1. The interface is really friendly and easy to manage because it really do looks like you're in your Shopify theme editor.
2. Emails templates are simples and customizables as you want. 
3. When you need it can generate singles codes for each customers based your shop's codes set up.
I don't see any problem with this app and I'm really glad I found it ! Also the support team is quick and friendly.
Thank you Seguno !"
Very helpful. User friendly interface for email marketing. I would definitely recommend this app as it's more intuitive than others.
WOW. Just randomly pop up and thought of giving it a try.. Just loved it. The mobile app feature is so smooth and the interface is friendly.
very good. thank you for this amazing add on. Very easy to use and always work flawless. Amazing interface and many options.
"Super simple interface, love how convenient it is, the best part: IT'S FREE. I advise anyone who is trying to get larger conversion rates to give this a try!"
"Excellent features, you cannot beat the price.
Would recommend very user friendly interface!
Enhanced sales a huge amount."
This app is seriously amazing! The interface and options are so easy to use. It really gives my store the pop it needs!
"Great interface, I use it to get abandoned carts back and so far it has deemed pretty darn successful. Also free which is great."
"Great so far, working on styling and looking to see if the features will work just as fine. Good work, but could simplify the use interface in terms of arrangements so make it neater and easier to digest."
"I liked the app's interface so easy to navigate thru, I used it to take my products on the Google medias in order to get tractions and conversations."
"Awesome. Super simle, easy to use. Lov ethe interface. Also really enjoy having no upfront fees to pay."
"It's a very good app and the best part is it's free. A good job is done by the team. Just one suggestion, please make the interface better. I am getting a popup msg again and again about 24x7 chat. How to remove that?
Please give your customer support details"
"Honestly they need to improve their interface for settings, however once you are done with the settings the app does what it needs to do"
Its an amazing app. Easy to use and works well. I am able to boost sales on my store with minimal effort and I love the user-interface
Hey man! I hope you guys got my email and we can work something out. Your app is actually really good. The User interface makes it a lot easier for less tech savvy people. I hope we can work something out so you can help me with http://www.nusups.com
This app works exactly as it says it does. I enjoyed using the popup feature to offer a discount in exchange for a prospect's email address. It's also easy to work with because of the easy to use interface.
Nice review this app is all i need thanksyou. It was a nice interface easy to use and email marketing
"Funciona perfectamente, en cinco minutos lo tienes funcionando. Podría mejorar la interface, pero cumple con lo que dice."
Easy to understand and complete.  Clear info buttons for answering questions.  Very smooth interface with Shopify
the very very useful，This software can make my customers grow effectively，Whether in terms of user experience or functionality.
"Very easy to use if you want to boost sales! Great interface, simple and intuitive. Really recommended"
"This is a great app. Haven't finished/published my site yet, but I like the interface and flow to this app a lot!"
awesome app.  easy to use and customize even for beginners.  straightforward customization and user-friendly interface. recommend it!
the best app and easy interface. create of monster ..................................................
Excellent app. User friendly and easy interface! ..................................................
"Quick install, clean interface, and overall a great SEO Meta data management app for the search engines."
"Nice user interface & easy to set up! Helpful in achieving marketing goals, and recruit new customers."
It's an awesome app! I used it in my website and it works great. The interface is very easy to use..
"It is very difficult to edit from the Shopify panel. The interface is very complex. Hopefully it will be fixed as soon as possible. Otherwise, it seems impossible to use it. :/"
"Final Edit: Folks at Editorify reached out to me to look into the issues I listed below. Only a few hours after talking to me, the developers had already implemented a button in the settings to disable new customer reviews! Now that is customer service! Upgrading to 5-star, and hopefully our store will take off and I can upgrade to the premium version of this app.
Interface is a bit clunky, but does what it says and imports reviews from AliExpress. My biggest complaints are that it will not let me disable the ""leave a review"" button and will not let me re-order the reviews.
Edit: Developer replied and said leave a review can be disabled, but I do not have that option in accordance to his screenshot. Maybe it's a paid only feature? (currently evaluating the free plan)"
"It s been 2 month 15/24/7 we use Editorify.
This app is a KILLER APP, it helps to manage our 2.000 products from our website. It would have been a nightmare from the awful Shopify's interface.
You can change images, reorder it within minutes, change title quickly.
When you see you need to modify a price or a compare at price..5sec and its done.
This is the N1 in our Top Ten App without any doubt.
And the support team is always here in minutes when you need them.
No brainer app. a must have!!"
Just started using this app. Looks good and has a very easy interface! Can´t wait to start getting results!
It's user-friendly interface. I really like this. where you can sync shipping template is really good!
"Good application that helps me keep in touch with customers who visit my store, I still do not understand how the free abandoned carts work, I hope to understand soon and the interface is a little overloaded and it would be necessary to polish some things in my opinion, but for what It is a very good app, I recommend it."
"the app works fine, is pretty simple.
But the user interface in the Admin mode is terrible, not user friendly, the info is not structured, poor usability"
Seems really simplistic and solid interface.  The app get the job done for our needs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"So far so good. The user interface is easy to understand and works well.
Still waiting for my products to be approved so I cannot give a full review yet"
Good interface and easy to use. It shows all relevant search results. Plus different stores with prices you can compare.
Easy to use and set up. Simple and effective tool to enhance your user experience & retain customers. Trying out the push notifications currently. Excited to see what other features are rolled out...
Awesome! Great interface and user friendly. Great conversion too!
"Rien compris à l'utilisation, c'est moi ou l'interface surchargée qui n'est pas claire, mais je n'ai pas pu utiliser l'outil."
"It is great to have the ability to set up Google Ads directly through the Shopify store. The interface is simpler to use than Google's Merchant Center, and Shopify's support is far better. The one downside is that the app currently only allows one type of ad to be run and tracked from within Shopify."
"The interface of the app is user-friendly, you can let the app group the products together or you can manually select your own products to group together, this is easily done.  Easy to install. The customer service is truly amazing,  I requested they place the widget in a custom position. I expected to hear back in a day or two. They had my custom requested completed and functioning on my site within 10 mins. Very happy with the app. I highly recommend it."
So far so good. Easy to use with a very clean interface.
"So far so good, loving the interface, great interaction from users. Only thing would be to make the logo size customisable."
"Ate o momento esta se mostrando bem e cumprindo seu papel, a interface é um pouco confusa, tem muita informação flutuante poderia limpar mais."
"Just started using this, but from the looks of it, it will do exactly what we need. Great interface and lots of options to test!  Thanks!"
"Customisation options are very good, I can achieve my design and customer experience objectives easily. Interface is simple, saving takes a while to complete but otherwise everything works well."
"Span-a-sale has helped us generate 100's of email addresses that we are then able to email and generate income from that we would not have had the opportunity otherwise.
The easy to use interface also make span-a-sale really easy to use and is a positive way to generating more store income."
awesome that is free!! keep up the good work. Really good interface!
"The drag and drop interface makes it very intuitive to get up and running. There are a lot of options to consider, I prefer the high degree of customization possible. I liked the ability to integrate with custom generated promo codes, as well as the layers/steps possible, as well as the built-in Social media integration."
"Works well enough. The interface is a bit cumbersome, but after working with it for a bit it's easy enough."
"It's difficult to edit the chat box. Almost next to impossible. But interface is great and once connected well, it works like a breeze."
"Nice app, good interface, easy to use, a lot choices to choose from, fast shipping too. highly recommended"
"Nice app, good interface, easy to use, a lot choices to choose from, fast shipping too. highly recommended"
"It works very well BUT the interface is so ugly, convoluted and not practical! But it really works very well, at least for me! I am using this app on 3 different stores."
Very intuitive interface and advanced app. Great for up sells and cross sells.
good and easy to use. the interface makes it easy to change details of the promo.
Easy-to-use interface and very nice features!
Great platform for creating pop-ups! Easy to use interface and handsome-looking designs to choose from.
The app is really great for being free. Easy to understand interface and great pop up and bar options with nice effects and editing tools. Would recommend. Used in my store at  www.divinelotustemple.com
Interface to manage promotions is a bit janky. Can't delete test emails used in promos.
"It's good interfaces and provide best sfp to search my store,it helps me to run my business and my selling."
This Frequently Bought Together bringing a great user experience! Helps your Shopify website improve ROI. sleafjewel.com is using this App.
Nice and easy interface to configure. Too early to say if it really helps boosting sales
"After removing my last 1-star review, I am now forced to add another one in order to protect my interests. 
Back in August of 2017, Justuno finally resolved to stop charging my credit card, even though I had tried multiple times to cancel my account through their website. We parted ways amicably after they returned the misappropriated funds and I thought that was the end of it. Now, after reviewing my recent credit card statements, I see that they've repeatedly charged my credit card even after I had requested they cancel the account. Oh BTW, I just logged into the supposedly ""canceled"" Justuno account. Turns out it's still active. How did that happen? I would try 'cancelling' the account yet again through their online interface, but I don't expect that will work... as it did not work in the past. For all I know, the ""cancel account"" button is nothing but an inactive, dummy button meant to give you a false sense of security. Truth is, only they can cancel the account on their side (if and when they want to).
Overall, great app, however these guys are either incredibly incompetent, or worse... maliciously taking money from it's users, even after they've attempted to cancel their accounts. As a repeat offender, I would say it's more the latter than the former."
"Just starting using it, looks nice. I would like to test this button over several days. Nice user interface, many options."
Best pop-up interface I've used yet. Sleek and easy to implement.
"The app works as it is supposed to, it has plenty of great integrations and a good design interface. Can't complain."
"Great app. Simple interface, accurate and to the point. Had no second thoughts on what I wanted. 
Looking forward to future updates!!!"
"Just started using, but the setup interface is a bit messy. overall seems a good app. Looking forward to make the most of it"
"Very easy to use interface, incredible amount of options allowing full customization"
"interface was super easy to use, I did not have to code anything!"
"Simple to use, great interface. Works wonderfully - I really like this app. It has templates so you can get it done in a few steps and move on to other things. Can't beat that"
Great for free good interface and lots of options
"This app helps a lot in fulfilling customers inquiries. I am still exploring the app, I wonder is thr a way to setup template of Q&As. Although the interface kinda messy, but its good enough as free app for beginners."
"great apps. Love that they give these amazing features for free :)
easy to use although configuration interface can be improved"
"Love the functionality. The design interface is a little clunky and tough to get used to, but it does EVERYTHING I need it to do. YAY!"
Great flexibility and easy user interface. It makes building email list from your site simple also giving shoppers messages at the right time to close sales.
"Good interface to use, very efficient and seems to achieve great results."
"Would've liked to leave a review after using it instead of prior to opening my store.
Smooth interface so far."
Works well but the editing interface is a bit arduous.
"Was using privy before this and it was lacking the feature to only show popups to people that visit specific pages (such as a content popup for blog visitors, but a discount for cart exit intent), with JustUno I was able to do it.
The interface is a bit more complex, but that's a good thing as there's WAY more you can do with JustUno.
Only set up one promotion so far, but I'm loving it!"
"Awesome, easy to use interface and pre-built templates. Highly recommend."
Great interface. Able to make beautiful popups. Disappointed you don't integrate with Conversio.
"Great app that's massively increased sales, I'm very pleased. A great user experience. I highly recommend it."
Very fast support via chat function in the app. Very good translation quality and easy to use user interface.
Very nice and easy to use interface!
"nice app....can convert more visitors, loved the interface and colour options. Easy for customer. Looks proffessional too"
"this is the worst and most confusing app ever, please review your interface because anything is making sense."
"This app has helped us improve our conversion rate, which is wonderful. It has prompted many people who were going to leave to complete their order. We are very pleased with the interface and options!"
"Great interface, amazing app for being free"
"Love this App and the engagement with support.  This was extremely easy to set up and modify.  My only disappointment is that the main algorithm is based on past sales.  I was launching my store for the first time so I had to do a fair amount of force matching, but even then I found the interface extremely easy to use."
"This is a great app. Within an hour of installation it paid for itself with a sale that was directed by the recommendations. The support team is great! Questions are answered as soon as they are asked. The interface is mostly intuitive and when it is not the Support Team steps up. 
I recommend this app strongly for all Shopify stores."
"Update: After two weeks of live testing. Visitors droped 45%.... Sales droped over 50%. Some users from germany get the english version displayed and canceled the order. I have deleted the app. Old Rating: Easy Interface, Good Design and a smooth auto translation. You can also add manual translation after. Perfect & a very helpful team which guides you thru all the setup. Thank you."
"Justuno is a great app with a very good interface, but I've been most impressed with the support I've received from Yuno."
"Really easy design interface with tons of templates to quickly get you started.  The only aspect that took me a bit of time to figure out was programming the coupons, but other than that it's a simple yet powerful app."
"Amazing app. super fast.
Simple and intuitive interface. I recommend.
Ps. A special thanks to Molly for all the help."
"Update 12/5/2019: Shopify support reached out to me directly after I posted this review. They did a complimentary review of my setup and let me know that everything was set correctly on my end. They said it takes 14 full days for Google to ""learn"" your products and to figure out the best placement for conversions. Seeing no activity during this period is normal. 
We are now 21 days into the campaign and we're starting to see activity from it (sessions, adds to cart, etc). It appears that it was working correctly this whole time which really goes to emphasise the importance of improving the user interface. I made a few suggestions to the support that reached out to me and he said he would pass them on to the developers. I really hope they do because this is a valuable marketing channel and could be a great tool if it were more user friendly. 
For example, there is nothing telling the user that this learning period is underway. It just says ""active"" and ""running"" which is not accurate. Adding to the frustration is the fact that you have to dedicate a portion of your marketing budget to it- In my case $5/day (or $150/mo) which is not a small amount. 
I am updating this review from 1 star to 3 stars because it does work.. The user interface is just severely lacking. 
Original review:
I really hate leaving negative reviews but I think this app needs to be completely overhauled. I fumbled through the setup and after some trial and error got most of my products to get accepted by google (48 out of 51). After this, I tried setting up a paid campaign with a starting budget of $5 a day. The campaign has been ""active"" and apparently running since November 14th and in these 7 days, there has been zero activity and I'm honestly not even sure if they're actually running. I have had really good success on Google adwords campaigns as well as Facebook campaigns but really zero activity in 7 days? It seems like something is wrong with the campaign but there is no way for me to diagnose it inside the app. Everything just says active, accepted, and running. This app lacks intuitiveness and navigating through the setup and maintenance is very cumbersome. Most of these positive reviews look fake if you read through them, so I'm not sure if the developers even care to improve it. Sad because this would be a great marketing tool if it worked!"
"So far, so good! I actually just downloaded so I don't really have an opinion about using the app. The interface so far is excellent!"
Easy to use and great interface for correcting errors and resubmitting data.  Also fast response in validating products.
The team at Code Black Belt was speedy and helpful when customizing the look and placement of the product recommendation section on our product pages. They were knowledgeable and thoughtful when implementing our requests taking the time to explain how our desired change would affect mobile users and suggesting a better option to provide the best user experience.
User interface is simple and effective
Amazing app! Set up a 10% off after 10 seconds on home page and over 100 people signed up within a week. Very easy and well thought out interface! Recommend highly!!
"acho que é um aplicativo bem completo e gratuito.
Acabei de instalar, o problema é o interface muito poluido."
Easy to use interface with very clean designs! Definitely a good app!
"We've used many lead capture apps and nothing compares to Justuno. It's a robust app with very useful features and templates. The interface is very intuitive and easy to use, the support is out of this world too. Absolutely recommended for any serious marketer."
quite useful but the design dashboard interface could use a little more work. It was really buggy for me and i had to restart many times. Does the job thou and its free so i aint complaining
"Easy to use, good interface and useful analytics plug in"
J'ai utilisé cette application afin d' étendre ma boutique dans le monde entier l'interfaces est très pratique à utiliser et l'assistance est au top merci Richcarde !
"it was an easy user experience, i recommend for new users to try it out. The options are varied, good experience"
"i love the interface, and the free mode had many options. Super cool!
Love for everyone yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Cool features and great interface, very easy to navigate and create"
"i am just installing the app i hope it will help me generate more profit thank you, the interface looks well"
"Give them a try, So far so good! Great interface, easy to setup, and works just fine by now, recommended,"
"Easy interface, fast and efficient technical support, fully recommended. one of the apps that I use the most in my ecommerce business"
"great user experience and customer support, great for internaciona business and good for customer service"
A completely useless app. Keep prompting to update my list of products and I have more than a thousand SKUs! All I need is a easy to use interface that can syn to my store..I do not want to waste time editing all my products just so it reads your language!
"Really helps in delivering quick and important messages to our users through easily customized pop-ups. Love the fluidity of the interface and robustness of the app. Would surely recommend to all! Use it, you will love it!"
It's great. Love the interface. Whatsapp is a really great place to advertise and it's amazing to have this.
Great Interface. Zero Problems so far
"Incredible design interface, plenty of choice and infinite possibilities to increase sales!"
"OK, the ""bad"" stuff first...  
1. Whoever writes this app does not know the difference between ""then"" and ""than"".  Pet peeve of mine, but doesn't affect the way the app functions.
2. Unless you wire a sensor to your customers' brains, there is NO WAY to fully capture mobile exit intent.  Cannot be done.  Sorry.  
Now, the Good stuff...
3. See #2 above - BUT, this app is the best at coming close.  They can pop up an exit intent offer when mobile users hit the ""back"" button out of your site, and that's 100% better than nothing, and 99.9% better than any other app on the market!!
4. Along with #3, the ability to create different offers for Desktop, Tablet & Mobile is HUGE.  I know a lot of apps say they automatically adjust, but that doesn't come close to having independent control over what is displayed on each platform.  
5. EXCELLENT design interface!!  You can, quite literally, create any kind of offer or message to your shoppers.  Colors, styles, placement, unique coupon codes, background images...  If you can think it up, you can create it in this app.
6. Responsive and relevant support.  Some developers give you quick answers, some give you correct answers.  These guys actually give you HELP in a timely and useful manner.  
7. FREE for everything I need so far.  When my store gets to the point where the free version won't keep up, I will GLADLY upgrade."
"Such a great App! Does exactly what its supposed to do, extremely easy to use interface and setting up takes no time at all.
Keep up the great work!"
"Love this app, along with all the features and easy user experience."
"Not test it yet, but app looks GREAT !!! It gives a real Amazon feel and high level of security. Support is amazing! I was installing app late in the evening and leave it to configure in the morning. Tomorrow when I look it up again, I saw that support already send me an email to told me that they configured app for me and to ask me do I like it and do I have to change anything else!?! Freakin' unbelievable !!! I have never ever had that kind of user experience ! Well done guys , keep goin' !"
"it is nice, the interface looks good, maybe i will upgrade soon for automatic translation, it may work well on my website"
User Interface is SO easy!  This App does exactly what I was wanting from an Upsell App...Manual Recommendations!  I will be
"100% Recommended! I love how fast and effortless this app allows you to integrate a translation into your shop. For me, the user interface and sleek design makes it easy to work and manage everything form your content to your language switcher. Had a small issue at the beginning, but Lisa and the support staff where right on it! Top notch service! Thank you for the assistance..."
great app and service with easy to use interface. very intuitive and helpful. highly recommend to all shop owners
"This application has been the most frustrating experience I've ever had. You're much better off with a manual feed. Products take 15+ days to approve, the interface is terrible, not very compatible with merchant center (products show pending in shopify but not in merchant center) and the best part is that neither google or shopify have any insight on how to resolve any errors that come up. After two months of trying, I deleted this app. Save yourself the time and don't use this."
Incredibly basic. Learn to use the Googles Ads interface or hire someone. It's amazing that this is the best that Shopify can provide.
Easy to implement; nice customization interface; and I've already added to my email marketing list. Nice.
"Like it OK so far, but have more to learn.  One ""annoying"" issue is that it keeps sticking out and you have to close it or it covers part of our store.  If there's a way to stop that I haven't found it yet.  In fact, I just turned it off because it was causing a negative user experience.  www.watchfreedomfighters.com"
"Overall very impressed with Justuno. Very clean, easy to use interface, set up took less than five minutes and the free for life program they offer is great for start-ups and to test out the app. I will be recommending this app to anyone that is looking to increase their traffic through social media."
This application is very easy to use. It is very easy to set up bundles for recommended products. Back end functionality provides an excellent user experience. CodeBlackBelt team provides an excellent customer service! They responded literally in 5 minutes and did a relocation of the app in 10min. I would highly recommend Frequently Bought Together App.
"Pretty terrible. Bad UI, complicated where it shouldn't be(the interface, getting around, setting things up) and not complex enough where it should be ( sale settings, options, product management)"
Great app with efficient and helpful service. We used a customized shopify theme. The technology team even help us design the interface of our website. We will use their advanced function.
I have started using it today because I feel I'm losing sales in international countries. So far both the app interface and costumer service are amazing!
"Very pleased with this app. I needed to overhaul my site after four years on Shopify and wanted to add the ability to show other products that compliment my main offerings. I researched three different apps and FBT appeared to by the best suited for my needs. My site overhaul is to make sure every part of my site is ""mobile first"" and to simplify the navigation and remove products that are not performing well. Adding the extra element of a ""you might also like"" app would have only been possible if the app is easy to learn and use and also if it had excellent support. All my expectations on these items were exceeded. I was able to get it up and running and used it on a sale 24 hours later. It was a major success and we saw thousands of dollars in orders right away from people adding items to their cart using the app. Every app should work this good and have such good support. I bought the annual subscription just now. 
Here is some brief advice on making sure you have success with this app.
If your goal is to be mobile first and have a good uniform and organized layout of add-on products you will need to have simple, short and uniform lengths for the titles of the products you plan to feature using the app. You also want to avoid having more than two options for variants, and avoid using ""yes"" or ""no"" answers for your variants otherwise you will get drop down boxes that do not have enough info for a visitor to make their add on purchase. 
For my site I made my own rules to follow. Something like titles all being exactly 25 or 26 characters (for uniform appearance of layout) Variants in total not to exceed 35 characters (to optimize the scroll wheel on iPhone) These are not exact numbers but meant to give you an idea of the things you will want to have figured out if your goal is to optimize the app similar to how I am using it on my site. If you plan to use the app for all it can do and you want to make the user experience as optimized as possible I would say that a Shopify admin with average skills should set a full day or two aside to learn and implement the app, just be aware that like me, you will most likely find other changes that you will want to make to your listings and your site during that time so give yourself extra time on the calendar to really get the most out of it. If you just want to get something up on your site fast then this will also work for you and you can literally do it in minutes, my day or two of time suggestion is if you want to get it as dialed-in as possible (and assuming you have a mess of a site after four years of learning how Shopify works.. like I did before the overhaul started) 
By the way their support is the fast I have ever seen with any company in 17 years I have been in business... Well done team CodeBlackBelt!
Apologies for my spelling and grammar."
"It's really good as never before, the interface is clearly visible, the Settings are clear, and it's a must for communicating with customers. It's really great"
"Support is awesome, helping me walk through setting, application is easy to use, interface is nice and clean, love it!"
"The interface is really handy, we had some technical issues but customer service was very responsive and helpful."
"Easy and useful app..I never done a Sales Boost but with this application, it make my life easier than ever. Interface and instruction is easy to follow."
"Nice user interface.
Lot of options. One of the few to support Image Translation.
Really good customer service!"
"interface looks pretty good. was unable to pick the language i wanted to translate to(ok now). there are many options for me to use, seems like it is well liked by other store owners."
"Great support and follow up by Jane. The app interface is easy navigate and set up
Overall experiences is Great"
Ok. Let's see if it's work. Interface is prety easy
"Re-Rating. Tried numerous similar apps. This app have one of the nicest interface and features for customisation you can't get with others. Adding to the recent purchase notifications, I would definitely look forward to the shopify review notifications as well. Lastly, Yopify support was great and helpful.
Great app! Good job team! I will hang around this paid app for awhile. =)"
"The app is wonderful, the support is amazing and reliable.
The interface is very clean and intuitive, you can translate your page and display the currency exchange rate in minutes!"
Great customer service and Super frendly use interface as well as amazing functions. The dev is our best support.
"Great Unser interface and prices, an alpha app for dropshippers.I have been searching long for such a service which ends here. Thanks, you eprolo for such a solution for automating my dropshipping process."
"I have never reviewed an app before, but this app forced me to do it!
Amazing interface and easy to use & great support team, they helped me many times!
Big shout out to the developers who developed this App and everyone on the team!"
"Extremely impressed with this app. The interface is very thorough in terms of the configuration options, and yet it is also extremely user-friendly."
So far so good - still testing on the app. Some part of the graphic interface can be further improve.
"Great app, really easy to use interface and the translations took a few hours. Was able to translate page and currency really well."
"Just started using it and seems to work pretty well! Quick and easy to install, with a user friendly interface"
Excellent app! extraoprdinary interface and good funcionallity its very useful and quicly setup and better than all its free!!
This app really does what it says and for free. Amazing interface and very easy to use. Only down is that it works as an extension.
"The customer support for Transcy is very good, always aiding in solving tech issues in a few days. Regarding the interface of the app, it is slightly slow to translate and there may be some issues that arise. However the staff will be there to aid in solving them as mentioned."
Very good APP and its free. Great and easy interface. Its a great alternative for those looking for a free app.
"So far so good! It was super easy to use, has a slick interface and integrated with our shop automatically. Awesome."
Since the most recent change you cannot edit translations on the free plan. On top of that the edition interface is extremely slow and inconvenient to use.
It has a very easy interface and the app works very well. Integration with Shopify makes it super easy.
Works well. Design interface for owners could be nicer but it works well and implemented it in just a couple of mins.
"Excellent app, accurate translations, fast customer support and friendly user interface. Highly recommended!"
"When it comes to images, there is likely more than meets the eye.  Often overlooked and underestimated, images on the web have been getting more attention lately and their importance is growing for a variety of reasons ranging from purely supporting user experience and content to enabling users to visually find more products directly from image search itself."
Simple and intuitive interface. We received quick and efficient assistance from the app support team.
"Me gusta la interface, espero que funcione bien tengo todas las espectativas puestas en ello, gracias"
This is the kind of app that simplifies the user experience. Very important if they typically buy a basket of products.
"The interface is very simple. The setting is more user-friendly. I compared several translation apps of shopify. It is the most convenient to operate. But its highest price package is also the most expensive. If you do the market in many countries, it is very suitable. Overall, this is an excellent service, thank you."
"Super simple and easy! Does all the hard work for you and the interface is easy to understand, Love this app!"
"I like the interface of the currency switcher, more sleek than the one i was using. However, it seems like this app slowed down my site from 36 to 13. Luckily i backed up my theme and i load them back to get to 36.
But when i reinstalled this app, it dropped down to 19 again and still dropping... So CS team, don't try to throw the ball back to me saying other apps is affecting, cos clearly it isn't true. i haven't changed anything for months, and the slowness only happens after i installed your app. So you are the culprit, no one else.
And i am good now with another app, my speed now is maintaining at 40. good enough for me. So stop bugging me, thanks."
A great app with a simple interface and powerful functions. There is also a very good customer service. I am very satisfied.
"Great app so far. I like the interface a lot, has good overview. Also the costumer support is super and very helpful. highly recommended!"
"We are just now getting it up and running, but so far so good! The price is right and the interface is super easy to use. It just takes a few minutes to get it set up."
"The interface took me a while to get used to, but once I did, I was in awe. Transcy is excellent and chat support (with real people, not bots) responds in a timely manner with extreme kindness and professionalism. I'm extremely satisfied, especially since I'm using a free plan! I will definitely use it for other sites in the future and recommend it to everyone."
"This application has made my job very easy, the interface of the application is very simple and useful, the employees are friendly and very helpful.
So I am satisfied..."
This is the best translator and currency converter I've used. It is very easy to setup and its admin panel and interface very easy to use. It has all features you may expect form a translator and converter.
"the currency converter work well and pack of functionalities(free!), great user interface, good support, just 1 issue, if you use PureVpn, it display CNY currency for Taiwan(this is a non issue for other converter app), not sure about other VPN, hope they can fix it edit: I dont think my vpn has issue (because it work well for other converter and google able to recognize it as Taiwan) but I decided to use another vpn to save time troubleshooting"
"Great app! Love the interface and very easy to use. Customer service is really helpful. Thank you, Alex!"
"Love the interface, great price and i needed the developer to help me add in the filters and Nikita was quick to respond (on a weekend) and helped me with it promptly. Looking forward to more development on this app. Good work!"
"First of all, the customer support is just fantastic and first class. I had requested multiple customizations to the search bar and they were prompt to comply with wonderful results! 
The search bar itself is a must have for any website. Great functionality and will differently create a great user experience for your customers! 
Don't look for any others, I have tried them. This is the winner by miles :)
Thanks CloudSearch team!"
Exactly what I've been looking for. Great interface and very simple to operate! Click click and done. Thank you.
Quick and easy setup! Loved how the interface is a no brainer and how fast it works. Hopefully will see the increase of traffic in my shop.
"Used this app, works well till now. We need to test it for the next few days for exact results. The interface is very simple to use and user-friendly."
very good plugin free plan in one website. fast installation and simple user interface for best comunication
"Amazing. Juste amazing. Une application qui tient la route, avec une interface minimaliste mais efficace. Je la recommande, et 5 étoiles c'est peu cher pour le temps gagné !"
"The fine program, intuitively clear interface and very fast and qualified support.
Nothing was necessary to do to me, they contacted me and as soon as I gave access to the shop, set everything.
They are the best, and I will not spend time for search of other programs."
"Great app! Great support! It does what it states, the interface is very simple to use. You also get a preview of how the post will look, which is a nice bonus. The app automates some of the boring work you have to do."
"It is a great app allowing us to have different currencies (at automated exchange rates), user-friendly interface and very good customer support that solves all our problems asap. Only reason we are not giving 5 stars is the speed of the interface, which takes long to load causing obvious delays and, even worse sometimes, saved translations are not properly saved."
"This is a great app that shows relevant results AND it looks great! We were using another app with a complicated interface that kept changing their plans and stripping back features. CloudSearch is nice and simple, looks great and it works!"
"My experience with Teelaunch has been great!  I wish they offered more products, but what they do offer is priced very competitively and their interface is extremely easy to use."
"I've been enjoying this app in a BIG WAY. The interface is easy, well-designed, and fun to use! Customer service responded within a day, and answered my question in full. The product offerings are better than all the other on-demand print production apps that I've seen, with competitive prices. Just made my first order, so I'll find out about quality when it arrives, but so far I'm a huge fan and look forward to making more things!
Highly recommend."
App needs a little user experience help. Some things don't come intuitively but I am sure there are ways to do it.
"It does not even support bulk importing from any of the mentioned sites.
If you have a large number of products do not try to install this app. I installed this app and charged my account immediately and they told me to upgrade for Unlimited Plan to bulk import from just 1 supported site (That too doesn't work). If you are a new business don't waste your money on this app, there are tons of free app available which does the same thing. Also, the user experience is so poor, I definitely don't recommend this app. STAY AWAY!"
"Pros - 
Easy interface, the app itself is easy to use and design products.
The app works well with Shopify.
Pricing is competitive. 
Cons - 
I have contacted customer service several times with various response times, everywhere from never responding to 2 days. Slow either way. Once I was in correspondence with someone from customer service replied to my response by the next business day.
Information?!? There is a lack of information and organization. I want to know what brands and variants are available for which products and how much shipping is for each item. There is no reference page for this information.  
For example I ordered a sample of the District Long Sleeve Tee and got a Port and Company instead. The response from Customer services was that purple is only offered in Port and Company and not District. Except that the product says it will be a District shirt. I need to know what I am getting not be surprised.
It seems that the products listed for sale in the App are not exactly what you will be getting. 
They add new products to the app without much product description. Once again lack of information. A product description or how much to ship.
The provided sizing guide leaves a lot to be desired. 
Based on some emails from the owner, it seems they are working hard on updates and making the app better. It has lots of potential as the design of the app is great. 
Once the get a little more organized I might try them again."
"The interface is more sensible than other similar products. They are very friendly, willing to help, and respond quickly, we look forward to more features in the future."
"Ryviu is a great app with a rather user-friendly interface what makes it really easy to navigate through. It has all necessary features to make your store reviews look professional and neat. Moreover, this guys have an awesome 5- star customer support, always ready to address your burning questions. I would definitely recommend this app!"
Great experience so far. Cant wait to see how much it helps my store. I Absolutely love the user friendly interface and dashboard
I used this app to collect customer reviews for products on our website and via email after the purchases. It’s amazing app with great support team. The review section interface on our site looks professional and reliable. Happy with it. Definitely recommend this app for who need to collect customer reviews
"Very bad user navigation, I get a lot problems with my store translation. The user interface don't scrolling down its very lag. I want to cancel my subscription but i don't see in any where to cancel, it this is another fall.I uninstall my app, but the company charge my the middle plan price ($17.90). When I reinstall my app to see if its work better, the app say that I need to pay the same tariff again. I WANT MY MONEY BACK !!!!!!"
"EXCELLENT APP! We are a flower shop. We've been on their previous version ""Data Export APP"" before moving to Report Pundit and it was already great! That app did everything we needed, but the interface was a bit old school. This is a definite enhancement for a marginal price. Much more flexible and intuitive to use, but still the same amazing instant customization service through a chat window. We are a flower shop and are using it on daily basis to run daily order reports for florists, delivery company and and create shipping labels and card notes for the products! We also use it to create monthly revenue reports and analyze our clientele."
"The app is very easy to use, basically it has all the necessary functions, it runs fast, and has a friendly interface. The customer service staff are very professional and conscientious. Not only can they solve the problem, they also help me with tuning, which is highly recommended!"
"Customer service is not as claimed ""24/7"". The person that was appointed to us was not very professional when communicating with clients (e.g. We were requested to delete a review that they did not like after they have requested us to write one) The app has a lot of bugs and flaws when translating the website (There were many instances where we had to address the issues with the technical support team and they had to fix it ""Manually""). On several occasions, There were requested changes claimed to be ""impossible"" to be done. The User interface is not friendly at all when editing translations (good luck in finding the word needed to be edited when the search bar is not working)"
"Currently have a month experience using this app, so far so good. I am a quadrilingual speaker, so I can translate them pretty much everything by myself. Pros: - Their customer support is always online even on holiday (1/1/2021), which is very impressive. They fixed my difficult problem in just few hours (I was expecting couple days due to off business days). - Great interface! The most unique feature is that one single button can allow customer choose both languages and currency. Cons:
- I wish their app and interface can load little bit faster haha. I am kind of impatient person.
- Hopefully have more currency available. They are currently don't have NTD, which is for Taiwan.
- Your website will be look nicer if you know a bit on HTML code to customize the font in their app. Otherwise, you can just use their default font style."
"Great App! I rely on this all too often to get data out of Shopify. Flexible, easy to use interface, makes it essential for ongoing fast data extracts. Good job!"
"I think this is a must-have app for every store owner. The 'Add To Cart' button is always visible for the user, and it really improves the conversion rate! 
The support team is also awesome. They responded very quickly to everything I need. I ask them if it possible to customize something on my site, and they love the concept and added it to the interface of the app! very recommended!"
"We are still in the trial period, but as a data analyst, this report app is spot on.
Helpful support and tonnes of data segments to pull into as many reports as you want. 
We have 10 domains that we will be rolling into the same app account in order to see all purchase data in one single report.
Very useful and perfect for marketing and financial reporting. The best I have seen for an excellent price. User interface is very simple too."
"Allowing customers to browse through your content in their own language
(both methaphorically and literally) is essential for the process of creating a relationship with your customers, which is a Must every respective store!
And so far I haven't seen a better way to do this than with ""Transcy""!
The interface is ingenious! Their customer support is on point*
*I contacted them at 11pm and they got to me in minutes.
10/10."
Very powerful app. Report Pundit accomplishes the same thing that other reporting apps do for less cost and with a more user-friendly interface. Staff is very responsive and happy to assist setting up custom reports. We are very happy with Report Pundit and have installed it on multiple stores.
"It works. But the interface is not that intuitive, and you can easily overwrite your first free 100,000 words and then have to spend more to re-translate your store."
"Like the App's clean and organized interface. Once you get used it, you like the way it handles import and displaying reviews. The support team is absolutely one of the best: responsive, effective and friendly professional. With a few issues at the beginning, they were able to quickly help you solve them. Was trying it to see how it works. Now it's clear I would like to stick with it after a couple days of using it. Highly recommend!"
"Excellent app !
Straightforward install and configuration, intuitive interface.
Support answers in minutes.
To us simply the best solution to run a multilingual Shopify store !"
"NO UNINSTALL FEATURE. Installer beware.
I found other apps to be better... but that's not the core reason behind 1-Star, the core reason is this: Ryviu installs inself into your Shopify with no true uninstall option. Sure, you can delete it, but enjoy having their buttons and nonsense in your back-end product viewer FOREVER (like within your shopify interface). I messaged them asking for how to remove it; no response. Every other app Ive installed has easy uninstall options (where needed) or fast customer service. Update: it was a Ryviu chrome extension that came with the App (?) causing this on the shopify side of things. Interestingly, it was never active, but requesting access-- yet still causing this mischief. So to uninstall: You need to go into about 5 different pages (Theme pages, Product pages) search Ryviu, delete them. Then make sure that the extension (which I'm guessing installs on its own and then runs on its own without being approved) is then deleted too. Yuck. Better still, don't install this in the first place."
I definitely like the app. Quick and professional help from the support team. Cosy interface and smooth work. Exactly what I needed.
"Very Useful app. Must have for any shopify store. It has many ready to use reports. You can also create your own reports from thier easy to use interface.
Found this app very easy to use and gives the report instantly."
"Excellent,  I have used this app for Image SEO and its Done. Hassle free installation and user experience. The Alt Tags are setup automatically."
"This is an extremely useful and well put together app! The user experience is excellent, and the support staff is incredibly helpful. I highly recommend this app if you have reporting needs that the basic Shopify reports are unable to fill."
"Very professional, very easy to use, instant customer service，It's highly recommended to use, comments can upload pictures, user experience good"
"The Wishlist plus app has a very simple and user-friendly configuration interface.
Its eye catching dashboard provides meaningful customer activity metrics and effectively illustrates the value addition of this app to the store business.
I was provided tremendous and swift technical support when I requested for customized location of the Wishlist button on my Shopify store. On my further request, their dedicated technical team tweaked the theme further to fine tune the location of Wishlist button on Samsung Galaxy S7 smartphone.
I am extremely grateful and indebted to their technical team member, Nisha for actively pursuing my customization query and persistently seeking my opinions during the customization process"
"I just downloaded the app after trying a f ew other apps. This one was very straight forward and has a great user interface,"
"I wanted to receive a link for the ""Write a review"" interface that I can incorporate in an email. After waiting for 1 week for an answer from support, was told it is not possible - really? It looks like an easy task for me. Why such lack of cooperation? Also, the emails you can set up in the app to ask for a review do not include unsubscribe link. Bad service."
"Easy and quick setup. Love the in-app interface I don't have to login on another site, i can manage from my shopify admin front. So far so good. 
Update - one week in. it's awesome. just needs a marketplace and it'll be perf."
"The user interface is good. I have over a hundred images alt text to enhance so if this works, I'll be super chuffed."
Super Useful. They have a clean interface and an in-depth tutorial. Will recommend to people staring out.
"I really like this app, it's simple and really affordable, their support is great too!   
The interface could be more user friendly but their staff really helps out!"
Very Nice App.  Nice Interface and easy to use.
"I am so happy that I found this APP after using another expensive APP that cost me over$400+ and was a waste of money. This APP was super easy to install and looks so professional. I am very pleased with the interface as well.  I am starting out with the FREE version and then hopefully, I can move up soon. So glad that I have this option."
"Easy set up, great interface, very user friendly. Great if you need an affiliate program baked into shopify."
"I used this app to help me build the interface of the website. It is easy to use, and the support is fast."
Prefect app to import product review from aliexpress! Simple and easy user interface. Love it. thumbs up!
"Looks too good for me,,,, I love it. It does what it says. The interface is pretty simple and effective"
This app fits exactly what I have been looking for. The interface is so smooth and the customer service is amazing!
"LayoutHub is great because they offer great customer support, they count with a super user-friendly and intuitive interface, and they offer a great pricing plan for all needs. Highly recommend it."
"We have a very different experience to some other recent reviewers. App works perfectly on our site and the support is exceptional. They made a tweak for us immediately, and over a weekend, to change to some generic wording to the British English spelling from the apps US spelling.
Bells and whistles, multiple screen positioning options, etc. would be great and I am sure will come as the app matures. But don't be put off by this, the app works well, they address support queries quickly, and most of all, the app delivers exceptional value in the user experience that helps with customer attraction & sales."
"Great that it's free, very simple interface and looking forward to seeing the results! Hopefully they're positive"
"I loved the great interface, it was clear intuitive and the app is easy to settle ! Very useful, i really recommend it, i haven't upgraded yet but i surely will when i will see the impact of it."
"It was really easy to set up, especially for a beginner.  I just had to follow the instructions step by step. The interface is really nicely structured and user friendly, I am sure my affiliates will have a very nice user experience.
Thank you, the app is amazing!"
"I’m very impressed with the app’s sleek interface, customization options (even with the free version), and ease of use. I reached out with a few questions regarding customization and received a clear response in just a few hours! I’m looking forward to growing our referral program with it!"
"The user interface is easy, the templates are sleek and beautiful (although limited in number) and the support is fantastic. I asked them to change their features' color to match my brand and they did it surprisingly promptly!! The app only needs more templates to play around with, otherwise it's pretty good."
What a great app. Easy to install and set up. Very clean interface. Someone put some time into building these apps because they do exactly what you want them to and are easy to use!
i used this app and it optimises your seo with an easy interface to use. I extremely recommend this app
"Easy app to use, nice interface and easily integrates with website! :)"
"This app has been GREAT so far.  Very easy to understand and to use.  It helps me keep track of all of my clients purchases and points earned the way that I want it to.  The awesome customization options and clean look put the cherry on top.
The only thing I would recommend changing in the app is enabling more options for editing points balance(ability to remove points adjustments, etc.) in the user interface.
I would definitely recommend this to anyone trying to encourage customer loyalty on any scale.
Adam McCants"
A seamless set up process. It took me no more than 10 minutes to have everything up and running. So far it has been a great User experience. I’m on the free plan and it looks to be the real deal.
"This app is good if you are a beginner to Shopify and you want to make a decent looking website. There is not a lot of customization you can do with the individual sections they give you without paying, but overall user experience is good and I really like the customer service that comes with their chat-room."
"Excellent App, easy to install and set up, very intuitive interface to work with, great job! Pixellogo.com"
"Just test driving it so far but seems to be an amazing app. Nice clear easy interface, easy sign up. Great control over the shop. If my mind changes I'll be back up update."
Still looking into all of the features but so far probably one of the best user interfaces i have come across and super easy to use and set up!
"User-friendly interface with step-by-step video demonstrations on how to add, modify or remove; campaigns, coupons, rewards and more combined with simple and easy formatting and customizable options that helped me match the look and feel for my store to increase brand recognition, drive sales, along with loyalty and satisfaction. I will never settle for simply offering free shipping or monthly discounts again thanks to Swell Rewards. This platform empowers my customers to earn as they shop with a selection of redemption options to tailor their own unique shopping experience and even increase their earning potential by sharing with their friends, family or those in their community about our amazing products.

"Very good app that, is very transparent and has a very good user interface.
We want the team to continue developing the tool bcs it is very good."
i have never expected that such kind of apps can be so easy to install and simplistic interface makes it all. Thank you for your app! Looking forward for updates
trying this app out. Set up was very easy and they have a nice interface for the affiliates page. so far so good.
WE RECOMMEND THIS APP -> Just installed LAYOUT HUB to use as indexed pages for our blog - to help allow us to create seperate sections - interface UX is easy to navigate & the app does EVERYTHING i needed - i even had some customisation requirements which were sorted by customer service IMMEDIATELY - amazing! thank you Dilys & Layout hub team
"Of the several translation apps I tried Translation Lab had the most straight forward and visually pleasing interface. Manual translation option did the job on my site perfectly. The only issue I had was of my own making, the guys in Support helped me fix it within minutes. Great app, great service, definitely recommend!"
Brilliant app - we've used other apps in the past (like Reffersion) and this is heads and shoulders above the rest. Support is instant (about 2 minutes for a response) and the interface for affiliates is super slick. Very happy 10/10.
"They have a good inicial step by step tutorial;
Have an easy and usefull interface;
 Have an excelente and responding suport.
I’m going happy in my experience whit this app"
"I highly recommend LaoutHub for their easy to use interface and well-designed templates. Also, I needed help with two minor issues and the support team was responsive and efficient. I have tried several other page builder apps and nothing compares to LayouHub."
"I am really pleasantly surprised at how much this app helped me! 
Their interface is super easy to use, even for someone slowly learning to build their website. No need too add into the code which is a awesome!
The support offered is super reliable, and the awesome part is they have a live chat right on the dashboard, which comes in super handy, I had a few issues and they helped me out with a minimum wait time. 
This app is super recommended! 
The only thing I was looking for that could be added is some layouts  for totally independent galleries. (not linked to products or blogs)"
"This app is great, I can't believe it's free! The support and SEO advice I've received has been great, responses are so prompt, and it's got a really user friendly interface too. Definetley recommend!"
"We recently used Weglot and Langify in other stores, we wanted more control over what we translate. The interface is very easy to use, the actually is very easy to set up. This will be for sure our number one choice, especially for RTL languages."
"I just installed this app this morning.  I'm trying to get started with affiliates with just a couple key products. I didn't want to spend a ton and sign up for a service as I don't really know how successful I will be with affiliates.  So I am giving this a try. So far, installing was a breeze! Simple, easy to use interface. Very clear instructions on how to do it all. Had a couple hiccups at first with not all products loading but Anuj fixed that right away and expanded capacity of the app. Support has been awesome so far and very responsive.  Really the interface is so simple and that is appealing. You can even upload your logo or marketing materials for your affiliates to use! I haven't any affiliates sign up yet, so I'm not able to report out on how the backend is going to work. I'll report back after using this a while longer. But it appears very straight forward. Hurray for a simple, easy to use, (and free) affiliate app! Thank you!"
"Perfect! Exactly what I was looking for, simple interface and full control over every label and the store"
Great app! Highly recommend it! It's easy to use and has a nice looking interface. One of the better ones I have used for sure.
Super easy interface. Works well during my test. Waiting for customers to test--thank you for such a streamlined app!
not much help and isn't working for us well. please search for others before using this app. The interface of the app not friendly.
"Excellent app! 
As a professional marketer, this app is super-simple for the user experience (and for you, store owner), to create and manage bundles, discounts, deals, and whatever else regarding upsells!"
"I wanted to capture visitors' contact information by offering incentives, so I was looking for an app to facilitate it. Swell does that and more. You can set up an entire loyalty program. It has a user-friendly interface and is easy to set up. When I had questions, Josh and Amanda were very quick to respond. 
I added a newsletter sign-up pop-up and received first registrations right away. A loyalty program will be next. 
Overall, it's a great app!

"Kenna and the Kudobuzz have created a truly wonderful app! It has helped us collect and display reviews on our products and added to the user experience on our site as a whole. All that and EASY TO USE! Honestly it does not take any skill to set this up. We should know. We had an issue this week where another app left some code after being uninstalled and that code prevented Kudobuzz from loading. I reached out to the Kudobuzz team and they we're able to go in to our site, isolate the rogue code, and fix it!!! Now we are back to running smoothly and we couldn't be happier. 
Thanks guys!!"
"Had an issue where our team accidentally signed up twice which delivered duplicates. Kena from Kudobuzz was super-responsive and fixed the problem in minutes! 
When it comes to the app, we have found it very helpful to have a user interface that allows us to submit reviews we collected at tradeshows and upload pictures of the individuals. Also, the link to social media is great!"
"Kudos to Kena and team!
I am in a process of moving from YOTPO to Kudobuzz. While it's in their best interest to help me move from their competition, but I must say they have gone leaps and bounds beyond my expectations on supporting my migration.
The application loads up really fast and provides a great interface via widget or on a dedicated reviews page, explicit ask or mass review request.
I loved their SEO friendly product reviews. 
I'm also excited to see their application's integration with G+ and LinkedIn, etc.
I don't think I'm going to move away to any other review application. 
BEST of ALL it's FREE. I am keeping my fingers crossed that it stays that way :)
All the best to KudoBuzz!!!"
"exactly what I was looking for!
I spent the last month learning Shopify interface ins and outs, when I tried diferent page building apps they all had their own interface. yes they were more Customizable than shopify but also way more complicated and learning a new interface all over again just seems like such a big hassle.
LayoutHub solves just that, its interface is like Shopify's, only better.
took me about 5 minutes to get the hang of it as it is so similar to Shopify.
and the costumer support is outstanding! they don't have bots replying scripted answers. there are actual employees who respond quickly and solve your issues on the spot. they actually have been so kind to solve code issues that were left over by other apps. they also gave me tips on how to improve my store.
in conclusion, get this app!"
"I wanted to improve the user experience and decided to try Layouthub. I was very impressed by the templates’ clear and professional designs but even more on how my products’ pages looked much better. It was what I was looking for. The app is very intuitive and you can customize the fonts or colors very easily. 
I contacted the support team as I wanted the tabs on the product’s page to look in a certain way. Dilys from the support team was very helpful and even raise the query to the Developers team. My request was solved very quickly by integrating a 3rd app that I was using previously.
I’m still on the free trial and I’m still working on some pages, but I have signed up for the Basic plan which is perfect for my store.
I definitely recommend Layout if you want to improve the user experience and make your store looks professional and looks appealing to your customers. On top of that the support team is absolutely fantastic and helpful. Just go for it!"
"Piggybacking on the other review someone posted from Feb 19th, 2020. Who said ""Good because it's free and it works. My only gripe is that it is not mobile responsive. If it was, this would be 5 stars."" However, I'm rating it one star below that, simply because of the developer's pathetic response to that review.
I actually happen to be a front-end web developer who writes HTML/CSS and has created feeds like this from scratch. I would absolutely NOT call this either ""responsive"" or ""adaptive"" (it's literally neither). All it does is scale down proportionately so that the same number of images appear on mobile as on desktop, which makes them tiny if you have any more than 2 images showing in the row.
Do you remember how websites looked on phones before people started developing for mobile? You'd see the full desktop site, but you'd be zoomed way out so it fits on your tiny phone screen without having to scroll sideways. Nothing would be readable, everything was tiny. You had to pinch-to-zoom to interact with anything, see images, etc. This is exactly the same way this instagram feed functions. Setting max-width: 100%; in your CSS and height: auto; on your images is about the lamest excuse I've ever seen for ""responsive"".
So no, it's absolutely not responsive. Does it work on mobile? Yes. It acts exactly like an old non-responsive website does. However, ""does it work?"" is a pretty low bar when non-responsive sites also technically meet that requirement. A better question would be ""how is the user experience on mobile?"" and the answer to that question would be ""pretty garbage because you can't see anything"". In my opinion, that doesn't count as ""responsive"" at all.
Shopify's built in feature worked fine. Their developers just didn't want to be bothered to update their tool to use Instagram's new Graph API (which honestly would have taken one of their developers an afternoon) so instead they're passing the buck to third party developers. Now, if you want actual responsive functionality with your Instagram feed, you need to shell out more cash. It's lazy on Shopify's part, and seemingly the third party options are also pretty garbage unless you pay money.
But hey, it's free I guess."
"Just started today and it works really smoothly. The user experience is easy and you can build pages in minutes.
Also asked for help throught the live chat on a weekend and they provided support beyond expectation!"
"Super easy to use App, easy interface, great UX. l would recommend this to everyone since it's a free app as well"
"Swell Rewards is an excellent tool to add value to your online store. It takes a bit to get used to the interface, but once you start playing around with the plethora features, you quickly realize this is a strong tool."
Functionality seems to work well. Interface takes some work. Overall good app.
"Simple interface and easy to use. Only need to create one bundle, so the free plan was perfect. Easy to add via HTML also."
"While I haven't got my store up and running yet, the setup of this app is super straight forward, the interface fits very nicely, and everything is where you would expect it to be. Josh helped me through a few simple issues I wasn't to sure about, getting back to me within minutes which I didn't expect at all. Really looking forward to launching the store with this app."
Great APP easy to install and very user-friendly interface. Makes your store more social and credible.
Really cool app . I've just started using it so lots more to explore but so far really good and easy clear interface
I am loving this app so far. It has been the missing link in my store. My customers are loving it and it is bringing back more repeat customers. The interface of the app is 2nd to none. And support is fantastic. What more can I say? Get this today!
"Overall a great app that really helps provide a consistent look. My only gripe is that the interface can be a little buggy at times, but I can't imagine using Shopify without this time saver."
Great app -- intuitive interface and good results!
The app made it very easy to create a bundle for my store. The user interface and customer support is also commendable. Highly recommend to others. :)
"This works incredibly well, very happily surprised! It has a clean interface and links directly to Instagram showing my most recent content!"
"So far, I have had absolutely no issues! YOU GUYS ROCK! Keep up the good work!
Your interface is great, pricing is fair. and my customers are exited because of you all at Swell!"
S'well worth the free trial!! Simple to use interface and easy to implement. PLUS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! We asked for a few features and they jumped on it quick. The new newsletter pop-up for a sign-up discount just got installed a week after we mentioned it to them... Thanks again! :)
"This app does exactly what you need it to do. It's easy to use and the team at MLVeda are super helpful, willing to jump straight on a call if you need anything and work really fast to resolve any queries. They also make recommendations to better the user experience based on their expertise - very helpful. Thank you!"
"Support was excellent from the time I signed up a few days ago to test. Answered my litany of questions. I love the clean interface and unobtrusive tab bar. Unfortunately doesn't have enough of the features I need at the moment that other apps have. The free pricing tier and that it's based on volume and not customers are definitely key features for this app. 
I wish nothing but success with this new app, but at this time it isn't robust enough to use as my rewards/loyalty app."
This is the cleanest and most intuitive user-interface I have seen on any Referral app... Swell Done!
Good app. The user interface is very simple to use and easy to build. I like the apps integration and simplicity.
Very easy to use! would recommend it to everyone. nice and clean interface and the steps are very straightforward.
This is an awesome app. The support team is very helpful even if you are on free plan. The interface is easy and the app looks very good no matter what theme you use. I am planning to upgrade as I have more winning products
"I am using this app as a medium to encourage my website visitors to checkout the order. I liked the interface of the app. However, giving an option for users to add/remove slices would really help with further development of this wonderful app"
This app is pretty simple and I loved the interface. Easy to use and we can see the result on our page directly from the app. Recommend it
"Simple and easy to use, great for quick bundle discounts. Easy to navigate user interface makes set up a jiff."
Wheelify Spin Wheel Sales Pop app is really amazing. The features are simple and the interface is user friendly. It works like a charm and allow customers to get attractive discount as per your preference. The support team is very responsive they answered all my questions and provide resolution in no time. Thank you for the great app. Will use it on my other store as well. Viky
"Pretty darn awesome, just getting set up, but so far the interface is easy enough, even fora beginner like me.
I would recommend to anyone wanting to offer upsells and bundles
UPDATE--I had an issue where I accidentally deleted app, Customer Service was great, got me through my issues and back on the bundling road"
"Very easy to install, with helpful, knowledgeable, and fast customer service to assist. Simple and clean interface with extra features if you upgrade."
Just started using this app but it looks like it really works well for what i needed. I am using the bundle option only at this time. Interface is clean and easy to understand.
installation easy so far... have to wait to see for efficacy. Pleasantly surprised though at intuitive user experience
"Love the back in stock features, the interface is clear and easy to use. Support when needed has been quick and efficient. It is also useful for email/SMS collection and ""opt in"" for other store marketing. It does need the ability to change the ""opt in"" status within the app, the only option at present is to delete the record. Still a recommended app!"
Everything works. Interface is easy to use. I had a question and contacted support via chat. They resolved the issue via chat in 30 minutes. EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SUPPORT!
Very Easy to use versus other apps I've used. Would highly recommend using Spocket if you like ease of use and a great interface which connects seamlessly with your store.
"The interface is friendly and easy to use, I like it. The bundle overall appearance is clean and neat. So far I do not have any negative point about the app."
The best aliexpress competitor so far. Have a lot of products but still not many tech products are available. Customer support is super fast and super helpful. It has extremely easy user interface. I would give 5 star if it had gaming and some high ticket products.
The interface is easy and the customer service very speed and helpful! thanks for all! We definitely recommend this app :)
App performed as expected. Very easy and user friendly interface made it effortless to navigate through setup! Thank you
"Simple and easy to use. Working well so far.  Great support as well, Marcelo helped me do a simple change to the interface that made it the perfect combination with another app to create a custom product configurator"
Easy Graphical user Interface to search and Push to Shopify. The search filters are ideal for Dropshippers that provides a very flexible kind of Search. Spocket   also assist to boosting the sales as well.
"Great app and amazing customer service! Very responsive and effective. I like the features and the interface, very neat."
"I'm updating this again. I have mixed feelings on this app. I have had SO MANY problems with orders, but I will say that the issues were caused by the supplier and not Spocket themselves. As a result, I will share my thoughts on them separately.
Spocket
Spocket has a good interface where it is easy to upload products and get your store started. They do have customer service reps who do try to help you when you have a problem. They may be slow to respond sometimes, but John specifically does really try to resolve the issues and is a genuinely nice person who has the unfortunate job of having to relay what the supplier tells him.
Where Spocket itself has issues is that it does have accountability for the suppliers it has on it's site and the supplier I worked with brought me nothing but problems (see below). Spocket itself isn't bad, but I would say suppliers need to be vetted more and held to a higher standard. 
Fushia Odysseus (supplier)
If you use Spocket, DO NOT use this supplier. I had nothing but issues with them including:
- claiming they have products in stock only to have them cancel the order saying they are out of stock after they allegedly shipped the order (happened four different times)
- Forgot to send a piece of a product and pushed back when I reached out to Spocket about the missing item. The only reason the customer was able to get their complete set was because John sent a new one on Spocket's dollar
- claimed to have sent 8 packages on July 10th only to find that they did not drop off any of the packages at the post office until July 19th when they allegedly claim their processing time is 1-3 days and their shipping time is 1-3 days. They also repeatedly lied to Spocket saying they sent the items when that was clearly not the case 
Overall, Fushia Odysseus will not fulfill your orders on time and how you expect them to be. They will also not accurately track their inventory causing half your orders to be cancelled. They are a horrible supplier who does not know the first thing about customer service. They do not consistently or accurately do any of the things a dropshipping supplier is supposed to do. 
If I could rate the supplier negative stars, I would; however I am giving two stars to acknowledge that Spocket staff actually do care and make an effort to help you and do have the unfortunate job of dealing with Fusia Odysseus on these matters who was not communicative and straight up lied about things regarding their inventory and shipping. I would give John five stars for his effort on this, as he did really make an effort to help even though the supplier made it extremely unpleasant for everyone involved. 
If you find a good supplier on Spocket, you might have a better experience than I did with this app."
"Straightforward and intuitive user interface, super-customizable, and very helpful support. Recommended :)"
"I don't recommend this app. A lot of bugs, bad user experience. After we spent 2 days fixing the auto translation (which was super bad), the edits weren't saved.. Very bad customer support specially Ella and Angela."
"I used this app for the translation from english to french. The automatic translation is good, I only had to correct few expressions. The interface is userfriendly. And the customer care service is Great! I had issue putting the selector on the new theme, and Ripa provide a great service."
Works well! Much better than other drop shipping suppliers I've tried... Would recommend to everyone! User-friendly interface and nothing to complain about so far.
"The interface is user-friendly, and their support is very accommodating! The cart was not updating automatically, and they were able to fix it."
"The interface is GREAT to design custom things. But be aware, the Blog Post offer makes absolutely no sense. Blog posts are intended to be posted regularly - they are offering you... not 1 post per month, or 2 for 20 USD... it's 2 blog posts FOREVER, and that's it! That means you pay per year... 240$ to have 2 blogposts running, and if you want more.... like 20 (Which is still not much over the course of 1 year), they charge you even more... This is absolutely ridiculous. The best thing Pagefly should do is a plan for blogs... The price plan for the rest is fine, but not for blogs. Don't waste your time designing if you're planning to post regular blogs unless you want to pay the biggest plans for a simple blog."
"Very thoughtful service and perfect experience, a trustworthy application, because it makes your business more perfect and makes the user experience of the website stronger."
"I've been using the free version of PageFly and have had great success in building exactly what I need. I will say though... their customer service is far better than even their software. It is A+! I've used GemPages extensively as another page builder, but I do prefer PageFly. It took about 10 minutes to get used to a different interface, but I think it is overall a better platform! Thanks PageFly!"
Easy to understand interface and extremely helpful customer service when needed. There are lots of options for customization as well. 10/10!
Love the customer support - so quick and my issues are always resolved. I love talking to a person who I don't have to wait 2 hours for. Also - one of the easiest interfaces i've used for web design with so many options for customization.
"I've been using this for 2 months, so I can give an extensive opinion.
You Should NOT install this app if you're just starting out with dropshipping or  if even if you have been dropshipping for a while and I will extensively explain why...
Let me start off with the positives:
//Customer Service//
Spocket's customer service is top of the line! My questions were answered within 12 hours, sometimes even 1 hour! The explanation is concise, straight to the point and easy to understand.
//The User Interface//
Easy to browse products and sort based on specifications.
Now that that's out of the way (yes only 2 positives), let us talk about the negative in chronological order.
//The Pricing//
The $12/month starter plan is probably the best value. Anything else is a rip off if you only get 1-10 orders per day.
//The User Interface//
You can't edit the products in the app after you've imported them, which is fine. But if you touch any variation, THE WHOLE PRODUCT STOPS WORKING!
Then if you try to resync the product you'll soon discover that that's not even possible! You have to delete the product on your shopify store and then re-download via the app. If there's a variant that you don't want, YOU CAN'T DELETE IT.
You also cannot edit any order in the app. Product editing and Order editing are two basic functionalities in any other products-app, how can you not even get that right?!
//The Sellers//
There are multiple points here so I'll split it into subtitles.
--Anonimity--
This is very shady: All sellers get a pseudonym from Spocket so you can't find them online and try to cut a deal out of the app. Names like ""Orange Eunostous"", ""Orange Pine"" and ""Orange Charlie"" can't be real business names. I can understand the anonimity though. What I don't understand is that YOU CANNOT CONTACT ANY SELLER DIRECTLY VIA THE APP!!! You'll always have to contact the Spocket customer service for an answer from your seller. Took me a week to negotiate an international shipping fee down from $21(ridiculously high) to $15 , more on that later.
--The quality and consistency of sellers--
There is such a HUGE difference in quality between the sellers. 1 Seller will process your order in 1 day and another will take 7 days. 1 Seller will charge you $5 for shipping and another $20. YOU'LL DEFINITELY LOSE MONEY IF YOU DON'T CHARGE $15 SHIPPING ON YOUR OWN STORE. Spocket should hold it's sellers to a higher standard!
The only thing you need to become a seller, is prove that you have your own stock and that your products are unique. Let me tell you someting: Atleast 50% of the products can be found on Aliexpress for half the price!
--The Products--
Spocket constantly tries to push you to buy their Pro subscription for $99/month to get access to ""premium"" products. The products are not premium at all. Printed masks and aliexpress products are premium? haha, give me a break. NOT WORTH $49 or $99/month. You can find most of the products on Aliexpress or just your local printing shop for half the price. Most of the sellers are just a middelman that make money by selling to you, so only cutting into your profits. Don't fall for this.
--The shipping--
As I stated before, there's no consistency with the shipping time: An order can take 1 day to process and 3 days to ship, while another can take 1 month in total! Just recently, an order took 20 days to get shipped out and they only notified me after 14 days!! WHAT?!
At times it was literally FASTER to find the product on Aliexpress, place the order and get it delivered to your customer.
//What should (new) dropshippers do?//
If I were you, I'd look for sourcing dropshipping plugins that have a centralized stock. You're not Amazon, so don't put your trust into hundreds of sellers that you can't do a background check on for yourself to carry your brand. There are thousands of sourcers on like Alibaba or anywhere on the web that will gladly support your dropshipping business idea with no money down and a flexible growth formula. (I won't mention a specific company, because that would make this a dishonest review in my eyes) Don't get fooled and find something else!"
"Support was excellent, Ella helped me with setting up, answered all my queries and was super helpful. Interface is easy to navigate, recommended app"
"Really great functioning app, super great interface, and even better customer service. Thank you!! This app rocks"
"Installed to help keep customers up to date with fast moving product lines in these difficult times. Our Shopify template wasnt recognised automatically in the setup but one ping to support was answered instantly and within 5 minutes they had implemented and styled to our website. Cant fault that.
Time will tell how it copes with big mailouts when we have more signups , but certainly seems very professional and interface clean and easy to understand."
"It's an amazing app, any one can use it.  The staff was very helpful, great costumer service.  The interface is simple and easy to understand. I wish Spocket and staff the best, thank you and I wish I could be one of the success story here.  Grateful and hopeful"
Spocket is a great and easy clean user interface for dropshipping and i definitely recommend it to everyone starting or already doing it
I like it. product shipping times are decent and image quality it great. I would recommend to first timers for the easy interface and product selection.
"great support, quick installation, they were very helpful to guide me throught the process, and im happy with the interface and how it looks. great app. 
www.sheerskinco.com"
This app has been fantastic so far. It alerts customers automatically without us having to spend time physically to answering stock related questions. Another great feature is the interface was easily adjusted to match our website making the integration seamless.
"Hurray! We needed an extra feature that the developer added after an honest and detailed support request from our side. Now, the app helps us a lot to enhance Sales for our products. The interface is clean and well structured and for higher pricing plans, it even provides a lot of individualization possibilities. Be aware that the apps widget will show up on your website instantly. If this is not intended, navigate to ""Customize/Product Page Button/Behaviour/Widget enabled"". Also be sure that the workflow of the app fits to your needs and try to get in touch with the developer to add features if it doesn't."
"The builder fits pretty much what I need for my store pages. The interface might need a little time to get used to tho, it took me about a day or two to get used to the functions. Customer service was superb, they see to my problems pretty quickly and effective."
"I used to hate using Pagefly because it was difficult despite getting the best-looking pages once you battled through the interface but they've recently rebuilt the editor and its much easier!
Also, when I've been stuck recently, the chat function and help from the Support team has been second to none. Thanks PF!"
"I am using this app to source items from the US. It has nice products and has an easy user interface. Haven't had my first sale yet, but I'm enjoying the journey."
I've just recently started to use Spocket and so far it's been a great experience! Very simple and easy to use with seamless product import into my shopify store. Great user friendly interface as well.
"Overall, the reliability of this app has been great! Easy user interface for users to change their settings. Support has been prompt. Please give them a try!"
"I absolutely love PageFly. I can't code and have very little technical ability - PageFly saved me a fortune in development costs and in the end I actually enjoyed getting to know the app and creating a few pages. It can be a steep learning curve, but i promise you will learn fast and once you know your way around the interface you will love PageFly too. Support is quick to get back to you (I dealt with Angel via live chat) who sorted my minor issue very quickly. Great app - I would recommend to anyone"
The Best Support Team we have encountered. Very helpful and the app is amazing! I like the part when they link with many 3rd party app to make the user experience more friendly!
I've been using page builder to build landing pages for Facebook ads. Our conversion rates have increased from just below 3% to just above 5%. Their newest update and the customer support has been excellent. The interface is super easy to use and has way more preset options than the previous version. Awesome product! Highly Recommended.
I chose this app for it’s simplicity of use! I have enjoyed the user interface experience so far. The partnership between this app & Shopify has been seamless!!!
"I'm personally using the free version of PageFly. I was anticipating something quite restrictive with an incentive for us to buy some kind of subscription package in exchange for basic features. Something along the lines of, ""you've reached your maximum limit of 3 text boxes. Please purchase our subscription package to add 3 more"" kind of thing. That's why, when I actually started using it, I was FLOORED by the sheer flexibility of the page builder. I have not encountered ANYTHING to this moment that I wanted to do, that was hidden behind a paywall. Granted, I've seen some things about how having extra home pages are a pay-only feature, but that seems very reasonable. With regards to the editing suite itself, it is extremely flexible and perfect for someone like me who wants to intuitively design a basic website. The possibilities seem endless, especially when you realize you can use CSS code to edit your text and shapes beyond the ""built-in"" features of the app itself. With regards to intuitiveness, it *did* take me a while to get a hang of. I wasn't able to jump in and instantly master everything. I spent about a day and a half running in circles, slowly learning how to do very basic things like add text boxes, correctly format pictures, etc. Furthermore, don't expect much if you Google, there's a couple of articles and basic YT videos, but it's not like there's a big online community on sites like Reddit with readily available answers to your questions. However, that was made moot by the below: I ended up reaching out to their support for help, and it turns out they have a fully-staffed 24/7 support team. These people aren't reading off a script, either, it was like chatting with a friend on Discord. I explained I was new to shopify and was trying to understand how I could manipulate the interface to get it to do what I wanted. The support agent, Cristian, immediately sent me over clear instructions and was patient with me as I blundered about the interface. The support staff seem genuinely friendly, there's no language barrier, and they'll devote some time to helping you out, even if (like me) you're only using the free version. That was probably the most pleasantly surprising thing to me. Now, after about 2 and a half days, I'm finally really starting to get the hang of the editor. It may seem finicky at first, and it might be, but once you get through the frustrating phase and start understanding how to manipulate items, everything just clicks. I was also worried that I'd need to pay a subscription fee in order to make different home pages for different devices (mobile, computer, etc), but alas! It turns out that they have a fully-built in feature to dynamically change every single item (spacing, text appearance, etc) built-in to the app itself, for desktop, laptop, tablet, and phone. What a relief it was to see that! Closing summary: The perfect solution for your first website. Can be finicky at first, give it 2 days of frustration and then you'll be very happy. Almost no editing features hidden behind a paywall. Super responsive and friendly support. This app EASILY earned its 5 stars in my eyes."
"I don't recommend this app. Very very difficult to use, very expensive, don't work. A lot of bugs, bad user experience."
Very easy to use and curate products. Super intuitive interface and great customer service. Would very much recommend
"Good nice I like it I like all training and the support of SMS bump i really fell grateful.
Also I like its interface"
Great. Easy to use interface to make a simple or complex page. I asked for help showing a google calendar and they fixed it right away.
"Hi. Now were are very sattiesfyed with the app.
It is complicated to setup translation, becource of the 3 different interfaces. Hope that would be in one in the future !!!
Without you outstanding support, i have change to another soltion. But Sussie and other in Support were very fast a competend to help me, so everythink works well for now. A big thanks to them.
Next step is to get it work beetween 2 differnet Shopify shops.
Other app di not have you high customer support, so there are you the best.

"User interface is very friendly, the setup youtube video is vastly informational and simple. Customer support seems very kind at first glance, and I hope I will not need to bring up any issues with them. Just starting, but they seem to be a very strong platform!"
"Did a quick download to test this app and ran into a small issue, clicked live chat and someone was able to help me and fix my issue immediately. The interface is very user friendly. I need to play around with it more to get more familiar with it but so far it's awesome. Customer Service gets 5 STARS. I appreciate the quick response and their ability to diagnosis my issue."
PL is a very helpful and friendly lady who patiently guiding me to set up and use the app. Will give it 5 stars for its user-friendly interface and helpful staffs!
"Overall the interface seems to be pretty easy to understand. While I'd prefer Privy wait for asking for a review after a couple days, I found no issue understanding how to work with most things. The live editor also seems neat. My issue is sometimes the color picker gets cropped off the bottom of the page when editing some fields like button colors. I would also like to be able to change the Color of the social icons when I add that element to the bottom of the footer of a campaign email. Sometimes color pickers get cropped off the bottom of the screen there. Otherwise it seems ok, though I'm still on my trial. I give... 4 stars."
"Very clean and easy to use user interface on site.
More readable like the other similar apps."
"Great customer service! We've been using the app on our website, and we were having some trouble with translations that we wanted to skip, but Lilit in the support team was a huge help and fixed the problem over chat while we were talking. Straight forward and easy to use interface to update translations if they aren't quite perfect with the automatic translations. Thanks again!"
easy app and grateful to have their service on my online platform. Interface is user friendly and it gives a step by step procedure to help you with your first campaign. Good Job!
"The app is quite easy to use. It doesn't take much time to get used to the translation interface. The support team is also very helpful, especially Ella."
"Still getting used to the user-interface, but having trouble creating a password section on my forms....still under review"
This app is good! I have tried others but this has a much easier user interface so overall am a happy user :)
I used this app to find funny tees for dads.  It's been pretty intuitive so far.  I've been impressed by the simple interface and the easy way I was able to push products to my store.
"Very smooth interface, user-friendly, and great products! Great to see high-quality products coming out of the U.S.A"
"This App is everything I was looking for. I do use another dropshipper but Spocket has a better selection, faster site, and allows me to really find what I wanted in the products I sold. It's incredibly user friendly has an interface more companies should adopt. I look forward to working with them."
"I have used the Starter Package with this app.  The products are what I am looking for, and the search interface is fast and intuitive.  The one sample I ordered arrived exactly when promised, which was very important to me.  It is easy to edit the product information and push to my store."
Works just as expected - a bit less of an intuitive interface than Shogun which I've used in the past but half the price and customer support is super fast and helpful if you run into trouble!
I was seeking a reputable drop-ship company for my small business and found Spocket.  They have more than exceeded my expectations.  I find their interface easy to use and their products are very competitively priced.  I am so thankful that I found them!
They have great technical support. Felipe helped me solve a problem in minutes i was trying to solve. The interface is really easy to navigate as well
"Automatic translations are always a picky matter as they are not fully accurate. With GTranslate, automatic translations are pretty good. Only few changes to do and your website is bilingual. Interface is easy to use, especially for your manual translations.
And I would like to particularly thank Ella for her fantastic support. She answers any questions very fast and most of all, she follows up to be sure your issue is solved. This app worth its price!"
"What a great tool for FREE. Amazing features with amazing User Interface, making it easy to design. Thank you very much!
If you are in doubt, check out what I used it for on: www.dronescend.co.uk"
"I migrated to this app because Oberlo told me to, and it was a complete disaster. The app is not easy to understand like Oberlo, the interface is terrible, it costs a lot of money when there are similar and even better apps out there for free, and they won't stop spamming me to download the DSers Chrome extension, which I DO NOT WANT! Ugh, this app is HORRIBLE! STAY AWAY! EDIT: Found an app that is just like Oberlo but it is free - DSM‑AliExpress Dropshipping by Dropshipman. A Better alternative in my opinion."
Great experience and support. Easy to use interface for page building. Recommending it to make beautiful landing pages for your shopify website.
"Good, still learning ihow to use it, not very mobile user friendly and could do with interface update."
"I have only fulfilled a few orders with this app thus far, so my usage is limited. I will, however, commend DSers for their excellent customer service. I made a mistake learning the ropes and Catalina helped me out greatly via the Messenger service. They walked me through each step and provided excellent feedback that got me to where I needed to go. Thanks to them, I can comfortably use the app and interface!"
"Tentative 4 stars.  It's early days, yet.  But so far... easy to use.  Which is key.  And the creative interface had pretty much all that i needed for the first go 'round."
"I've just started using Spocket but it's sooo much easier than the other Dropshipping apps I've tried.  The interface is intuitive and user friendly and they have a chat option which means that help is just a quick click away!  I had a question yesterday that was cleared up with a chat within a really short period of time.  I'm really, really happy with Spocket!"
"Support team is very helpful, though sometimes you have to wait next business day for the dev team to be online. But they fix our issues right away. User interface could have been more user friendly but with basic knowledge on web development it is manageable. Overall, great landing page builder and very friendly support team. They have free pages which allows you to use and test their service first which works best for start ups and brands starting very small."
"very useful app, sometimes the traduction is not good but you can edit it manually with a user friendly interface, also the customer support is wonderful, thanks Borya and Ripa"
"top, lot of integrations, good interface and it helps you a lot to build from scratch your email marketing campaign"
Nice and easy to setup a discount popup window on my Shopify store. Interface is intuitive and product is highly recommended.
Love it! Easy to use and very helpful! I would def recommend people use his app. Simple interface and helpful tools.
"The concept is wonderful. The interface is easy to use. The support is great. The suppliers are from the US to w/c I can confirm after placing a bunch of orders via their app.
By the way, I used this for my old store and will use it for my new one. My store concept is illuminating life with wonderful finds/items/products."
User interface is nice. I hope it will increase our sales. Will comeback soon to review again.......
"Had really high hopes for this app. The interface is the best out there, as well as the integrations and capabilities. It's super impressive. 
Sadly, they score a zero for execution. The text messages take anywhere from 10-30 minutes to reach the recipient, and the customer support is not great. 
If they can fix these major issues, they'll have a customer for life and a 6 star review. 
***UPDATE***: Founder reached out and tried his best to make things right. It was much appreciated. I tried the software again and there were still a couple bugs that I didn't have the patience to deal with, so I passed on it. Still think it's a powerful and impressive piece of software, just too many minor issues for me to deal with."
"Update:
The cancellation process is a pain. I've been trying to cancel my subscription for three days! I keep getting excuses. Make it easy for customers to cancel on the app since you charge separately from Shopify. I've read other reviews about people being charged after they've cancelled and uninstalled the app. If I'm charged, I'm going to report as fraud. Make it easy for customers to cancel without having to talk to anyone. 
Update:
Every time I use this app, there is always a technical issue. Customer service is quick to respond but they rarely offer a solution which isn't beneficial to me. I think the concept is great but they need to improve the technical issues and provide solutions instead of template answers. As an example, I imported over 50 products into my store and the images are in webpage format and not jpeg or png, which is a requirement for Shopify. They told me to delete all of the products and then reimport because of an issue with the code. I also pay someone to write product descriptions and their work would be deleted. I am definitely searching for other vendors and apps to use. I wouldn't rely on this app. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The products are a bit pricey and not wholesale prices. I'm going to order samples and I like having that option. Customer service is quick and great! Spocket, however, lacks a lot of features to make the user experience much better and the team doesn't seem receptive to customer feedback.
1. Spocket doesn't have an option to unpublish. I have to make additional edits in Shopify and I don’t want customers to see an unfinished product.
2. There is no option to add products to multiple categories.
3. No option to add a sale or compare price.
4. I can’t see shipping times or other vendor information in the important list unless I search for each product.
5. All of the tags or keywords are auto-populated and most of the time I delete most because it doesn’t fit my store, brand or product. Extra time deleting instead of just letting me add only or select the ones I want. 
6. Some text editing features are missing with font and I can’t add a table in the text area. This isn’t probably a big deal but great to have.
7. Add an option to apply the same pricing to all variants instead of pasting or typing in each field.
8. Bonus-see vendor information and ratings such as order accuracy and speed."
"Very good application. I like it so much. And basic interface, simple looks. It is so easy for me. Thank you"
"I has a rocky start, but overall Spocket has been awesome. The customer service has been great and on top of it. The interface is the best I've used compared to other similar apps."
"I purchased this app after having worked with a few developers and not getting the results I wanted. This is a fantastic app with a very intuitive user interface. Also, they excel at customer service. 5 stars."
"Love this app, now my overseas buyer can use their native language to shop at my store. I'm using the bilingual language translator. Love the feature that you can manually translate the language. Ripa and Suzan were a great help. Both of them help me with the coding stuff. Ripa went the extra mile to help me do custom positioning and spacing of the language selector both at the desktop and mobile interface to suit my website. Thank you!!"
"Muito bom, interface boa. Intuitivo, fácil de usar. Recomendo fortemente a experiência no uso do app"
"Sprocket is simple to install, the interface is really clean and easy to use. Product selection is missing a few categories right now, but there's still a lot of quality products to choose from. I like that you can filter where products ship to and from."
large selection  discounts are ok   interface is better than other apps one click processing  fast shipping
"Getting started, like the interface, will see how the product does in the long term, im learning about drop-shipping now"
"Using Privy on my second site and really happy with the overall user experience. The setup is smooth, the UI is friendly and I really hope it works out well.."
This app has helped improve the confidence I have in running my business. the interface is easy to use and so far I like the product options a lot.
"If like me you're thinking that the standard pages in Shopify are pretty poor in terms of customisation, features and aesthetics, then I definitely recommend PageFly. They provide a drag-and-drop interface which allows you to build your pages, which makes it really easy for someone like me who is not very into coding. They have a really large portfolio of widgets and templates to use, and it is really quick and easy. The free plan gives you enough capability to test all the features and build a page, which I used to test the app, and I was so happy with it that I am now on the first-tier paid plan which allows me to create the amount of pages I need for my site. Above all, the customer service is spot on and they have been extremely quick to respond to any questions I have had. 5 star rating!!"
"very intuitive and user friendly. made adding new features to my store extremely easy with simple to follow instructions and interface. also, really good customer service: very friendly and efficient. would definitely recommend"
"The solution is ugly, expensive and the user experience is terrible. Wouldn't recommend anyone to waste their time."
Spocket is the best app for drop shippers! It's has the cleanest user interface out of all the other shopify Dropshipping apps.
Just started using Spocket. Works like a charm so far. Great selection of products to dropship. Nice interface.
"They have a really nice selection of products to dropship and you can specify which country to ship from and to so it is a nice overall interface and some nice ways to search for products to add into your store.  I'm sure whatever your niche is, you will be able to find products to fit it with this selection."
So good that I can import products from EU/US! It shows a very clean interface and a very decent product filtering
"The user interface is super friendly, the app is very well made and very easy to set up. Within a couple of minutes my first campaign was live."
"Such a good app! I can find really just reliable products compared to cheap things from china. I think I can really make a great store! I like the user interface, very friendly. Has such a nice design and it's so easy to find and add products to your import list. I haven't found any faults thus far."
Amazing customer service I have always been thoroughly helped with all issues I've encountered! Would like the user experience to be improved.
"Pretty solid app. Not all the interfaces are as intuitive as they could be, but overall it works really well."
Incredible App. We have just start to use it but interface is great and it is very simple to start. Hope we would do great business with them.
"On the fence. 
Since I started off using Oberlo, maybe I am a little bias. But come to think about it, if I had started off with this App and found Oberlo after-the-fact, I would probably greatly reduce my usage of this App. 
Dont get me wrong, its great for a free App, even though they charge you do fully use the site, but its functionality needs improvement. 
First off, charging to use your Store brand on packaging is lame, and marking some items as Premium is lame as well, as there is no guarantee that one product will sell greater than the next and it also kinda says, ""Hey, here is a few crap products to sell, but if you want the good stuff, pay for it."" 
Secondly, after adding products, the List Price and differs and doesn't add up even if you calculate the added shipping costs. Pay attention. And there are many variables available with no product picture. And the Product Pictures available do not sync in your store. U have to manually Sync them. And back to pricing, there needs to be a simpler way to set the prices, I ended up doing it within Shopify manually for many variants of the same product. Cuts down on time management. 
This is not a bad review, really, just statements on ways to improve, in comparison to a completely free App with, a better interface and more products. Hopefully I will change my mind over time."
"Clean interface, love it. I will be using this app a lot as I feel like it is very helpful in growing any type of brand! The market is changing have to follow the crowds and the trends baby!"
"Installed, up and running fast. Easy to use and navigate interface. No install problems or glitches. Seamlessly integrated with my store. Looking forward to future results. A definite 5 star!"
The SMSBump is a great app with perfect ROI. The user interface is friendly and easy to use. Would recommend!
its a nice application but have not used it fully though the user experience and the user interface is good
Nice app. Good products. i liked the interface. import options are good. Prices are okay. worth a try.
"The app boosts conversion like anything, it has an excellent interface and awesome tutorials. Mike and his team was very helpful when it came to setting up the app and appreciate their ongoing support too! The does not cost too much really and the ROI is great so worth investing on it. Way to go SMS Bump!"
SMS Bump is extremely useful and rewarding for our store. Excellent customer service makes it a must-have app for your store. It boosts conversion like anything and the app has an excellent interface with awesome tutorials.
This app is extremely useful and rewarding - the instruction coupled with easy interface means you can learn how to send customers SMS messages within minutes. A must-have app for your store.
"This app is extremely intuitive - the instruction coupled with easy interface means you can learn how to send customers SMS messages within minutes. 
Also, the support is unparalleled. Mike has been awesome and has made sure we have everything we need. 
We checked out a few other SMS apps within Shopify and are so glad we went with this one."
SMS marketing is the future in digital marketing and SMS Bump is helping us to earn more extra revenue. It helped us to create many returning customers and the app has easy-to-use interface and perfect customer support team.
"My store has seen a huge increase in sales from this app it is a superb app. It has generated so many return customers with an easy-to-use interface, fantastic support, and insane ROI. We average about 20k ROI. INSANE! LOVE THIS APP!"
Easy to use app. The interface is simple yet very effective. Definitely the best app for language translation! Happy to use it!
"Very friendly user interface.. very Nice produits To add To our collection..
A must have for print and demand.."
"I like the interface of this app, but honestly that's where it all stops.
The fulfillment screen lacks details. You have to pay $79 to be able to see any meaningful information about your orders or even add products (25 products per month if you're on a free plan).
Nicer layout than Oberlo, but far less advanced."
"I just started using this app, and reached out to PageFly regarding a cart interface error on one of the pages I was building – they responded immediately and fixed it within 12 hours (the issue was resolved across the entire site). Terrific support!"
"Spocket has a fairly large variety of vendors offering a wide selection of products.  Like any vendor, you do have to do your research on the quality of the product and determine if the margin you are given to work with allows you to make a profit.  Some items have an attractive discounted wholesale price, others not so much and are not worth the advertising costs.  Spocket support is wonderful, responsive, and the interface is very easy to use and navigate.  If you are familiar with Oberlo, Dropified, ProductPro you wont have any issues understanding Spocket.  I definitely recommend giving Spocket a test drive."
Great tool! Does everything as stated and has a smooth user friendly interface.
"I rate this app with a 2 and that level is SOLELY due to the customer support, especially Angel in the middle of the night. But as far the app goes, usability and ease of use......it's a 1 at best unfortunately. Completely designed for developers and VERY technically minded people. And the videos that are made to explain things are done by someone that is technically and programmatically minded as well. Clearly the person who makes them does not make them for novices/intermediate level users. So for those of us with some technical knowledge and that have used WooCommerce and Wordpress for years, Big Commerce, Shopify and Magento for ecommerce as well - this thing is a massive headache to use. We only have been using it for the blog because what comes with Shopify is more basic than we need. But with the difficulties that we're having and the massive time suck it is to complete even one page or one high end post, I'm not sure that the ROI is close to being there. In addition, one of the features that is of most interest which is the integration to pull your products into your pages/posts is limited as supposedly the interface with Shopify only allows a few products to feed into Pagefly at a time. That means you then have to go find your product, get the link, remove the url and copy/paste the product into Pagefly and hope it might find it then.....WOW. Adding products into your posts at strategic locations should be intuitive and take no time at all......not here! Many of the features to do that aren't working and whether it's the app or the fact products/collections aren't interfacing from Shopify completely, idk - Combine that with the difficulty and non-intuitive carousel setup for products to post and be showcased at the end of a blog post a la Amazon and it's taking 2-3x as long to create a quality post as you'd ever spend in Wordpress. We are looking hard for other options to use than this and hopefully will find something that works well for us. I wouldn't ever recommend this product and wish that I had noted the naysayers more than I did BEFORE we got into this. Again, lovely support team and Angel is A REAL angel, but the app is not."
New to Shopify and PageFly is the first app I used to build various pages for my store. It's pretty easy to use once you get familiar with it and their support team is super friendly and efficient. People without web design knowledge might find some of the features on the interface a bit difficult to understand though. But you can always talk to support and they usually reply very quickly.
"The app is used quite easily, better if you have a minimum of HTML and CSS skills to define the details, but the interface is clean and simple, you learn to build beautiful pages quickly! The support is great, they are always present and do not abandon you until they completely solve any problems!
Recommended!"
"App has a very nice interface. Very easy to use.
My problem is the prices being charged for the items.
$20 t-shirts, $27 bracelets - this is your cost to buy the items, not the suggested retail prices.
Too high for dropshipping."
The support team was really helpful and listened to my issues thoroughly. The user interface is really easy to understand and use. I highly recommend anyone wanting a quality page builder to use Pagefly.
"I just started using this app. My competitors are using this app. Their interface feels beautiful, so I am here. 24-hour online communication is very convenient, your questions can be answered and resolved very quickly In short, this is a very powerful application, I have to continue to study it."
With Quick 24/7 support DSers is my first choice for dropshipping products across the globe. Easy to understand steps and documentation and excellent user interface loaded with ton of features. This is highly recommended to everyone.
"I am on the fence between 3 and 4 stars. The interface is nice. With Australia, Canada, USA, and Spain vendors, most product descriptions are better than those limited to China, though some from China are also included.
Restricting product searches to specific types of products yields limited results. Inventory is mostly apparel. Many items are nearly out of stock. If you hunt very well, you can end up with a few good products."
Great interface and functionality. Reasonably priced. Satisfied so far. Except that I have to write 100 characters to submit and now I'm done
Great and easy to use interface. Customer service is really fast and friendly :) Thank you Recommended
Eprolo is an amazing app that any dropshipper should have. I love having a dedicated shipping agent to answer any questions I have and help me with any issues that arise. Shipping times are a lot faster and my customers appreciate it! I had a lot of shipping issues when I was purchasing directly from aliexpress and now I have a peace of mind knowing my agent will take care of any problems that come up. Their prices are also cheaper or the same as most other suppliers. Their interface is easy to use and fulfilling orders through eprolo has saved me a bunch of time.
"Probably the best Dropshipping App on the market. Very good and easy to use. Easy to use interface, quick delivery on all items."
I am learning to use this app and it likes me a lot its interface. It is very didactic and has options that allow does marketing very blunt. I really recommend them to everyone
Great customer service! Quick response and easy interface. thanks! I recommend this shopify app! 3 characters left
this app has a very user friendly interface and lots of effective features that assist me in customer information acquisition!  I would definitely recommend this app to any business owner
Such a beautiful and easy interface!  I like the selection as well.  Definitely recommend this dropshipper.
Pricing is better than a lot of other competitors but rightfully so...just not a good user experience and the aesthetic + default templates are very unappealing.  I will be looking into alternatives soon.
"fast processing, great service, easy too source new products and very friendly user interface. Recommending"
So far so good Very easy to use and set up. Clean and simple interface. Its a good bang for your buck. I have only set up one email template and it was a breeze
"Update 2: I am lowering to 1 star after sale experience
Update 1: I am updating my review lower for these reasons
A sale of a product that was listed as shipping from Canada was actually shipped from China and never reached the customer. The first issue is that if the source was correctly specified, we could have kept the customer informed of the timelines. Second issue is that there was a chargeback because the customer did not receive the product, which happens once in a while for China shipments. Spocket team was not able to do anything or refund the product cost. So we lost both ways, one to the customer for non receipt chargeback, and also the payment to Spocket. Since they have no ownership, and we cant talk to the product seller directly to resolve issues, it takes forever and this app is a waste of time and money. Just use Oberlo or other China product interfaces.
1. Depth of product offerings are low for my industry. However it may be good for other shops so no harm in trying out
2. The margins appear good, but if you do a deep search you will find that many products are available at lower retail than suggested. It may be good to start with, but eventually you will be tempted to move out of the app and build your own relationships with wholesale companies just to be competitive in the market, let alone save the monthly cost - always look at annual outflow of an app cost even if it looks fine on monthly basis.
3. Proves review counts and ratings do not paint the true picture. In this case you get a free month if you give a 5 star rating, so most people who install will give a 5 star rating in the first few days itself to get the free month, which leads to a ton of reviews done by people who have not experimented with the app, products and prices.
4. Having said that the app itself works fine, if they can sign up more wholesalers, avoid double dipping and reduce their margin on the products and rely on the monthly fee they may become competitive
I will be removing this app.
---
Just installed. First look seems fine. Tried importing 1 product and it went though easily. Let me test how it works and depth of product offerings before leaving a better review."
"I absolutely enjoy using PageFly! It's simple, user friendly interface makes website customization so much more easier for non-tech users like me. And I love that they have a free plan with all the features which is all you need for a basic website. On top of everything is their 24x7 customer care. Every support person I spoke to was very quick to respond, knowledgeable & polite. I highly recommend this app for budget conscious users looking to create highly customized websites for fraction of the cost of hiring a professional website builder!"
"Good interface for designing newsletters.  Just wish that there were more templates to choose from. Not clear what features are free, however."
"This app has changed the way I do business - I can now create custom web stores for each client within my main Shopify store... total game changer. Really intuitive interface right out of the gate, and once I got the hang of it it's proved powerful enough to accomplish anything I can think to do with it. Customer support is also on it, usually replying via chat within a couple minutes any time I have a question and always solving my issue quickly and cheerfully. I love PageFly!"
"La meilleure app pour l'e-commerce, service client très réactif, interface o top, commande très rapide."
"We have used PageFly to build our page and it has been great. Not only is the interface intuitive, but it gives you incredible power over what you would like to change. This plugin turns Shopify into a completely different platform and makes it accessible to the less technologically advanced. On top of this, the service is incredible. The live chat feature is there 24/7 and the team is always listening. They provide a level of service that doesn't usually come with a plugin and I couldn't recommend a plugin more as a result."
"Hi I installed the app and liked the interface, i sent support a message just to see if they are responsive but so far didn't get an email back from them, this concerns me on moving on using them."
This is a very user friendly app. So suitable for an app dummy like me. Super smooth interface which allows me to design my desired popup
I like the popups but some of the interface is difficult to manage. The coupon generation changed in my store and created a bad situation.
"Good results after one month. Simple interface, simple to set up. Recommended."
"I like this App, it's easy to handle, simple. 
Easily understandable accurate interface.
Good price for many single plus services."
"Not finished still looking chat help but great interface, look and feel.
Hoping to get back in to finish and launch my sign in special"
"The interface is not that user friendly, but the support is totally awesome! They have free package and I strongly suggest you to try it out."
"Très bonne application. Le prix est correct et l'utilisation très agréable. L'interface est intuitive, complète, et permet une rapide création de pages. Par ailleurs, le support est réactif et efficace. Rien à redire."
"Love this app! Whenever I run across a theme issue, they solve it. I love their interface to create new beautiful pages on top of your current Shopify theme. If you are looking for a page builder, get this app now!"
This app is a must-have to understand the user experience in the store. It is very easy to use. Just add the app and you're ready to see recordings! No need to touch the code.
"Very Helpful, quick and easy user friendly interface. The Free Plan is worth a bundle on its own, great stuff."
Easy to use and set up. Does the job quite well and its FREE! Interface is nice and the default design is also simple yet elegant.
Awesome app to track visitors! The interface is easy to use and recorded sessions are up almost instantly.
Absolutely Excellent interface and tools. I've tried 4 other apps and this one is by far the best. The popup creator is straightforward and easy to use.
"Very good app. Simple user interface and easy to use. The only downside is I have an email marketing app which has a live view for website visitors, not as detailed though. If I check a customer's activity on Better Replay, it will show on the email marketing app as the same customer visits my website again. Will recommend though. My website is www.hummingbirdlifestyle.com."
"I've been using this app for a few months and really enjoy it compared to other page builders I've used in the past. It has a pretty easy user interface and integrates with a lot of other apps I use for reviews and subscriptions. Customer support has also been very quick to help resolve some of the issues I've had with integrations, Shoutout to Angel!"
I used this app to understand my website User Experience and user journey. It helped me a lot. Good Work :)
"Easy-to-navigate interface and when we came up to a real barrier, their online support was super quick and made the changes for us. That added support makes all the difference and Pagefly has it in spades."
"Just got the app, so far so good! Interface is easy to use and not as complicated as others i tried"
"A very easy to use application thanks to a simple interface and an intuitive drag & drop system (even simpler than Wordpress?!).
If you are afraid to test this application, don't hesitate anymore! Because the IT support is more than reactive to the slightest question and the slightest need.
I highly recommend it!"
"Takes a bit to understand the interface but after you get going its great. The live support is pretty amazing. There seem to be agents available to help all the time, and they respond very quickly."
"hey i am quite satified with user experience with shopacado.
the customer support provided to me was to good and supporting!
thanks nivi!!"
I just started using this app. So far so good! Very easy-to-use interface and no coding skills required! Love it!
"So far so great! Great interface, easy customization on campaigns! Connection with MailChimp was smooth."
"Amazing support from PageFly, especially from a lady called Angel. App looks really good, great for adding features and content to your existing pages. The interface is logical and easy to use. Mark"
Insightful app for making decisions. It is easy to use with a clean interface. Would recommend to other business owners.
Amazing customer support from Zarah. Zarah promptly solved my problems and went to the extent of making the changes for me and sharing with me how to do it on my own. The app is easy to set up and the interface is clean. Highly recommended.
"I've been using this app for the last 2 weeks, I do like it a lot. Great interface, super easy to use, the customer service through their live chat (especially Felipe) is amazing. It's really worth your investment!"
Simple and smart app.It can really make people add more product to their cart.People love simple interface and discount :)
"I have to say it looks very slick! I’ve seen apps that can learn a lot from this one. The interface is easy to work with and makes it fun to create your discounts. Just a simple step by step super easy set-up. Also more advanced settings for those who want to be a bit more creative and change the layout. You can even write your custom CSS. I ran into some trouble installing a discount and customer support was fast as lightning, friendly and helpful. Definitely worth a five star review! I definitely recommend it!"
"While the design interface is great, Privy will not sync my existing Shopify contacts into the dashboard contacts list.  This has to be done manually via a CSV file.  So if you are gathering contacts without a Privy approved app directly into your Shopify Customer list, even though they ""accept email marketing,"" then you will have to do constant manual updates to keep the lists synced.
For example, if you are using an email signup form that is already integrated into your Shopify theme, Privy will not recognize these contacts and force you to do a manual import. So if you are happy using only what Privy gives you, then you are fine.  If you want to use what is already integrated into your theme, then be aware Privy will not accept these contacts."
nice app with a great user friendly interface!
"Extremely Helpful, I had difficulties in setting up the page and Paula from the Support team was there in every step to make me understand and resolve my issues. Thank you so much. I can't wait to see the response on my new page. I only wish the interface was more simpler hence 4 :)"
"Brand new to PageFly and I'm digging it! Gorgeous interface, clear directions where you need them and plenty of options to customize to your heart's content. Pleasantly surprised how easy it was to get up and running. Delighted with the uber-responsive customer service chat. Thanks PageFly!"
Very good to learn about the user experience. Fast and easy to install. I can recommend this app for every shop.
"Looks good until it asks you to pay to restore old versions, extremely annoying to lose all progress when editing for mobile and then finding out the desktop version changed automatically, made me waste a lot of time. I did not like the buggy interface either, a bit confusing"
It is a great app! It is good to be able to see what your customers are doing on your store and how you can improve the user experience. I have made about 10 changes on my store to remove clutter and make it as straight forward as possible
"Rápido atendimento, integração simples e de fácil utilização. A nova interface esta ainda melhor!!!"
Friendly user interface + friendly and expedite support by helpful staff. A few more functional design templates would be great.
"We needed a way to show different volume discounts and this app does exactly what it says. The interface is user friendly with the ability to customize to our requirements which was a big plus!! A massive shout out to the support team, especially Pavi who promptly answered and resolved all the queries/issues I encountered from the beginning. Thank you team and keep up the great service and product!"
"Excellent, simple to set up app that just works. I used OneSAAS to interface data from Shopify to Quickbooks Online (QBO). I set up the interface in 10 minutes via the app, and transactions came through accurately. Troy from OneSAAS customer service was also very helpful. Highly Recommend."
"Absolute best App for building your website. I have used every builder App available. Tested them for over a week. PageFly is simply the best. 100% error free pages. Rank high in Google SEO. Easy to use interface. Support is Rock-solid, fast and helpful. This App is LEGIT! I have over 25 years of web programming experience and can say this is the ONLY App you need to build your website."
"Best app for dropshipping, great interface, fast bulk orders and great support everytime I contacted via messenger. Thanks so much to Zark for the fast response and understanding my problem."
"Easy to use interface, and very helpful support team. Would recommend for anyone looking to add excellent product pages and landing pages to their site. - Malik Instruments Team"
very easy to use and useful app! the interface is user-friendly and the customization options are great! many thanks to the creators!
"Absolutely stellar customer service available 24/7, user-friendly interface. 10/10 would recommend. (Marek from StandandStretch.com, designers for Keith of LoCo Cookers)"
good support from Krystal with Dsers customer support. the product availably is great the app interface is easy to use and again the friendliness and professionalism of Krysta must be noted.
"It does give us information about what are the things our customer see on the website. If you would like to improve your user interface and user experience, this app worth a try."
"This is a very helpful tool to create customized product pages. Support is quick, very friendly and helpful! I didn't give 5 stars only because I have the feeling, the editor could be a bit more intuitive and there are some discrepancies in how elements are displayed there and how they look on the final page. But overall it's a pretty solid app and interface :)"
"EDIT 5/27/19:  The refunds issue has been fixed.  However, there is still a bit of manual entry as the software is unable to determine if an item was restocked in Shopify, so it defaults to 1) restocking the item if all money was refunded or 2) only returning the money (and not the product) if only a portion was refunded.  Still a great interface, but a bit cumbersome if you offer a ""money back guarantee"" or any instance where the product would be kept when funds are refunded.  Still can't say enough about the level of service and follow-through from the team:  Hazel, Troy, Vincent, and Marck - they are all amazing!!
---
EDIT 4/23/19:  While I still think this is a great app, they still have not been able to fix a bug that prevents refunds from posting to QBO.  This has prevented 186 transactions and required me to hand key each and every one. I/They have been aware of the issue for 2 months and there is no timeline as to when this will be resolved.  I will update this review when it's been fixed.
----
Best app on the market - hands down!  I tested several for my clients and landed on OneSaas for their seamless automation and easy but robust setup.  As an accountant I love all the options they provide (chart of accounts mapping, seamlessly adding new inventory items into QBO, inventory update sync, etc.) as it makes my life a whole lot easier.
The best part; however, is the AMAZING customer support team.  I've had a few bumps along the road and they have been there to quickly and efficiently handle every situation I've thrown at them.  I think I've spoken with almost the entire support staff, but mostly I've chatted with Troy and Hazel.  They are very friendly, knowledgeable, and often go out of their way to ensure everything is handled quickly.
Stop considering and just do it.  You won't be sorry."
"I tried this app and better than any paid app in Shopify.
The app has a simple interface which easy to use."
"If your looking for a simple app to handle wholesale and discount pricing rules, this is it. Great backend interface for quick setup and design. Parth and the team were great, we run a custom non-shopify theme, and they were able to tweak the app to work perfectly with it. And best of all, within less than 30 minutes of me installing it. Having 3 stores on shopify running all different types of code and apps, this has by far been the smoothest and quickest any app support has ever worked. Plus their app is like the cheapest out there for this level of features, and they have annual price breaks too!"
Great interface and easy to use. Instant updates on my site so I can see what I'm getting in real time.
"I've only been on for five minutes and I love it. It's easy to use and has a great interface, and even set up a pop up on my website automatically, something I spent weeks trying to figure out with MailChimp. And I love how expanded the free plan is. I can't wait to grow with it."
"It seems the application is very convenient, especially for Shopify, the interface is quite understandable, and let's see how it will be next, but for now, your application pleases me! thank"
Simple and easy to use interface for building menus. Had an issue with the responsiveness on tablets and their support was quick to fix the issue! Highly recommend!
"NICE SO FAR, INTERFACE IS PRETTY SIMPLE AND EASY TO NAVIGATE AND I LIKE HOW IT COMBINES EXIT INTENT WITH EMAIL MARKETING SERVICES ALL IN ONE. CUTS BACK ON ADDING TOO MANY APPS TO MY SHOPIFY STORE."
"Very CLEAN interface, but clean doesn't mean easy to use. It's complex, there are many nuances and little bugs that you have to figure out. For example, you can't drag to adjust sizes in mobile view - you have to be in desktop. It's a good product once you get the hang of it, but the way it's setup it's very easy to forget little things here and there when you're running many campaigns."
Great app that helps me do what I need like creating landing pages and pop-up pages. I love the versatile interface designs
I am switching from a different discount app. It's a very clean interface & great support so far! A+
App has a very nice interface and looks very professional and Had a small issue with setting up the widget and their team responded Via the chat in less than 5 minutes and fixed the issue for us. Very Happy!
Simple app. Clean interface. Easy to navigate and customize which I love. Customer service was excellent! They really did respond in under 5 mins like they say in the chat feature. Which is also a great thing to have within the shopify app.
"After trying a few landing page design apps, we found that this app is SO easy to use! The interface is very intuitive, the integration worked seamlessly and the functionality is amazing...especially for a free app. We had some design issues on the landing page we created...we reached out to support on a Sunday morning and received help within minutes. 
A huge thanks to Aldwin for helping us with all of our small issues. He was fast and fixed everything in no time.
We highly recommend this app!"
"Straight forward set-up interface which is exactly what we needed to we can focus on the sales. The additional features such as editing the visuals is also extremely easy, nothing fancy in setting up, but results are more than expected. I have to give a plus that we can see and test our offers to make sure then run right both to our liking and our customer's satisfaction. Add 1 more star and make it 6 stars overall with the great customer service! Props to Zarah for the help!"
"You'd think there would be more apps like this for shopify. This one fits the size chart bill perfectly. Provides us with a super simple interface for adding custom size charts for our wide variety of vendors and product types. I reached out to the developer for support in hopes they would be able to provide some customizations to the app (in exchange for money). They emailed be back stating what I wanted could be done with the free app, and gave me the code necessary to do so, all within 24 hours. Thats the sort of service I'd expect from a paid app, not a free one. Great developers, Great app."
Easy to use and great interface.
Wonderful app. Very interactive and engaging. The interface is clean also.
"Completely new to Shopify and Privy I was able to configure and get the app running in little to no time at all! The user interface could be made a little more intuitive, but a little time discovering the dashboard yield all the required buttons or links very quickly. I recommend Privy without hesitation."
"I use this app to make email marketing designs and a suscription pop up. So far everything's great, I love the intuitive interface."
Very nice interface. A lot of amazing features for a FREE app. Customer support is EXCELLENT! Helped me fixed my pages. Recommended!
"App has a clean and easy-to-use interface, does everything you need, and the support staff is responsive in under 5 minutes and takes care of everything. The best app support I have ever experienced, hands down."
"Needed this app to build a new product page, and the interface is very user friendly. If I had any questions, I asked the support team who was amazing! Shoutout to Touqir for the help on my page"
helped me set it up and resolved an issue i had. good support and nice interface.would recommend others use it
Really nice laid out app with a clean interface
"Love this app, it does many things for you that increases conversions without degrading the user experience"
"the app is perfect works well, and customer service is 10/10 very responsive and is fit for purpose, easy to use interface and get the job done"
After trying other page builders I came back to PageFly. The interface is the most user friendly and the support second to none. A huge thanks to Paula to always promptly helping me when I need it. Would definitely recommend PageFly if you want to build highly customised high converting landing pages without stress!
"The app is very good, simple interface and give you some key features. I'm I've been using it for a week now. Needed support to integrate it properly twice, since i'm using custom paid theme, and the integration is not that smooth as the free ones. The support was helpful and fulfilled my needs."
"Super easy to use, very good interface, it does what it promises. Support team is excellent. I would totally recommend!"
This app really help me design and setup discounts for the first time. Navigation is simple and managing the back end interface is easy too
nice app excellent support work very easy better user interface nice support team that help and solve problem
I have just started using Dsers and was faced with learning the interface issues and their support was quick to respond and assist me in getting my issue fixed. Highly recommend Dsers!
Particularly like the uncluttered interface and intuitive UX. I'll be back to edit my review once I've used the product for a while
"Just wanted to be able to create a pop up to offer a coupon and acquire subscribers. Privy solved that and then some. Love the simple interface that clearly shows what you're setting up, and what's going to happen when a customer interacts with it. Free plan is great but would be nice to have a $5-$10 monthly plan to simply remove branding for lower traffic stores."
"Good product , clean interface and design. It is easy to setup and fast customer support. Thank you."
Very clean interface. Easy to use I can see this saving money I especially like the exit intent portion.
"J'ai testé toutes les applications de reviews et c'est de loin la meilleure, en terme de temps de chargement et d'interface administrateur. Le support est rapide et efficace."
"J'apprécie grandement l'application DSers. DSers a le mérite, entre autres, d'avoir un Service à la clientèle très proactif, rapide à appréhender votre besoin et à y répondre avec un professionnalisme et une maîtrise hors pairs. Je me plantais dans l'installation d'un Bundle. Figurez-vous j'omettais de sélectionner un élément sans le réaliser (c'était une étape obligatoire) et c'est leur employé qui, au bout de la ligne, m'a amené à le réaliser. Mon problème était résolu, comme par magie ! Je recommande grandement cette application. C'est sûr, c'est efficace ! Il est excellent comme interface entre Shopify et Aliexpress. Vous ne serez pas déçu."
Does what I need it to - enact and display progressive discounts unobtrusively. Interface and customization options are good. Support helped promptly with an issue.
Very simple and easy to use interface. Support team was really helpful and fast. Great team doing great work. Keep it up.
Great app with very easy to use interface. Automatically works with my theme. Working great so far .
incredibly easy user interface and only takes minutes to set up. SO easy!
"This is the best app you could get. The interface is super user friendly and it provides you, full control and tons of benefits. The only time i had issues with my account i contacted ""Natasha"" who exceeded my expectations in every single way. The service provided by her its so excellent, personalized and proficient that it will provide an amazing customer service experience."
"Our favourite app so far! It’s allowed us to make the website a lot more informative whilst improving the user experience. It’s very intuitive and when you get lost, the customer service is exceptional."
Very good and efficient support. I highly recommend using it. the application is good and the interface is great !!!
"Pagefly is the best, I have been able to create really advanced pages within their drag and drop interface and have occasionally implemented custom coded for even more advanced functionality. And their customer support is amazing! I recently accidentally deleted a page i had spent a week working on and they quickly helped me recover it! Thanks guys, cheers."
Fantastic! Customer service is always top-notch! The interface is easy to use and offers all the tools to create a professional e-commerce store site design!
"When I was using this app, its interface was very good, so I could easily set up the window of the pop-up window. For a business like me, it is more convenient to collect the user's mailbox, and it is more perfect to have more. Many potential users, thank you very much for the developer of this app, this idea is really great."
"We have been using PageFly for some time. While we have enjoyed the interface, saved templates, and overall ease of use to fully design our Shopify pages, what has kept us as happy customers has been our interactions with Kate. She has worked very hard to help us overcome some technical issues we were having, and even though we have our own developers who could custom code pages with liquid, we continue to use PageFly because it is just so much faster! Great job to Kate and her team - thank you!"
We use the Privy-Exit Pop Ups & Email for our Canadian and USA storefront on Shopify. They have a very user friendly interface and I have not had any issues with the app to date. I do recommend it.
"First off, the support is phenomenal! I have never come across an app developer willing to help to the extent that Cross-Sell does. 
The app is extremely well thought out. The dashboard and user interface is very intuitive.  was up and running very quickly and I feel that the Cross-Sell app gives a highly polished look and feel to the site. Cross-Sell truly makes the eCommerce experience feel big league."
I like that this app is extremely user friendly.  The interface is very clean.  Also its built for beginners.
"We've been using In Cart Upsell since February, and our year-to-date batch shows a massive increase in items added before checkout. Hands down the best app I've ever used on Shopify. Easy interface, too.
Keep it mint!"
"Jus started with this and didn‘t understand really how to fix the codes in my Theme, Will answered direct, offered to help me and showed me exactly how and what to do.. 
Epic support from Will!  
Good interface also, set up my first upsell offer today :) 
This is one YOU HAVE TO HAVE! 
And the support is GREAT so no excuses not to jump right in!"
Extremely user friendly interface. Customising background and foreground colors in ads is a must have. Can't wait to see the results!
Great app! Clean interface. Does exactly what it claims to do and more.  Highly recommend this app to get you started collecting e-mails.
This app is fantastic. They helped me integrate into my theme and is very helpful in offering variations of my product. Very intuitive interface - well done Cross-Sell team.
Love it. Does everything I need. Easy to use interface and design templates let me customize to my hearts content.
Privy has gotten me a lot of extra revenue through the pop up exit intent bar. I just integrated it with Klaviyo and that will help as well. Great interface and easy to use app. This is a must have. You don't need any coding skills and you can create a variety of campaigns within the app.
"I am satisfied with the app, and they have very good customer support and an easy to use user interface"
"We have been using Cross-Sell for almost 2 years, and it has been performing beautifully. We love simple interface and how quickly it functions. When we recently had a minor layout issue, their customer service was super responsive. The problem was solved almost immediately. Highly recommend!"
"Firstly, the service is incredible. The support team is a small knit crew that really helps when dealing with recurring issues, and the team understanding who you are as a business. I've had several bugs, and they always get fixed in a matter of minutes. 
The app itself is robust, a must have for any serious merchant looking to offer an incredible user experience to its customers!"
awesome interface. i just now downloaded it we will see how well it works. the more the download the more we get promoted!
"Very impressed!  Stuart responded promptly and customized the style of the app to match my theme (free of charge, as promised).  The cross-sells look great.  On the backend, it's very easy to use.  The interface is intuitive, making it a breeze to set up new offers.  I've used other cross-sell/upsell apps and this tops them easily.
Only limitation is that the app won't work for cart upsells if your cart ""pops up"" or ""slides"", which mine does.  But for product page cross-sells, I have no complaints."
I liked the ease of use of the app. The interface was laid out in a way that I never struggled to get what I needed done.
"Great app, clean interface, easy to use, and surprisingly integrates well with other apps. So far I have no complaints, and the support has been great."
"Cross-Sell is an essential app and works wonderfully. Easy to use interface on the admin side. As for integrating the styling to match the website, customer service did a perfect job and went beyond what I expected to ensure that Cross-Sell was integrated seamlessly. Highly recommended!"
Fantastic app that does exactly what it says! The interface is simple and has many options that allows it to fit your needs. Their customer service is excellent for any questions that you may have.
"This app is excellent!  I needed the ability to customize my product pages and PageFly has given me the ability to design pages the meet specific needs of my products.  It's easy to organize and tailor content.  The user interface is very intuitive and you can make pages in minutes.
The app integration is a little limited.  I had to switch from apps that met my needs and had to forgo some functionality.  I chose the Loox and Wiser apps.  The integration was seamless.
I've had a wonderful experience with the PageFly support team who responded quickly and resolved my issues.  The entire experience was very friendly and welcoming."
"Great application, I really appreciate it's interface and customizable features. It's easy to use and several features."
"Probably the easiest way to fulfill orders on aliexpress. Quick to setup, fairly straightforward interface, REALLY quick support - actual 24/7, under a minute response times. Amber from their support team helped me with a technical issue in under 5 minutes."
"Cross-Sell provided the perfect solution for maintaining complete control over the recommended products area of my current shops. 
With close to 1000 products across 2 stores, I was concerned that this type of customization was going to take forever to implement. Not only did Cross-Sell provide a seamless integration into my existing theme, the full-featured back-end allowed me to bring both sites up-to-date in no time at all. Not only does the app perform as promised, but the User Interface makes the process of updating and amending recommended products an actual pleasure.
Combined with the amazing support offered by Steve, this is an app that will be  a fundamental component of all my future projects. Kudos, Steve, on creating a professional tool that offers incredible value at a price that is beyond fair."
"Absolutely love this app! After so many attempts with other apps that just didn't do the job and attempting to cross-sell products on my own with code heavy tutorials this app is just a dream! The interface is easy to work with, it looks great and works even better!
Steve is so hands-on and remarkably helpful! He helped me in a matter of hours with the installation when I had a strange error code appear. Then he perfectly matched the look of the promoted items with my website. Seamless!
Couldn't be happier!"
"Cross-Sell was very simple to use and gave me the ability to associate cross selling products manually with related products via an easy to use interface. Great for matching items from different collections. Team is also willing to tailor the look and feel of the cross-sell items to match your site. Very useful and affordable. Only small bemol, it is necessary to dedicate a bit of time to match all the items..."
"A lot of technical problems (form that don't display, slow javascript ...) no documentation on how to install it asynchronously. The interface is good and intuitive thouh"
"Seems to work well so far, just started using the app today. The interface seems pretty intuitive to this point."
"This app is best to do popup notification and easy to use, wonderful interface and easy to use for all"
"Have been using it for a month. Good interface, very flexible. Customer Support is outstanding!! they are always available, always nice and always knowledgable. I highly recomend!"
"Great app, easy to use, setup wizard helps you start running campaign in minutes. The interface is very user friendly."
The app interface is user friendly. Most important of all the customer service is top class. Recommended.
"Just wow! This is the third-page builder used and is incredible compared to the others. You have customization over virtually everything, the interface is simple, you can make product pages, and any other page with ease."
Great App really even the free vision it allows you to customise your user experience to help your customers.
I like the options and the interface easy to use it definetly explain better the information to abegginer like me
Easy to Install.  Straight Forward Design  Great Apperance.  Clean User Interface.  Multiple Support Videos Available
"OMG! This is finally the app I was looking for since weeks. I tried all the other apps since they were less expensive, but at the end of the road none could work flawlessly as this one! Problem with double listings, wrong SKU, products missing, images missing and no real link/sync between my Shopify and Etsy store, it was a nightmare! 
I'm now able to list products that I wasn't never being able to list before with other apps! I'm so delighted to have join Etsy marketplace integration! I was able to list my first items even without watching any tutorial since the app is very well done and the interface is really user-friendly! If you are serious about managing both shop fluently, this is the one! Furthermore, the customer service is top notch and are they are backing you all the way (thanks, Jason!)! 
Being able to sync everything is a real must for my business since the orders and listings are now really in link/sync together and the orders go now directly to the manufacturer without having to do that manually! A real time saver in both way and no risk of doing a typo when copying order information of the customers! Its really worth every penny!"
"As a total beginner I started designing and building up my store - after few attempts with several apps I got frustration from their user experience.
When I started using PageFly their support team (which available 24/7) basically help me build the whole store. You won't believe the result u are able to get with them - a high quality, professional site customize to your needs and vision."
"I just switched from Oberlo to Dsers and Dsers is just the best between both. - Supplier optimizer - Better user experience
- Good support (Thanks a lot for your quick answer Bruna!)"
"Pagefly is super easy to use to build a fully customizable page. The UI makes it simple. You don't need any experience to build a fully functional page. The interface has everything you'll ever need to make a beautiful site. Also, if you ever get stuck or don't know how to do anything, they're customer support is superb. They respond almost instantly and take their time to fix issues or help you as fast as possible. I'd highly recommend PageFly for building your site out."
¡Muy fácil de utilizar! Me gusta la ayuda que te brinda la misma interface. Es fácil de integrar al mobil también.
great app and easy to use. friendly user interface. everyone should try this app it make my life easier.
Really like the interface and it's making the process of ordering simple as it should be. Customer support is quick to react as well!
"Absolutely fantastic for syncing Shopify to Etsy! The app works like a charm, fast, reliable, very easy interface and saves you endless hours of manual work with few clicks.
I have tried using few other apps in the same category but this one is by far the best. No errors, just works without issues and makes your Etsy shop shine in minutes. 
Also I have to give credits to the best customer support I ever received from a Shopify app developer (and I've came in contact with many). All my questions solved in minutes. 
Must have, totally recommended !"
"this app is great, easy to use interface and is really great to me and my business of 2019. it is nice, provided a easy to use pop up"
Very smooth and easy to use! The interface is not complex so you won't be having a hard time. If you're a beginner I recommend you give it a try to gain some experience. Very eager to see how things will work out over time!
"This app is really to use. The interface is very user friendly and clear. I have not received results of the marketing yet because i just started using it, but I am excited to see how it does!"
Very easy interface. Friendly and helpful staff. I would recommend this app to a friend if they were to ask.
"Perfect app, really interesting for having a social proof in your website. The interface is really clear and usefull."
Great. Very clean interface and very easy to setup and use. I have not gotten much into it but will update the review as I see results
"Awesome app, really enjoyed the interface... easy to use!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"If only there were a 100 stars. One of the best satisfying apps I have ever used. price is very reasonable, the interface is amazingly PERFECT. what more can I say? I am blown away...
I should also mention the amazing support team, Aldwin, Cristian, Will, Ayrton & Jerry... those people are the professionals by all mean & the best in what they do, how they do it and how friendly each and every one of them is. Thank you so much. Don't look any further, this is the app!!!"
so far so good - I am using it to try and increase sales - the user interface is great which is good so far!
super easy onboarding! clean fast interface. does what i need it to do... without a whole lot of stuff i don't need.
"Easy interface, Good clicks, good increase in sales! Would differently recommend for someone trying to market on a budget!"
Good app - nice functionality and user interface. Free version is also good. Thanks - why is there a 100 char minimum?
"Excellent support, very quick response and accurate. The software interface is friendly and works as expected."
Outstanding app and a must have for Shopify users! The user interface is friendly. The popup designs could be better.
I have used quite a few page builders across multiple platforms and stores but with Pagefly their drag and drop interface and features are so easy to use. If you have any issues their live chat is super responsive and make all the effort to fix your issues. Would highly reccommend this app!
"We'd like to thank the privy team for a great app that is providing so much value. Able to turn traffic into lists which is what we wanted to do. Highly recommended, It has a clean crisp interface. Easy to setup and maintain. Cheers"
We've used this app to create a  small campain and it was very easy to use. great interface. Would use it again.
"Love the concept! Easy user interface, even for beginners like myself. I look forward to getting more quality traffic to my store."
I like the interface and the easy to use tools. It caters to the individual and wants to help gain you traffic. It helps you design your ads as well especially if your a beginner.
Easy to set up and use. Nice interface.
"I really like the user friendly interface of the app, it was very easy to setup. I am very excited about it and look forward to the results!"
Easy to use interface and the ad looks great. Excellent way to generate higher traffic to my site.
"Used this app to create a wheel spin exit intent campaign. The interface is really easy to grasp for beginners, so well done Privy team!"
"Shogun made my site-building on Shopify MUCH easier. As a brand-new Shopify user, I needed an app that would allow me to easily build a custom-designed site for my client. I was able to use existing HTML and plug it into the Shogun interface, while using the app's excellent styling functionality to minimize my CSS usage.
When I ran into problems along the way, the Shogun customer support was very friendly and extremely helpful, to the point of creating a test page on my site to look deeper into the issues and help me find ways to fix them and use Shogun better. 
HIGHLY recommend!"
"Quick response to a trouble I had but very effective answers. The design and the friendly user of the app is little hard to understand at first but with time you get use to it. So 5 Stars for the troubleshooting, 4,8 stars for the visual and friendly user experience. Thanks a lot!"
Simple and easy to use. Simple interface for first time users like myself. Provides very good insight.
"This application has a powerful user interface and lots of interesting features. 
However, it is incompatible with Rejoiner , maliciously altering email addresses sent to our external list . Do not recommend"
This App works perfectly. Within just an hour I was able to get 4 customers signed up. the User Interface is also straight forward
"All I needed, I got it!! User-friendly interface. I couldn't find my fonts, used on my store, but that's a small issue..."
"Finally, a super simple website builder for Shopify. It has a beautiful interface, and is so easy to use. If you know a little about CSS padding and margin, that also helps. It's not cheap, but worth the price for the freedom and control that it provides. It also saved me potentially thousands of dollars compared to hiring a ""Shopify expert"". I guess I'm actually saving money!"
"I've tried all of the editors available on Shopify, this one worked the best for me. In terms of features, interface, how easy and how flexible the design options are. And the best is the support team that replies to you immediately to any question (even if it's the most simple question like 'where is the menu that does...' ) thank you !!!!"
"Not a developer nor do I know any code. This app is so easy to use and allows tons of customization to match your home page, keeping the brand matching throughout the site! I would highly recommend this app to anyone that has an eye for design and wants to enhance the user experience."
"Love this app. We've made dozens of product detail pages and even our homepage with Shogun. The wysisyg interface works well and offers most options we need. For the few very customized configurations, the app allows you to easily add custom JS/CSS/HTML. Also the lazy-load on all images the site load faster. Great app."
Easy to use interface. Simple instructions and no extra stuff that you don't need. It's also super lightweight and the ads load fairly quickly.
"Shogun is super easy to use, the drag & drop interface is seamless and we especially love the Snippets section that allows us to design our pages with consistency. Support has been incredible!"
Excellent app! We used it to build out our landing pages. Very simple interface that was so easy to use we had them ready to go in one day!
This app has really helped me layout pages as I'd like (sans a Liquid developer) via a logical interface. And the customer support has been really helpful whenever I get stumped with something! Good stuff.
This app definitely helped me create more trust with my customers. I really like the interface and alle the options it comes with
"While Shopify is an all-around good e-commerce platform, you will need to find and install a different web development tool to create a really high impact, competitive  web site for your business. PageFly was that app for my business.  The Page Fly environment is intuitive with a drag and drop interface that enables you to create super rich features without writing a line of code. The PageFly dev team are adding new functions on a regular basis too. The integration with Shopify such as dropping in products or even entire collections saves a lot of time. There is a learning curve though I have been impressed with the responsive and professional support the PageFly team provides... They stayed on my concerns until resolved. Net, Shopify manages my header, footer, menu and product pages and all other page edits including my blogs are managed through PageFly."
Intuitive and easy to use interface allows me to quickly put together landing pages for my clients website.  Saves me so much time and effort and has all the tools needed to make any page I want to create!
"An incredibly helpful, straightforward app for Shopify page-building. Beyond the brilliant interface, the support staff go above and beyond. Randy in particular helped resolve a tricky question I had, taking the time to ensure it was resolved and easy to use. Thanks a million!"
"Very good looking interface. Still testing out. Will update review once I got more data, but very good for now!"
just started using great app. easy intuitive interface. recommend highly for any eCommerce platform
"Amazing page builder app with top notch, personalised support. The interface takes a while to get used to but once you do it's very easy to navigate and get high quality pages live within no time, without a developer"
"I used this app to learn how to advertise, since the platform is so good i think i will stay with this platform. i really like the easy to use interface. i look forward to the future development of the app. I enjoy the ease of use aswell!Great app! I like the credit exchange feature and the possibility to exchange ad space really love this concept"
"Switched to this app because I was having saving issues with Shogun. Really like the interface, and no software related issues thus far! Support is really helpful and provided screen recordings of any problem they fixed so I know how to do it for the future."
"Creating an ad was an simple process, I'm just giving it a test run now. Interface was easy to use."
I've used multiple page builder for shopify and besides the user friendly interface PageFly support is the best. I'm writing this now after support helped me to save hour of work and figuring out.
I am fairly new to webpage design building.  Shogun  made it easy to put the site together and create our website.  I tried other page builders but Shoguns easy drag and drop interface was the best one to get the site completed.   Their support team was extremely helpful.
"Muito bom !!! contém diversas funções, interface simples e com possibilidade de configurar do jeito que você desejar!"
Awsome! Truly great app. User friendly and the interface makes it all too easy to control. I would recommend it to anyone!
"Havent really had much time to review this, but from what I can see it serves a good purpose. I will edit my review once Ive used it for some time. User friendly interface and you cant go wrong with free."
"Great app! I like the interface and ease of use, hoping to get lots of traffic. I would like to use this app for many years to come, to better my store."
"A fantastic five star app! As a first time business owner this app was the catalyst for my growth. A great user interface made everything easy.
A++"
"Nice app, a lot of functionality, great interface. Wonderful app that is useful for any online store."
I used Privy to help with a quick pop-up. The interface was intuitive and made it easy to get something up in a pinch.
"I enjoyed using the app, the interface is easy to use and has a lot of options for layout construction. Also it has good templates for choosing. The support is great and can help you customize your needs"
I used this app for a pop-up window on my new Shopify store. The app is good but It still has room for improvement. I believe the user experience could be a lot smoother.
Privy is easy to install and use. Friendly user interface. Privy is easy to install and use. Friendly user interface.
So far the app seems amazing and easy interface to use really recommend this app its a shame that the free version has to have there branding tho other than that seems great so far.
"Very good user interface, easy to use, and a lot of features to boost sales. Customer support is excellent! Thank you PageFly team"
I used this app many times. I like the easy access and straightforward interface. Thumbs up! Highly recommended.....
"Great app, easy and intuitive interface. Their support team is great, take them on average 10min to answer any question you have."
I installed their previous version and was able to set it up without any problem. Upgraded to the latest version recently and my page stopped loading properly. I contacted support and and almost immediately got a reply from Touqir who sorted the issue within seconds... So far it seems that the newer version is even easier to use. i will update my review after I have played around with it more but so far I really recommend. I guess the fact that I am looking forward to further exploring the possibilities  with this app is a reflection of how attractive and easy the user experience/interface is.
"This app is super useful! A lot of ways to fulfill orders and super easy to do. Kind of confusing at first and lots of improvements could be done to make the interface more simple, but great overall. They have a chat setting that is always available and it is SO useful! I definitely recommend!"
Just install the app and under testing but love the friendly interface. hope this work well & can boost my sales. thank you.
Currently using the trial version and feel very positive about the app. The team is very responsive and super helpful. Plus the interface is very easy to use.
"EDIT:I had to downgrade this review. Full of bugs, broke my product page and the customer service is poor...Unless they are hassling you for 5 star reviews ;)
It's a really nice interface...just need fewer bugs, and customer service that doesnt suck.
Original Review:
This app has changed my view of Shopify! It's incredible! I moved over from Wordpress and this App has allowed me to build any style of landing page I can imagine.
No longer restricted to poorly made Themes - I can take a standard Theme and customize page designs using this app!
Good value, very easy to use (easier than any Wordpress builder) and great customer support."
"Muito bom. Não testei ainda, mas espero funcionar bem para conversão, mas parece funcionar bem, interface legal."
fiz a instalação e achei a interface bem legal.  Agora começar a usar e nos próximos dias ver direitinho como funciona.
"I really like this app! it saves a lot of time, easy to use interface as well! the new features keep on improving and updating. Most important is almost free for beginner which is the plus point to help small business and this make me willing to spend for pro and advanced plan as the business grow in the future. In addition, the customer services is top notch!"
"I've installed the app at nina-trade.com. Friendly interface, easy installation and making ad exchanges are for every compliment."
"logical layout and easy interface, and I've used many email building tools in the past, and this seems to be the real deal"
Easy to use and great for driving sales. The interface is really intuitive and user friendly. Helped me increase my conversions.
"I'd recommend Shogun to any marketer! We use it to create landing pages to compliment our SEO/SEM efforts mostly. Our developer was able to customize our landing pages to look exactly like our website for a seamless user experience. I'm sure you could get what you need without the use of a developer too, since its so easy to use and set up. We are so happy with Shogun and will continue to use it as we grow!"
Privy manages to provide complex features in an easily managed interface. Only took me minutes to get started.
"I am two days into the trial and here is my initial opinion.
I have a 3 month old professional gaming desktop computer and not running queer crap in the background, this app sucks up enough RAM that when I am editing text there is a 5 second lag.  I find it irritating but not damning.  
For the rest of the program, I have been playing with it for two days, re-invented a few of my landing pages and working on my home page and only time will tell on those but the interface is okay.  Some of the element boundaries are super close so to be able to choose between certain close boundaries can be tricky (like between a group box and the column box).
In general so far, I like it but, if you are working with an older slower computer full of background programs you might get really frustrated with the lag (I know that whenever you are changing something in a drag-and-drop program, as you go it is re-writing the code - hence the lag).
I researched these type of apps and found that for the start-up plan costs it is a good start, just be patient. 
If anything changes I will update my rating :)"
"Shogun's an incredibly useful toolbox, the interface is extremely user friendly, would definitely recommend, and I generally hate everything! :D"
Pretty easy to use interface. Many niches to choose from. Just implemented it into my store and will see how well it works.
It’s good. mobile interface needs improvement. Why is there minimum 100 character limit? .............
"Had issues with the drag n' drop interface, which was super frustrating. 
But, thanks to the folks over at Shogun for being super responsive and going as far as collaborating on resolving the issue.  Thanks again."
"Excellent app! Easy to use, intuitive interface. The best solution to have a stylish blog on Shopify. Fast and efficient support.  Highly recommend!"
This app was really easy to use. It has a really easy to read interface that makes coordinating the application easy.
Great user experience for my customers. Instant email list to grow my shopify store. Recommended to everyone!
"I couldn't be happier with the Shogun app!  It has a very easy and intuitive interface which is both a pleasure and a relief!  As a solo founder who's never built a site before, this app has made it possible for me to create exactly the look and layout I want, without having to engage a developer at all! I've saved a TON of time and money using this app and am so happy the team at Shogun has taken care to build such a quality product!!"
Easy to use interface and helpful support if you ever get stuck! Simple to get a page looking great!
Adding Shogun's page builder app is like adopting Wix's and Shopify's love child (aka its awesome as heck). The interface is super easy to use drag and drop editor. The tools it gives you allows you to build pretty much anything. Customer service is on top of it too.  Highly recommend. Though I do wish it wasn't so expensive to add product pages—can't have it all I guess.
"Very good app to create great pages! Need some time to get used to the interface.
The support team is very professional and solve issues quickly."
Took me a little time to get the hang of the interface but now I am able to create more visually interesting blogs than I was with the native Shopify blog creation tool. So far support folks have been very professional and have resolved my issues within 24 hours.
Super app! Ça rajoute tout ce qui manque au layout très restreint de Shopify. En plus ils font des updates et tout l'interface est vraiment user friendly. Je la recommande fortement.
Easy to use user friendly interface free of cost and helps to grow your business with ease just sign up
I like the dashboard but I still need to see how it works on my website. I hope that it works out well for me. I seems like an easy to use interface.
Excellent app. Easy to use and very friendly interface. Recommend it for anyone who does not know how to code (like myself)
I really like how intuitive the interface is.  I’m hoping for the best!  It seems like a well thought out app design.
"The best app of the Shopify for building landing pages, best interface, best customer service, all of good! Thank you very much!!"
i have been looking for such app since long and finally found it. it has an amazing interface and such user friendly features. great work team
"I've been very impressed with Shogun.  I had never worked with Shopify pages and .liquid programming before so it allows me to build really nice, custom-designed pages in Shopify that I wouldn't be able to do with just a store-bought template.  It's pretty easy to learn and the interface is nice and clean.  I think as it grows and matures as an app it will get even better.  I'm looking forward to more features as the come out. Most of all I have to give it up to the support team of Shogun.  They have been very courteous with me during my numerous questions to them.  They are also FAST at solving and/or finding alternate solutions to the issues that I contact support about.  A lot of companies have terrible support, but with Shogun you get the feeling that they actually CARE about you and the issues at hand. A great experience so far.   I hope it continues!"
"This is the best visual editor of the top three rated that I tried. It has the best support by far, the most easy to use interface, and is stable. Got my pages up and going in a day. Had questions as I went and got responses within a few hours. All features I needed are working great. Highly recommend this app over all other visual editors including Gems (horrible service and my pages kept disappearing)."
Pretty good. Interface could be more convenient and minimal but other than that it's an okay platform.
"I have just started using this app but i do like it so far. The interface is user friendly, and easy to use."
Easy Set up Hope it works well Very easy set up very clean user interface very easy to set up campaigns
Easy Set up Hope it works well Very easy set up very clean user interface very easy to set up campaigns
"We are using this app to implement an entirely new user experience for our website which portrays our original business vision. I'm honestly not sure how people can get confused or leave bad reviews on this app. It's a great code injector for when you don't want to write your own responsive code (it saves time quite a bit of time.) I wouldn't listen to any negative reviews, it seems more like user error to me from my personal experience using it over the last couple of weeks."
"Great App / Add-On to our Shopify store. It lets us create pages in several minutes without coding (but if you want you can add custom code snippets).
Really beautiful new interface, clean and fund and easy!!
Nice team and support!"
"Thanks to Shogun, we can elevate our site experience without paying for pricey customizations. Shogun helps us build pages on the fly, including landing pages, category pages, journal articles and more. 
As a retailer focused on helping women discover new brands, it's important for our products to be represented with A+ content and visual design. More importantly, we curate products in ways traditional navigation does not support (yet). Shogun enables us to build really cool curated pages that tell a story, which helps our platform acquire new customers. 
As a boot-strapped startup, tools like Shogun make it possible for us to grow faster by giving us the freedom to design (and test) exceptional user experiences without the high cost of customizing our Shopify theme."
I use this app to help generate more traffic to my store.  I like the concept of an ad exchange versus paid traffic.  I recommend this app. I enjoyed the user friendly interface and being able to customize fonts.
Excellent App! Quick and Easy way to spruce up Shopify and turbocharge user experience. I love it! can't wait to see this pay off!
Comprehensive and easy to use user interface. I anticipated this app to work well and it indeed delivers.
I'll give it a try. It's video is very well done and their interface too. But at the moment it seems cool!
"I use PageFly for 2 Weeks now and it´s amazing how I understand it better every day. It´s so easy to learn although it has so many different functionalities. Such a good user interface! You can pretty much do whatever comes to your mind. Every time I´m having a question or don´t know how to build a specific part, I contact the support and they help me immediately with such a patience and endurance, it´s amazing! I really really can recommend this app!"
This app is great and easy to use. I love the interface of it all. Emails are captured with ease and its exports them as well. Awesome app highly recommended.
"Amazing application, create tool to create non-template pages.  Good support and services. Would definitely recommend.
The application is very easy to learn and use if you are comfortable with the shopify admin interface"
"Very nice page builder. Love it. Easy interface, a Nice video tutorial with a clear concept. Very active customer service."
Really easy to use. Simple interface and guide to assist you with your marketing plans.  Would greatly recommend this
"Tried another page builder and gave up.  Then I I started with Shogun's Landing Page builder and recently upgraded to the Blog and Collection Page plan. Highly recommend: Shogun has an intuitive interface that is easy to learn. Their pages are SEO friendly unlike SOME page builders and Shogun's support has been excellent with prompt, clear responses.  They run their business like I run mine - a quality product with 100% customer support.  Thanks!"
"This app is easy to implement, almost in no time at all, through an easy interface my email signups were up and running."
"Easy to use, nice interface, almost all setup. So far I like it! It does ask for a review too quickly tho..."
Ótimo aplicativo interface bonita e fácil de usar vou colocar na minha loja agora pra testar a taxa de conversão! Aposto que vai aumentar kkkkkkkkkk
"Love this app...great help for anyone starting out with dropshipping..
easy to use and very intuitive interface making fast ads for your shop this can really help alot of people."
Shogun has been an incredible tool for our company to create and share visually pleasing content with our customers and followers.  Very easy to use interface that delivers an excellent final product!
That is a must-have app for anyone who wants to customize Shopify themes without coding or hiring developer. Its very easy to familiarize with its interface and any question you have will lead you to discover the best of this app: the AMAZING customer support. Thank you for building such a useful app and for your help !
Thanks for such an easy interface. We are using this from last two months and get lot of value out for the business.
its nice app with nice features but needs work on user-friendly I see people having trouble with the interface.
"This app has been nothing less than a life-saver, it is SO easy to use and the customer service is extremely knowledgeable and helpful. They have a help button in the bottom corner and someone usually responds right away, and it is a real person, not an automated app. Shogun has allowed me to customize pages in ways my Shopify theme was not capable of, and I am eternally grateful for this, as it allows us to really give a better user experience and control layout much easier. Without Shogun, our site would not be as effective! Thank you! (shout-out to Charles and Jill in customer support for always being there and helping me with any issues!)"
Great app! very responsive customer service--amazing functionality and user interface. SHould have used this a long time before
"Great so far, running my first ad campaign now so I will update later. The interface is simple to use and imports your products."
"This app is good for two reasons:
1. There's a lot of functionality within the tool that allows the user to have one simple interface from which to create. 
2. The customer support is quick to chime in when you use the chat feature.
I'm only giving it four stars because I haven't launched my site LIVE yet. I'll save my last star for when we launch. Otherwise this is a great app so far!"
"So far, after figuring out the interface, this has been my ""go-to"" for when I want to create a new page (of any kind) for my site.  It's straight-forward, drag and drop.  It allows you to create 100% mobile-friendly pages.  Live chat support is great!  Just got done with Sami, and they helped me with a couple of issues right away.  They even created a video specifically for me to help solve one of my issues.  If you're looking for an improvement over the Shopify page creator - this is it."
"A powerful app! And a lot better than others in every aspect, price, customer service, user interface. I cannot recommend this enough!"
"5 star for a customer service and to Sami who helped me a lot. To be honest it was really hard to understand the interface and change something, plus you see it one way on the page builder, and on the actual page it's different... But the guys did a great job and helped me with understanding the interface and making my new page look pretty."
"WORKS GREAT, LOVE THE APP AND INTERFACE. HAVE USED ON MULTIPLE STORES! PLENTY OF FREE FEATURES AND WE'VE GOTTEN MANY SUBSCRIPTIONS"
"This app delivers, 5 out of 5 from the boss. easy to use interface with  good amounts of traffic. I would recomend"
"At a time where we had to get a new site up quickly and professionally, Shogun was the product we chose for our website and it got the job done quickly and easily!
Interface is easy to use and intuitive, they provided answers whenever we needed them and were always quick to reply.
I recommend highly!"
"Shogun, is an incredible app. I have used it now for the past 3-4 months. designing pages is easy and very fluid. The app also includes the ability to roll back your design should you decide that a prior version out was out-performing an updated page- THIS IS HUGE! Page creation can take as little as 10 minutes if your're an experienced user and you have the ability to create a top-tier experience all from a drag and drop interface. A definite must have when you need to make the best impression with visitors to your site."
"I was looking for apps and methods to reduce ad costs and app by Varinode just fit my bill perfectly. I suggest you to install Ads by varinode because of three advantages it has: 1. Easy To work with: clean interface, create an ad in 2 minutes or less. 2. Thousands of stores have installed it: you are not alone, more stores install it more platforms you get to display ads. 3. Free: Free to install no conditions. Free is always best."
"This app has taken my page to the next level and it is so easy to use. 
I was able to really enhance the design and the user experience without having to mess around with code. I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to customize their design to the fullest. 
The customer service is also spot on and such a quick reply."
Love it! Just started working with this builder and I am highly impressed so far. Clear video guides show you how to work with the interface. Really well built and easy to use once you take the time to practice with the tools. I look forward to more functions becoming available!
"Great product, the drag and drop interface is great for landing pages and product detail pages."
"Very easy to use, the editing effect of the interface is very good. I hope the price will be better."
"Started using Privy last week. Used to have JustUno but we like Privy more, easier interface, easily linked with MailChimp and all kinds of popup just look & work better."
"Really easy to use interface, quick and helpful support. Great drag and drop page builder if you want to build a page that looks good quickly without any need for coding experience."
Very good and user-friendly interface. Use it for my store and very happy with all the results which I got from it
"Love it. been using it for a month and even though the interface wasn't always very intuitive at first, i got the hang of it and created an awesome landing page for my product."
"Overall, I would say this app is definitely useful. The interface between the editing section and what is published is a little glitchy, but their customer service is great and can usually solve the issue on their end/ explain how to solve the issue in the editing section. 
There are free, pro and premium subscriptions, but you start off with a free trial period that can be 'extended' by doing various things (publishing one of the pages you create on PageFly as your Homepage, for example). After the trial period, you can still use/edit a pro/premium template if it was selected during the trial."
"Completely redesigned our homepage and landing pages with this app, great interface, intuitive and the results are everything you would want them to be."
Pretty easy to use. Just waiting to see if the results match up to the ease of use with the interface.
"I used Autoketing apps before and was very happy with functionality and performance but this is by far the best app of theirs I have used, it is easy to use with a clean interface and plenty of options to tailor to all your business needs. It is well worth a download as it can help to boost conversion rates. All in all a pretty well built app."
"App is very easy to use, very fast interface. Can you cashback and do not change product ID on Shopify which is very helpful for who use Google Ads."
"I like how easy it is to setup ads with a similar Adwords interface.
I've started to get sales almost within the first 24 hours of using this!"
"Very good application, easy to use and easy to configure. The interface is very user friendly. The support very helpful"
"Great App! At first I had to take some time to get used to how this app and interface work. Once you get the hang of it, it's easy to build a website. I experienced a few technical glitch and difficulties, but their customer service is great! Particularly, Vian is amazing!! I feel that I have a personal assistant on building my website. The only downside was wait time, which varies depending on the availability of the customer reps. However, considering the price plan (pro version), tutorial instructions and pre-built templates provided by Pagefly, it's worth getting a Pro version. Amazing!"
"I began to use this as a way to get traffic started for my new store. Now I can see it can have long-term benefits and will be central to my advertising. I love the easy and quick interface. No wasted time, just effective ads."
Parece cumprir bem o que promete. O app tem uma interface simples de se trabalhar e com possibilidades.
"This app is AMAZING! Totally love it! I actually chose to use Shopify because they have the Shogun plugin to build pages easily and quickly. The interface for this app is easy and fast to use, no coding required. It has a lot of options and it builds responsive code that looks nice on desktop and mobile screens. Customer support is so fast, they reply within one hour usually with all of the answers to your questions. New features are being added all the time, it's such an exciting thing to be able to build a custom site/store without any knowledge of coding, HTML, CSS. And with the Shopify platform to back it up, you've got a top notch solution. Price is really reasonable, I gladly pay it because this app is so worth it!"
"After years in the design and web industry we needed an app that made it possible for our non developer staff to design and create beautiful pages in our shopify store. This app is absolutely excellent, one of the best apps I have seen yet on any platform. Sad to say, I almost never leave reviews for anything, but with this one, I feel compelled to, I have to say emphatically this app is simply awesome. Hands down the best choice for anyone wishing to create great looking pages without having to know a lick of code. Great work guys! Genious!” Interface!"
"Very difficult to use and most of the good templates and features are on the pro version, which is not free. They need to work on the user interface to make it more intuitive. I shouldn't have to spend 10 minutes trying to add a simple picture.
Edit #1: 
Sellersmith (the creator) contacted me after my first review and convinced me to give it another try. After spending some time with it I'm learning how to use the app better. It still could use some work on the intuitiveness side. It has a bit of a learning curve. But it's not a bad app. No coding, so that's awesome! 
It definitely is capable of a lot. It's just not always easy to figure out how to use it. The good templates are still on the paid version. But it's not too expensive. And if you decide to switch back to the free version you can keep the pages you already built (so they tell me). So that's cool. I'm going to keep using it for now and see how it goes.
Edit #2: 
I’ll let this be my final update. I’ve been working with this app for about a week now and the best way to summarize it is: It gets the job done. But not smoothly.
Basically it has a lot of features and capabilities, but it’s like pulling teeth trying to get them to work. I’m fairly tech-savvy and I’ve got some graphic design experience and I struggled to get this app to work. I have to take frequent breaks from using it because it’s so frustrating.
Simple actions that should be quick and easy like moving a piece of text from one part of a page/section to another takes a solid 10 minutes to figure out and requires deleting and inserting and moving and all kinds of work-arounds. And there’s really no reason it shouldn’t be a simple drag and drop. The developers need to place their app next to ones like PowerPoint and emulate them. Simplify tasks so that they don’t require a whole process to accomplish. 
At the end of the day (week) I got a couple of nice looking pages made. But boy was it challenging. The program is effective, but not intuitive. It has some bugs (like pressing the “undo” button once and having it leap 12 steps back). But I’ll keep it for now because it’s free. If it cost money I wouldn’t keep it. It’s not worth the headache and I’m on a tight budget. But for a free app it’s a pretty good deal."
"I've tried a few landing page apps and out of all of them Shogun was my final pick: 
Why? 
A) Easy to use and to get to learn - Shogun functions on a ""Box"" Model just like HTML and CSS.. Having a little bit of experience in how HTML works, really makes shogun intuitive from the start. 
There's no ""100% Intuitive"" landing page creator - but out of all of them, I was able to figure out shogun very quickly in comparison with some of the other top apps - which attempted to create a easy to use interface, but fell short. 
If I was not able to start designing from the start, I just deleted them. Shogun was the last one standing in that sense. 
The way that they designed the app is really well thought out in my opinion. 
2) Lots of control - While I'm on the basic plan - I fully intend on upgrading once i start making more money to get the full scope. 
Mind you these perks are more for ""advanced"" landing page design skills and are only relevant to people who need more advanced control over code - 
If you are a complete newbie, I wouldn't even recommend the advanced plans, since you wouldn't use any of those features. Although they are useful, they did a really good job separating user types from ""click and drop users"" to ""I want to customize the code myself"" 
3) As a new person on shopify, I did not know which app to pick. With 14 days free trial, you really don't have anything to lose and it gives you more than enough time to get to know the app. 
5/5 Stars!! Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!"
"Just installed this app for our new shop, interface looks intuitive, so far so good. Can't wait for the results!"
Highly recommend. Interface is super easy to work with (unlike Shopify's built-in page editor) & their customer support is beyond efficient. Would have left Shopify if not for this app.
"One of the best shopify apps to build pages. The user interface is super simple and innovative at the same time. 
As a new start-up business, this app really helped me get everything up and running. Without this app I wouldn't have been able to make my first sale.
Thank you so much!"
"I've used this app for about 5 years, and I've gone from my original 5-star review, to a 3-star review, to a 1-star review. The quality has deteriorated for this app as they've added features, creating new glitches, without improving the fundamental core features that you actually need in an app like this. The support is fast and friendly, but this company needs to just focus on the fundamentals and make a better user experience while actually using the page builder."
Easy and friendly user interface. Sufficient basic stuff in the free plan for beginner use. lovely experience
Excellent interface options. Simple to use and very prompt support
"Once you get to grips with the interface, this app is amazing, just take the time to learn the basics and Pagefly will do the rest, shopify layouts can be built from scratch with this, any questions just ask support, they are very quick to get back to you, and always helpful."
"Really great app, I would recommend it.
Some things to look out for are:
User interface can be a little clunky, but once you get used to it you can do great things.
EDIT: 
Upgrading to 5 Star rating, support is very helpful and was immediately available even to a currently Free customer such as myself.
These guys are serious about their customer service.
If anyone is trying to use the Auto-Responder, you will have to replace your shopify Newsletter Sign-Up form with the Privy one.
There are articles on how to do this that were linked by the very helpful support.
Keep improving Privy, it's great so far!"
Their 10-day shipping to US was a deal breaker and interface is really easy to use and very simple. Great customer service as well.
"Out of all the apps that I currently use on my store, this makes the most sense. Backend interface is outstanding, easy to setup and offer many customization options. I think every Shopify store should have this.
Kudos!! team Autoketing"
Super easy interface to use. I watched the videos to get familiar quickly about how to get started. The videos are really important to learn how to set up your landing page. I started from a template and customized it to my needs. Quick and really nice support from Nick!
"Shogun is awesome! It has allowed me to easily customize my site that otherwise would have had a very cookie cutter look and user experience. When I reached out to Shogun for a customer support question, I got a very speedy response from a co-founder who solved my inquiry right away, on a weekend no less. Awesome app guys!"
Such a tremendous interface and very powerful. Great work. Support is also brilliant.
"I really like this apps, i use for my store to create trust to my client, Thanks for the apps. Great app! Well done!!
Greate interface, very easy to install and configure, i think it’s extremely clever apps. highly recommend."
"Love this app and we've been trying to get used to it, doesn't know the outcome yet but the interface is so friendly."
"Started using Shogun for our blog posts, and we are in love. Super friendly interface, with drag-in blocks that make the development process very enjoyable. 
Thanks to everyone behind Shogun!!"
"Responsive.  Professional Interface.  Does what it says.  
A great find to work with!"
First time user but the interface is so user friendly.  I have good faith in this app
"Flexible, powerful and easy to use. I was in a jam and needed a pretty page I never could have made directly in Shopify, so I grabbed Shogun, and got it done in a day. I'm not a natural with this stuff, but the interface is very intuitive AND when I ran into a jam, someone hopped right on the phone with me and walked me through it, it was amazing!"
As per my first experience in Dropshipping I think I took the best decission by using Dsers. Great interface and easy to use and learn. Thanks!
"Just had a day with this app and already we have new email subscribers.
Nice and easy interface, great so far."
Easy app to use to start capturing and building email list. The interface was very intuitive as well.
Awesome app really working great haven't used yet but loved the interface.. i would love to see it working.
"Fantastic software for non coders, you can build beautiful professional looking pages using their designer and its friendly user interface. Great customer service too."
"The team at Shogun is nothing short of amazing.  I can't believe how easy it is to stylize and customize elements.  I have used other programs to play with how I like my pages, blogs, and products to look and none of the interfaces are as intuitive as this program.  When I didn't understand how to execute a complex task, I e-mailed the support team to ask them about my ideas.  Not only did they brainstorm with me to help, but they created examples, sent me combinations of video tutorials, and provided detailed explanations of my next steps.  Best of all, they didn't laugh at my lack of coding knowledge and were very patient with me during questions I had that were difficult to explain over an e-mail.  I am so happy to be using this app for years to come and I highly recommend it to any shop owner whose favorite thing to do is stylize their shop elements!"
"Very good gadget, good experience, can bring a good user experience to my website，Strongly recommend it!"
"The interface is intuitive, the platform is powerful, the ability to customize all pages is a major upgrade to a typical template, and support is quick and accurate. Five stars for sure."
"The app is easy to use, it has an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, and it is very flexible. It is exactly what I needed to give my pages the look I was after. Support is also great, I had something in my theme that needed tweaking for a video to work properly and I received quick response and fix. 5 stars on every level! www.axistango.com"
"Awesome app!
I can achieve almost everything I want using Shogun.
The interface is super easy to learn, almost intuitive, and the snippet tool comes in very handy when designing the website."
"good experience so far so good.
smooth interface with all the best tools that are very much easy to use"
"The best Shopify app ever created. The developers are constantly improving functionality and the overall user experience.   Honestly, we consider Shogun the most important app in our marketing arsenal and will continue to rely on it as our go-to page builder and website design tool."
"There is not much I can add to previous reviews. I can reiterate this is one of the best apps I have used. I do more Wordpress than Shopify.  I had convinced my client to buy a high end theme because there was not the budget for a custom coded Shopify site. The theme's home page was well designed and had several options but  I was surprised how bland the rest of the layouts were. I have a technical background but was not very familiar with either Liquid or the Shopify interfaces. This app allowed me to customize the site and avoid the $100.00/hr Shopify expert fees.
Not only is this app is great for someone who does not know much html, css (or sass) -it is timesaver for someone like me - it puts my design/development into power mode. I appreciate how they structured the UI - there is nice feature where you can add a class to your component. 
 Also their support is fantastic. I admit I did not read the documentation or look at the videos - at first. I would send them email that blah-blah was wrong and they would politely inform me what the issue was. 90% of the time it was my error.
Next time, I will not bother buying a high end theme."
"What a relief it was to discover Shogun! Creating new pages for our store is so much easier now, and the app works exactly as it is meant to. The drag & drop interface makes a big difference, and there is real potential to dive in deeper if that's what you are into.
Support from the Shogun team is also exceptional, with fast responses and friendly advice both during initial setup and also when encountering a few quirks particular to our store.
Highly recommended - this app has saved us both time and money and we look forward to continuing with Shogun well into the future."
Easiest way to create responsive pages/content for your store! Simple drag and drop and intuitive interface... GET IT!
So far so good. App has very easy interface to create the pop up you want. has lots of different options for campains. I havent touched anything for the email side yet thought.
I enjoy this apps interface. Enough ability to justify for a pro but easy enough for a newbie. Also functions as it is intended
The interface looks good but haven't started campaigns yet as need to review before it allows. As such 3* as really unable to review at this stage.
"So far I  just started using the app and haven't launched a full ad word campaign yet however the interface is nice, easy to use and strait forward. Excited to see the results."
I'm using this app as an interface between my shopify store and AliExpress. It really works fine and if there are any problems the support team always helps with great patience - even on weekends.
This has really helped me with getting my company name and store on google. Would recommend for use. Easy interface and quick set up with great results.
I stared using this app right away. Friendly interface. Tried couple of earlier but this app gives an amazing back end to put everything you want at front end.
"Design is good but my shopify customers would have terrible user experience  if we choose the free plan. Tried signup campaign. The gray privacy label out of window and the fixed 10% OFF window are ruining user's shopping experience. I wish there were pics upload function here so every1 can see them. 
You can do better, privy."
"Very impressed with this app so far - very thorough and professional interface, and the range of options certainly give peace of mind."
"UPDATE: Carlos and Jose have both contacted me telling me that I actually made the mistakes that resulted in such poorly designed, poorly written ads. Then they asked me to re-download the app with premium freebies in exchange for changing my review. 
I spent time with the set-up, entered custom text and made selections in each field. The app just simply did not save my data and as a result made really bad google ads.
I suggested that they both focus on fixing the errors in their interface rather than trying to convince intelligent customers that they're wrong. 
ALERT: When you delete the app from your store, they still have Manager access to your AdWords account.  Be sure to remove their access separately.
__
The banner ads do not look good, they look terrible in fact. The banner ads feature a font that is really stylized and hard to read. There are typos in nearly every ad; banner, display, search, text, etc - ""Quality"" is misspelled as ""Qaulity"". The ad text is generic, pulled from Google categories - so some of the search ads have the phrase ""Arts & Entertainment"" for my products which are coffee mugs and coasters. I'm not really even sure how that mistake happened. As a personal preference I didn't like that some ads ended with the phrase ""satisfaction guaranteed"" which does not apply directly to retail gifts and souvenirs. I only let the ads run for one day (it asks for 4 weeks to learn, which is fair) but I had 11,100 impressions and only 49 clicks. That's a .44% click through rate, which is absolutely terrible. It just verifies what other reviewers are saying - these ads do not get ""qaulity"" clicks or customers to your site because the ads themselves are not ""qaulity"". I did much better creating Google Ads on my own. I understand that the service was free, but the terrible ad spend was not."
"This app is seriously the best, it is relatively new which is the only reason it is not the most popular app on the entire app store.  Great customer service, interface it's pretty much the whole package for any store at any level."
"The app seems to work well and has a well designed interface for backing up. We have not tried a restore yet, but app appears professionally made and shows a breakdown of each type of item backed up separately. This is a good app for some security."
"Thumbs up from me, early days but brill interface, very easy to use"
"Must have app - great interface and simple to use, top service too. Rewind has saved our bacon in our fly fishing store more than once!"
"I love it! There is a little bit of a learning curve but once you get a hang of the interface, you can really create some awesome lead magnets and set up good automation. Would definitely recommend!"
Very easy to set up with a great user interface that is straight to the point
A good way to show your traction. Liked the interface and overall experience with the application.
"What do you like best?
Privy is the best platform that you can use to grown your list. It's easy to use and have a very intuitive interface. The customization is really fast and easy, to reach your needs at the best. I also like the reporting section in wich you can see how your performances are.
What do you dislike?
It's great and complete but Privy have some feats that you will never use, and maybe you pay to have one interesting feature and four that you'll never use. Would be great to pay as the feats you need.
Recommendations to others considering the product
You will be not disappointed by it.
What business problems are you solving with the product? What benefits have you realized?
As I already said I think that Privy is the best growing list software that you can find out there. It helps me to capture hundreds of emails every month, especially for clients that need to have a good email-base for their business. Also it saves my time because I can create a campaign in minutes, setting all the things I need."
"Awesome! I like the interface, along with the easy setup! will continue using it, i really like it yeah"
I really like this app because it help me on helping people remind of your product or something that need to be post yet sometimes people don't realize that. With good interface and great design. RECOMMENDED !!!
"Easy set-up. Interface is good, but could use better customization options."
Useful app and friendly interface
"Very happy, the support service is really fast and good. The interface of the app is easy to understand and does exacly what you want."
"the best popup app that you can find on the Shopify store!
great customer service and convenient interface!"
One of the most essential app to get on my shop. The interface is Intuitive and  time saved is unvaluable.
"Easy to use interface, awesome!"
We are using this app since almost 6 months and everything is great so far. It works fast and saving us lots of time fulfilling orders with a click or two. Has a user-friendly interface and the developer guys have prepared lots of help and how-to documents or videos. Big positive is that it’s fully free regardless of how many orders you fulfill. Can also real-time chat with the technical support team during office hours if any assistance needed.
"Great App for business owners who use Ali Express and shopify. A better , faster alternative to Oberlo. Support team are great and the user interface works really. Well . Would like to see features in the future such as profit and expense charts and supplier chat which would be awesome. thanks guys"
"Easy interface, lots of options for products to show as well as many different sub categories to narrow down your products"
"Good App.  Easy to use and streamlined.  Good integration into your Shopify store and good thing is that it's free to use with the bells and whistles.
Clean interface"
Easy Interface and free credits help.No results so far
Such a great interface and really makes the process of fulfilling orders a breeze! Definitely recommend and will continue using for the long run!
"Makes work so much simpler and quicker. Love the App. The interface could be a bit more friendly, takes a bit of getting used to."
"Just installed the app and managed to have campaigns under review in 5 easy steps and 15 minutes.
Didn't need to log in to Adwords at all. Everything is on Clever interface"
"I Used this app to help boost my sales and thats exactly what happened. Nice App, good interface,,,,,"
"O Dsers tem um interface ótima, prática de usar. Tudo fica organizado e agiliza o trabalho do Dropshipping. #Recomendo"
"Very easy to setup and produces better ad setup based on your actual product categories rather than winging it. Fills the gaps in Google interface, which provides little or no guidance regarding developing the content for ads."
"I was trying to check my options with suppliers so I stumbled upon DSers. I think the various steps to importing products is a bit hassle haha other platforms allow you to do this in a few clicks so like the number of steps with this one as opposed to the others kind of made me lose interest.
Also it kept on showing 404 error and I tried refreshing so many times, but still no luck. A bit disappointing, hopefully user experience can be improved!"
"I really like this app. I have just started my ecommerce store. Advantages: free plan, simple interface, integrations with other email marketing platforms"
"This app is very easy to use, an amazing interface, some great plans for subscribtion. I recommand this app !!!"
"really good app, it helped me to increase my sales very well
Very nice pop-up's design, and user-friendly interface
                                                        !"
"No brainer.  Easy to use, simple and most importantly FREE!  Clean interface and non-resource hogging.  Keeps my site fast, and quickly adds instant social proof to my new site.  On top of that there are plenty of customizations and design changes you can make.  Many thanks."
"4 stars because it's not the most intuitive interface, but it is working well on my site. so far so good."
"Great Set Up, easy to use interface, customizable in all aspects, and Free! what more could you ask for?"
"Perfect!
Undoubtedly the best integrator, dynamic interface, transparent and easy to use even for those starting out on dropship. Thanks to those involved Dsers"
"Undoubtedly the best integrator, dynamic interface, transparent and easy to use even for those starting out on dropship. Thanks to those involved Dsers"
"This application is Amazing! This is the best app for Dropshippers. Easy to use, convenient interface, a lot of features. Fast Customer Support! 
Recommend 100%!
BigBuys.co"
"Very simple and easy to understand interface. As an official Aliexpress order fulfillment partner, I am confident that Dsers will work to make your app continually the best for Shopify."
"Very simple and easy interface to understand. As the official Aliexpress partner for fulfilling orders, I am confident that Dsers will work to continuously make their app the most optimal for Shopify dropshipping.  5/5"
Way easier than expected! Hopefully I get the conversion I need! Very easy interface and not too many options to drown the user
This app is a game changer. It's like switching from a horse to a car. I couldn't go back. The interface is easy to use and it saves me so much time !
"Got up and started with this easy-to-use app in just a few minutes. Really loving the interface and templates so far, looks promising!"
"VERY USER FRIENDLY! very simple and clean interface, easy to use, will recommend to other Shopify users."
"Reidopromo
Excellent application I tested and loved totally uncomplicated interface and easy to control recommend to all who download the app dsers ..."
"This app is the best to manage the orders of your online business. I highly recommand it ! It's so fast and the interface is very clear, even for  beginners. I can't wait to gain access to Dsers PRO.
No doubt : it's a 5 stars for me !"
"So far so good, easy to set up and easy to use interface"
"Pleasure using this App.  Easy interface, seems to work well!"
"Very easy to set up.  Results remain to be seen yet, but the interface was very user friendly."
Intuitive interface with great customer service
"Awesome app so far, very clean interface!"
"I still cannot tell if it is working or not since I'm an eCommerce noob.. but I like the interface & how it runs so I'm gonna recommend it for ppl who know how to play with Shopify apps!
(Just in case it isn't working for me; don't hesitate to check out my site to ""ensure"" it is working =D)
www.Anasito.com"
Exactly what I was looking for. Very easy to use interface with a lot of customizeable options! Happy happy!
Excellent app. Unique idea and very easy to use interface. Would recommend to anyone with a Shopify store; especially if you are struggling with managing ad budgets. A great traffic boost for any store.
"No way to edit a campaign once you've submitted it. I've been using adwords for awhile, and thought I would give this app. However, unlike Adwords, there is no way to edit an ad after you've submitted the ad. If you try, you reach a screen that says ""your ad is processing"", etc etc. 
The real adwords interface allows you to see all of your campaigns and ads, even the ones that are in review. That way, you can make easy changes, start and stop ads, etc with a click of a mouse.
I think this app is good in theory, but I'm sticking with the real adwords.
Uninstall."
"The stamped team has been an excellent partner, from set-up through troubleshooting, we've been really happy with the software, interface, team, and support."
Just got started but it looks great. Setup interface could use some work. On Edge and IE its hard to click on text entry boxes and a some boxes aligned offscreen
Sydney was helpful concerns were asked and resolved in one go! The process was smooth and swift. User-friendly interface.
"Fantastic interface and great features for targeting people leaving your site. Exit intent is a fantastic way to show a good offer, and get higher conversions. Beautiful designs too. only downside is its a little expensive"
"I love this app, it gathers reviews while you sleep! the only reason i wouldn't give five stars is i am sometimes a little confused by the interface, however in general it has helped my store and workload immensely. recommended."
"This is a great app and we love it!
But I wish they had a phone APP so we could review and manage the campaigns with a proper interface. The website does not appear on an iPhone well and not suitable for managing or building campaigns on a phone. If it was through an actual OS iPhone App it would be a better experience on the phone. 
Otherwise, a great desktop and marketing tool!"
"Stamped provides a good service for a good price. Their customer service is what's really exceptional. I wish they did video reviews for the mid-tier price, as when you're just starting out video is really important but you're not making enough revenue to justify the higher tiers. One of my biggest issues is how slow their integration is, and how sometimes things don't update unless they clear their DB cache or you have another review submitted. Overall I'm quite pleased. Frankly, less because of the interface (a bit clunky and outdated, hard to customize) and more because of the incredible customer service. Top notch, instant response and VERY clear and helpful."
Easy (enough) to use back-end interface. Allows you to create an excellent review experience for your customers. The Klaviyo integration really takes things to the next level.
"i used this app to help me with email lists and it has been great, the interface is simple, highly reccomend"
"[UPDATE REVIEW]
Setting up the ads were painless - pausing them by one click. 
Saw a bit more traffic from these ads but nothing astounding 30 or 40 visitors.
Support did not exist... or at least this email does not as 
Delivery to the following recipient failed permanently:
info@cleverecommerce.com
[code]
Technical details of permanent failure:
The error that the other server returned was:
550-5.1.1 The email account that you tried to reach does not exist. Please try
550-5.1.1 double-checking the recipient's email address for typos or
550-5.1.1 unnecessary spaces.
[/code]
This app needs better instructions on how to add/remove more products.  Contacting support every time you need to can be time consuming.  A better interface would be nice when you click on the app rather then just a dashboard.
Knowledge of ADWORDS is a must if you want to maximize the benefits of this app.  Overall I will continue to use this app as I dislike doing the words promotions myself."
The app is easy to set up and if there are issues the team is very responsive. The interface can be a little convoluted to navigate and we don't have options to set proper discount percentages unless we create a coupon from within the app. The out of the box implementation inserts certain text in areas where it's not needed and there is no edit functionality to modify. Other than that it's been helpful in testing out the viability of a subscription program.
Clean install. Easy interface. Looks great so far! Thanks.
"Easy to install and setup, actually a nice user interface for once, well designed!"
"NO results just yet but, ease of use is top ranked and I've loving the interface. Looking forward to prosperous usage."
"Really happy with that app - super easy to use, great automations and fine overall user experience!! Enjoyed the simplicity. Keep it up!!"
"Interface is a little clunky and I wish there were better analytics, but Recharge gets the job done. Their customer service is terrific and was very patient with my team. As far as subscription apps go Recharge is the best for the money."
Privy's interface is so easy to use! I love how well it integrates with my site and I am excited to see how it will increase customer interaction!
"I used this app to help gain new email subscribers, really love the easy interface. Just find it a bit pricey :)"
"Best support I ever got, free product or not! The documentation is top notch and the interface is really great!"
"Very powerful, very good service. There are corresponding operation videos in the related function interface.It's very convenient to use."
"Free functionality, easy user interface, well thought out features, responsive developers. I wish all apps were like this one!"
"Interface is very confusing for getting started, needs work to streamline the process. Setup is not as easy as others have said. Coupons created in Privy don't always reflect the same details in Shopify, so that needs work. I had to go back and forth may times to fix errors.
It's free for the most basic functionality, but every chance they get they are up-selling you to add features and get you to pay a monthly fee. They do repeatedly ask for a review which is super annoying since I haven't even created an ad yet. Gimme a few days at least to try it out.
Having said all that, once you get through the painful process of creating an add it does work as promised, so far. I'll update with more once I see how it behaves over a few weeks."
"This is my third store which is using this app, my past stores were getting large amounts of traffic just from one product ad through this app. This interface is seamless and customer support is very, very helpful and a delight to deal with."
After trialling a few review apps this was by far my fave. The interface is really clean and easy to use and the review requests look super professional. The team went above and beyond to answer all my questions and were super helpful!
I've been using the app for several months and it is a great addition to my site. I had to reach out to support recently and let me just say they are incredibly knowledgeable & responsive. They made recommendations to further improve the user experience and I can't thank them enough.
nice and easy to use interface. Lots of good options and features. Low learning curve. I love how quick and responsive the popups loads on your website
"Easy to use interface. Customer support is fast to respond and helpful, we've never gone without assistance! Highly recommended."
"This is a well-built app, works consistently without glitches. The frontend customer interface is fairly good, the back end basic reporting is easy to pull. The customer service has been prompt and friendly every time."
"So far so good... Interface is easy. Have not received significant traffic yet, but trying to tweak things still."
"Privy is a great app and very easy to use.  If I can use it without a problem, it's got to be easy!  I am looking forward to seeing its impact!  The user interface is very user-friendly."
"We integrated this into our store as we launched, and it was a great way to handle some tricky user experience / fulfillment challenges of a new store. If you are going to have pre-orders, this will save you time and energy."
Brilliant app and support. It's really like having your own merchant center team to help you with any and all problems. Intuitive interface. Really worth installing!
"Good app. I tried this first, then switched to another and then switched back. Hands down easier to use if you are not an expert like me. Support has been good so far. Intuitive and good interface"
This is exactly what I have been looking for.  Customers can fill out the review entirely in their email.  Excellent interface.
"Intuitive interface and very easy to use, highly recommend this app especially if you don't have an abandoned cart flow."
"Really user friendly interface. We've just started using it and their free features seem really cool, although if we plan on getting bigger the premium features are a must Have!"
"I was looking for the next marketing tool to recover more abandon carts and this app makes the flow so easy, for me and for my customers. It's a win-win!
It's super easy to setup, friendly user experience and tons of customizations. I love this app! Must have!"
"great app, GHUMEN is very kind to help. everything is convenient. the design and interface is easy to work."
"I am using this app. I had great instant support from the team to fix the Google policy issues. The service is more worth than the actual cost. It has fantastic features, like the all variants submission, bulk edit, quick sync, easy to use interface and better error reporting. I recommend this app for feeding your products to Google Shopping, Bing and Facebook. Multiple feed with single application."
"The app is great, user-friendly, and allows for customization to fit your store look and feel. Enabling pre-orders is a very important resource when you have fluctuating stock. Since this is our case, we wanted to tackle the issue from the beginning, and tried a few apps. Pre-Order is the best we found. By far. Which makes the fact that it is free a thing of beauty. We also integrated it with the In Stock Reminder app from the same developer, which also allows customization and is a key ability to have in ecommerce. Now, the most important aspect of the set for us has been the constant, effective, present, and attentive customer support of Philip, who took care of each and every question and request in the best way, being sincere, and offering solutions. We have an important amount of customization in our theme code, and as lovely as that is, it may sometimes create some roadblocks. For instance, we had a piece of theme customization code, and Pre-Order code overlapping and creating a less than ideal user experience. It was not easy to detect the root of the problem. The great Shopify team worked with us for a few days on it, but ultimately realized that the app developer had to help us. Philip took care of it. When the initial solution did not completely solve the matter, in less than 24 hours he delivered a new one, and all is fixed and working well now. A pleasure really. The best customer experience of all Shopify apps so far. We plan to add more of their products in the future."
"Great concept thank you! The interface is easy to use, and very easy to setup the ads!"
Was previously using another app for the same purpose until I recently saw this one. This is the app you want if you want to sell things on pre-order and capture the sale right away. Good interface and usability. Customization of the buttons and stuff is a breeze.
"great app, kevin is very kind to help. everything is convenient. the design and interface is easy to work."
Really intuitive interface for customizing your FB messenger & email marketing/abandon cart recovery. Fast & helpful support chat customer service on the site. Quality widgets that are easy to implement in your store (doesn't look spammy).
"This app saved me approx $1500.00 a month by getting abandoned carts customers to come back, easy to use interface, great marketing campaigns, everything you need for email marketing."
"Great customer service, helped me install some custom code to help with SEO for our rankings. Also, the user interface of the app + the value that the app brings as far as collecting valuable reviews is amazing."
"I've been very impressed with this app since using it the last few months, it's very intuitive and has had a positive impact on the user experience of our site. On top of this, the customer service is exceptional. Nothing is too much of a problem to ask and someone will always get back to you within a few hours, which is really appreciated."
"The best feed upload tool, with powerful functions, easy-to-operate interface, and excellent customer service"
"just started using it but very easy interface to work with, shows exactly what i need and hopefully will lead to success"
"Max and his team are really amazing. The support has always been quick, usually within minutes/hours from when I need something. Fortunately, the app really functions as promised, and for a global brand like ours, it's helpful to have the site translated into multiple languages easily. 
Great solid and stable app, easy interface, and price isn't bad either considering the added value."
Love it. Helps us seamlessly collect ratings and interface with our Shopify store is really easy. I would highly recommend.
"Excellent app !
Straightforward install and configuration, intuitive interface.
Support answers in minutes.
To us simply the best solution to run a multilingual Shopify store !"
"Very nice interface, Max from customer support is very helpful and on hand, all the time :) will try some manual translations soon but for now the automatic one's work just fine! Tried a few different apps for translations this one is the best and best bang for your buck as well as excellent support!"
"I just started to use Weglot, i can say that the interface is intuitive and and the support team is also very professional, quick replies to my e-mails. Thank you!"
really good customer service! would definitely recommend it. Good and easy interface. Had no issues with adding the app to my theme
Really great and fast support. Emailed support for help and they fixed within a couple hours. Nice email interface for customers to use. Works great and we love seeing the reviews flow in from customers :)
Awesome and easy to use app. Works great and the interface is simple to follow.
"As an affiliate marketer, we've used Feed for Google Shopping to syndicate our product feed to various partners. It's worked seamlessly for this, with an easy to use interface. When we've had certain requests from partners, the support team has been on hand to help. Various members of our team use this for Google Shopping and Paid Social and also recommend the app."
Just awful app. Reviews aren't up to date. Bad interface. Lags everywhere. You have to set up all codes by yourself.. So bad.
"Awesome app, saw results about a week after. Very easy to use interface and easy to make adjustments."
"Stamped.io is hands down the best review app for the money. It has the identical features to enterprise solutions like Yotpo and Power Reviews at nearly ONE TENTH the cost. You'll get reviews with photos and video, social media integration, customer Q&A, NPS, and dozens more features all in an easy to use interface that integrates will all major shopping carts. The support staff is incredible, they answer emails around the clock and typically resolve issues in less than a few hours. If you are looking for a feature rich, scalable and affordable UGC solution, look no further than Stamped.io."
So far so good -- easy to use interface. Already have several impressions in only a matter of minutes! Excited to see more!
Easy to use interface and it got me traffic almost immediately.
"Hands down, this is the best feeds app that works with Shopify.. everything is very well explained in neat videos, the use of the interface in very easy and detailed, and not to mention the support team, they're extremely experienced and helpful. Today I had an issue with my Google feed and they actually connected to my Google Merchant Center and had a chat with Google support to check and explain the issue and get an idea on what's the reason behind my problem. I would give a 10 out of 5 stars for this exceptional support :)
Keep up the great and high standard support Simprosys team.. thumbs up!"
This is probably one of my favorite APPS -- Use it on all my stores and love the constant new features and easy to use interface.  Saves me (and makes me) a lot of money.
"absolutely amazing app
super easy to use, stylish, clean interface and though I have only just installed it, just the way my first campaign looks  is enough to justify a 5star rating
an absolute must have"
"It is ridiculous to require people to submit a review before they have had a chance to use the app for a while. The interface will take some getting used to and exploring before I can give a reliable review. From what I have seen so far, the app seems fairly easy to use to create pop-ups. Now, we wait to see how it functions once my Shopify store is live."
"Awesome so far, just starting to use program but seems like tons of useful tools! Simplistic interface makes for easy editing of campaigns and setting up split testing."
I love the simple to use interface. Quick and easy to set up. Takes the difficulty out of retargeting clients.
Simple Interface. Easy Integration. More features. Smooth performance. More Customization. Responsive design.
"This is a great all-around store-to-ad-platform product data feed. So far I've interfaced it from Shopify to Google Merchant Center (GMC) and from Shopify to Microsoft Merchant Center (MSMC). AFAIK, one can't (yet) do that directly from Shopify without an intermediary such as the SimproSys feed. I do have one suggestion for improvement: Some products qualify for MSMC but not for GMC because of differences in the de facto image compliance rules between these two platforms, for which MSMC may issue waivers but not GMC. Some vendors require their logo to be displayed on the main product image but GMC doesn't allow this. The current SimproSys solution is to submit (sync) all of your products from your Google Shopping collection in Shopify to both platforms, then quickly go through the process of excluding certain products from GMC within the SimproSys app. A much cleaner, set-and-forget solution from the user's point of view would be to allow the user to define a GMC-specific Shopify collection and an MSMC-specific Shopify collection. Then all of the products in each collection get periodically synced to their respective advertising platforms without extra urgent user effort that one could easily forget to do. Hope this helps!"
"Great app. It does exactly what it should do and more. I very quickly learned I had not setup google shopping properly and therefore it was not working. The moment I opened the app I could see this. Very simple interface with very powerful capabilities. Within just a couple of days, I now have 10,000 products on google shopping, bing shopping and facebook! Very happy. Thanks Team!"
"I've just started using Privy, from the interface and the options I get in designing my forms, Its a sure winner!"
"I was rather puzzled by the fact that the application automatically translate the site. Of course Weglot bives you the possibility to manually review the automatic translations and thus the problem does not exist.
I chose it because compared to other applications that I tested Weglot was capable of fully translating the site, not only checkout and notifications (I highly customized the theme and other applications couldn't translate all the content like Weglot). The only limitation of this app is that it can not translate the content generated dynamically after the page has loaded (but the Support team told me that they are working on it).
In addition to the its power, it's amazing his intuitiveness of use: you can use its visual editor that lets you select the site content to be translated and the translation is performed by the website interface. A total new way to translate than the classic stream by which you send the text to the translator and then the translator sends you the translations and you have to load them: you do everything in a single step.
Finally, a big thank you for the support and precisely to James. We've really flooded the support with many, many emails and James has always responded quickly, with great skill and ... patience. James helped us to fix all the issues that inevitably arises when you build an ecommerce from scratch."
"Great support, genuine app interface and easy to use & navigate through the features. The best reviews app available on Shopify right now."
Recart has a very simple to use interface and I got my first sale within a few days of using...so I know it works. Got 66 subscribers in a weeks time which is amazing.  Thanks very much team!
So far so good! Loving the easy interface but has yet to try out the abandoned cart part.
"Does everything you need it to. Great interface. Installation was straight forward, with just one simple tweak needed in my settings which customer service was prompt to help with. Highly recommend!"
"Great app, nice user interface and very easy to pick up use. Tracking lost carts is such an important thing."
"Good interface, easy to use, get data from products.
recomend it"
Great easy to use app!!  Very nice interface and very easy to set up and use!
Great concept and execution. The simple to use interface makes integration really easy!
This seemed easy to use and install but I can't work out if it has automatically synced with Mailchimp or not and the interface doesn't seem as intuitive. I've not found the templates as easy to use as Mailchimp and the help desk not as accessible as I'd hoped. I'm sure it will be good but I need support to get set up that doesn't seem that easy to access
"Awesome plugin, easy to install. Improved user experience, recommended installation. Thanks for this plugin"
this app is easy to use and i love the mass edit interface and easy mass save only thing i would like is to be able to add my own product type. but other than that i love how you can hand pick the products you want to advertise.
"Just migrated from Yotpo and wish I'd found Stamped sooner ... has all the features I was dying for, much more customizability, WAY better support, cleaner interface, more control, etc. etc."
"Amazing customer service and a very powerful app. Not the best interface though, which makes their amazing customer service very clutch."
Recart is a MUST have if you want completed purchases for cart abandoners! You can customize the user experience and bump up some more sales!
"good app that is free for the first 1000 emails. has great features, super customizable and easy user interface."
Gnarly service! I have high hops. Interface user-friendly and simple.
"Looks professional, nice interface and features are perfect. So far so good."
"Amazing review system! Clean interface, absolutely loved it. Please include ali express review importer on the free plan!!!
EDIT: it does! install this app especially if your store is new."
"20% CR on the first week of use!
Great app with exceptional user experience."
Very simple and easy to use interface. So far if did not help me with extra traffic.
"Awesome product: easy to implement, efficient interface between SF and the different selling markets FB, IG, Google for your catalogs , great reactive support!"
"User Interface is clunky, not very intuitive. I'm using the Free version, so hope that these issues wouldn't be as pronounced if I were to pay for a subscription. Editing forms crashes a lot, causing me to have to save every time I do a simple change. Useful and I guess worth every penny I've paid so far, although I've signed up for the $10 automation feature, and still don't have a clue how to use it or if it's really what I need. I don't find the support to be very informative either. I do get some signups, but few and far between. Could be because I can't get the forms to display correctly, or because I can't figure out how to make the interface less painful and frustrating. I would recommend you try out other, more sophisticated apps if you can't get the hang of this very quickly..."
"I am only just starting out, but already Recart is a Game Changer for me, I am so excited about whats to come, the interface is so easy to use with Templates Set Up immediately ready for use, Fantastic App :D"
Super Easy and Clean Interface!
"great app, super easy to use. I seen that other stores were using this and loved the interface so we got it"
"Waiting to see any progress,5 stars for easy user interface"
Love this app. Immediately began generating great reviews day one after installing. The interface is super user friendly and the the support responds really quickly. They answered all my questions and helped me with some issues I had with my set-up.  I wish other apps I have been using worked so well. I highly recommend the Stamped.io team and app.
"Great app. Love to use it! 
The interface is pretty easy to use."
"Great app. Love to use it! 
Interface is pretty easy to use."
Interface is quite easy to use. Setting up campaigns is also simple.
"Great team, customer support and intuitive interface!  Really happy so far and the onboarding was extremely easy.  
5-Stars and highly recommend giving them a try!"
Everything is great!! very easy and friendly interface
"Ok, firstly before reading the review - don't just blindly install this or any other app for Google feed or Google Channel without first looking up things like ""suspension of Google Merchant Account"" on YT and see how a person (like myself) might excitedly install such and the next moment find themselves with a suspended account! Totally gut-wrenching for anyone trying to simply get started with advertising on Google Shopping... Now, that said, if you take things slowly at first, you might actually get accepted my Google, and the EASIEST way to sort out your Google Fields in bulk on your products is by using THIS APP. The Shopify native Google Channel is far too clunky to use and doesn't easily filter everything. This GSF app is the ""bees knees""! So far the service staff have been wonderful for me, and I've had prompt, knowledgeable assistance via email and their chat interface. Yep, they rock! (Whereas there is a ""free app"" out there whose service people, within minutes of me chatting to them, wanted admin access to my Google Merchant Account... yeah right.... like, what the...!?).
Yeah nah, like I said, these guys rock - the GSF dudes are ""ridgey-didge""! (Look it up if you don't know..)
I think the feed syncing feature of the app is sweet, though the channel submission selection needed an instructional video to find.. that could be stuck somewhere on a product line for easier access (but I suppose it's just something to get used to, since the bulk editing on this app kicks arse! (and yeah, that's the way I spell it..)) ;)"
Great ads easy interface love the app as a whole!!
"We love Aftership! It's easy to use and setup and we've been in business for awhile now, using a number of apps... but this one is the best. Afterships interface is easy to navigate through and helps us with our customer issues. Great app highly recommended!"
good instruments and interface
"Thank god for stamped.io!
This product is soo much easier and smoother than any similar product I've used. It has everything you need in terms of UGC for your site, within such a simple interface. Many options are free, and the ones you pay for - you got your money's worth!
I love this product!"
"It was too good to be true alas it is real, there customer service is top noche anyone like me that is will to do work to get more free organic traffic seriously get this App and I can tell you though it's in the early stage but definitely get the work done, hassle free, easy interface and yes improvement coming up. IT'S FREE to use as you see fit. Thank You sixads

AfterShip allows us to seamlessly integrate our return & exchange program into our site with a user friendly interface that guides our customers every step of the way.
Stamped.io is an affordable solution compared to other big-name review software apps.  We have used 2 other review services and stamped.io is the best.   We have enjoyed the customer service. They have been responsive and solved all of our needs.   We enjoy the customer interface of the app.
Awesome app with easy interface and rich in features.
"I love this app, and the customer service is phenomenal. The interface is easy to use and customize to display our store's growing number of reviews for our amazing Canine Cloud pet bed/lounger. When I e-mailed the developer with a question the night before a holiday, he fixed the issue for me right away (I thought he was just going to tell me how to do it). I encourage you to install this app for all of your store's review needs."
"Great app! inerface is great! although I do think that a ""best review"" ""worst review"" feature makes a better user experience"
"Saved me tons of time for just $5/month. So much easier to use than the shopify interface for making changes to google feeds, and it makes my facebook shop nicer as well."
Haven't had a return yet. But the app interface looks neat and organized for someone to make a return conveniently. Setup was simple. I highly recommend this app to organize returns.
Easy to use design User Interface
Very helpful staff. I especially liked how easy it is to customize the review e-mails. User interface is easy to navigate too.
"I wanted to provide all the facilities to my customers and Returns is an issue whose solution is nowhere on Shopify. But then came Aftership Returns acting as life-saver. Really it has made everything so easy. I have a separate Returns Page where customers can easily request for return, and all this in no extra cost. Thank You so much for this amazing App. If you want to give your customers a high-level user experience then Aftership Returns and Tracking Order Apps are a must on your Shopify Store."
"Aftership makes it super easy to give my customers 100%
Their seamless design and simple interface allow me to plug and play a return page into my website, without all of the hassle of writing the code!
I don't know what I would do without it!
TheNerdArmory"
"Seems like a user friendly interface, and as much as it looks a bit complicated at first, with the guides little help you realize that's it's actually pretty simple to use and navigate!"
"Was using mailchimps signup form for my ecommerce store. It was okay, but this is on another level. The customization capabilities and ease of use on privy's interface is amazing. Looking forward to growing my business with privy, will be upgrading soon!"
"I had a slight technical issue (I made a mistake when I installed it) so I contacted support. They responded within minutes, logged in to my site with a support account and fixed all the issues within minutes. Couldn't be happier! The app itself looks great, the user interface is easy to use, and I was able to import reviews from one of my other stores with ease. Highly recommend!"
Extremely user friendly interface that guides you right through!
"Our shop uses Aftership Returns and we couldnt be more happier. Easy to use, beautiful interface... everything you dream when it comes to This kind of apps.
Highly recommended by FUZA SHOES."
"Easy installation. Nice interface. Hope I won't need it, but eventually someone will want to return."
very good customer service! highly recommend and the interface of the app is very easy to navigate and understand
So far so good! It can be confusing between this in another product they have sharing the same interface.
"if you know at least minimum of digital markting, you will see the power of this app, it includes also REMARKTING tags! with add carts, etc! amazing! dont need do it via anlytics, and dynamic remarkting code, EXCELENT APP, the only thing you guys could improve is rules to apply google categorys. and maybe interface, but the rest, 100% and its only 1st day testing this. I found that can filter by name, and aply bulk edits. PERFECT!"
"Very helpful team and vital app to grow your business! Went from Yotpo business to Stamped (business account), much better interface and pricing feels right compared to other apps! Thanks."
Great app with intuitive interface and powerful features. I moved all my feeds here and have been extremely happy with the results and the support provided. Highly recommended!
This app helped me to easy get reviews trough the easy to use interface! That also includes questions! very helpfull!!!!!!!
Love this app! Great interface and easy to use. Customer service is great too! The stamped-io team is really responsive and helpful. Thank you! :)
Easy interface but limited space for custom design. but it does what it does.
Superb..... Easy to manage form field & User interface is also good..... Support team is too quick :)
"Martin is the man! Also, Tom throughout the last 2 years using Stamped.io. I almost considered switching over to Loox, but the support team and Stamped.io Interface is beyond amazing. Thanks again for everything!"
"Excellent review app, I prefer it much better over the competition due to easier to use interface and faster loading times. Support is very responsive."
"very good user experience. Fast support. detailed documention helps a lot. With this app, you can just import or add as many reviews as you want. Questions&Answers is good too!"
"Great help by support staff and a really easy to use interface. So glad I chose to work with Stamped.io for my customer reviews. I recently had an issue and they helped really quickly too,"
I'm very happy with the services of Returns Center and the easy to use/user-friendly interface. They have been nothing but supportive from the day the that I first install and would happily recommend it to anyone who like things organized and neat.
"I switched from Yotpo to Stamped and love Stamped!! It's enabled me to send more requests for review, thereby generating more reviews and social proof for my website. The interface is really easy to use, and customising emails is simple."
"Since installing this app my reviews have increased by 300%. It's a really simple user interface, the support is fantastic and the value for money is excellent."
"Not had a return yet but from what I see the concept is good and the interface looks nice and was easy to set up.
On www.9figures.co.uk"
Love it!  Easy to use and great interface.  Great Customisation!
"This app is wonderful. First of all, you get a really amazing support as you transition to their app. They respond really quickly to my questions/emails. They installed the app on our site and they even took out the old widget. Even before signing on as an enterprise user, they offered to migrate our old reviews to the new one. Love the interface and how you can customize everything. They have really amazing tools and features. Just loving everything about this review app. It's so easy and even if you can't do it yourself, you have a team that you can count on to help you solve any problems. I definitely recommend this app, whether you're a small business or a big company.
Update 8/14/2019 - Still loving the app and customer service. The Instagram Feature is so easy to use and install to my site. Stamped.io truly has one of the best customer support out there. Thanks!!! <3
Update 2/12/2020 - The Stamped.io team is really wonderful to work with. They are quick to reply to customer support issues and they are great at problem solving. Love, love, love!"
Awesome App! Saves your potential customers and converts them to buyers! Easy and very customizable interface.
"Fantastic Customer Support!  We had an issue with Google Merchant Center and the team from Simprosys started working on it right away (at 3am).  The app interface is clean and intuitive.  I highly recommend this app because it's easy to use, has great support, and a reasonable price."
"Nothing but good things to say. Pricing is fair, customizability is good, and the dashboard/ user interface is excellent after the update. Very intuitive & easy to use, plus customer service is great. After trying many different review platforms, we have no reason to leave Stamped.io. Stamped provides everything we need and more."
"Wow, received incredible service today. Had some troll review on our website that caused quite a bit of drama but Tommy managed to respond and fix it all within an hour. Really took the stress away from a small business owner like myself. Highly recommend Stamped.IO for their simple to use interface, and most importantly customer service!"
"I encountered a problem during the installation, and Thimatic quickly solved the problem for me. The interface is very good, it is very suitable for me."
"great user interface, amazing features can't wait to see it in action with bigger numbers on my site"
Superb.....! The features is exceptionally user friendly. The interface is awesome. Hope I will lead more sales through this app.
"Very intuitive interface.  Setup was very easy as it doesn't require any difficult configuration. Best of all, the app is free, robust, and no coding is necessary. Highly recommend this app. It makes returning products a breeze for both the customers and your business."
The app helps me to interface with the shopping platforms in an easy way. And the support is very good.
"Returns Center is one of the best features our store has. Every single visitor commends us on having an efficient way to process returns and give shoppers complete control of this process. The setup process is very painless, the interface is intuitive and a developer has been very responsive to an inquiry. Great experience so far!"
"OMG! I have been searching for an app just like Recart! Great interface, great features and user friendly for beginners to shopify just like me. Highly recommended!!"
We have been so impressed with this app. The knowledge centre and guides are 1st class. The developers are beyond helpful and so knowledgeable. The app interface itself is really good to use. Excellent!
"Love this, nice app.  Clean looking interface too."
We love that you are able to create multiple campaigns with various discount codes and switch between them at the touch of a button. Intuitive interface and super easy Mailchimp integration. It has offered us various insights on our heating products store The Noble Flame. Try it and see for yourself!
I can not thank the support team at Aftership enough for working through all the questions and the special request that I have had for both the new returns app. The Aftership returns app offers a clean user interface for my customer to process returns request. I can't wait till they get the added features up and running for further customization. Keep up the great work Aftership.
So glad I found this app. The user interface is simple and easy to navigate. I appreciate the fact that I can customize my emails to meet the needs of my shop. It's also easy for the customer to leave a review and isn't some long complicated process as other review platforms. Will definitely be keeping!
Super quick customer support. Detailed documentation and intuitive interface. Supports multiple Geos which is what I was looking for.
"Recart is awesome! Very intuitive interface & easy to understand, while having almost every feature you could want for an app like this."
"After jumping to an appropriate plan, I noticed an immediate increase in the number of reviews we were receiving.

In doing so we got first-hand feedback on our products, could give customers a better PPE and also address any concerns or issue customers had to turn detractors into brand advocates.
I would like a bit of a better interface to manage the pending list, or a way to display reviews for products no longer on our store (we remove sold out products we won't repurchase). That last bit might be on shopify but it could be cool to have a ""hall of fame"" of reviews.
Thanks"
amazing app:) easy to install with a very friendly interface the only missing thing is when you are in the collection you can not see the review stars! You will need to enter the product page to see that
"Pretty easy to use interface. I like the customization options and I think they give you plenty to work with in the free plan. It seamlessly connects to my shopify and since my shopify is connected to my mailchimp, my mailchimp is automatically updated (perfect for when I want to send out information or announcements to my list)."
Their support team is beyond helpful and are always willing to answer questions or help you through their interface! 100% recommend
"I have to say this is the best app review on Shopify store, not only it's free but also because of they have the best support team. About this app it's easy-to-access, multi-functional interface. There is nothing to criticize because they have done really well"
"Great app.
It has a lot of layouts to use and not just the regular list layout.
the interface is easy and friendly to use!"
Great app. Great features. Awesome user interface. Get more sales with recart.
"The support is top-notch and the app works smoothly. Easy to use and managing interface is far better than other similar apps. 2021 Updates:
Contacted the support for some questions and they responded instantly with great help!"
"The interface is lacking and left me confused on a few occasions. However, the customer support is top notch and with their help I am happy with the product. However, I wish it was easier to further customize the branding of emails."
"Best review app we have found. Our customers are interacting with the interface, increasing reviews and subsequently our SEO. We have a pretty busy site and requested some customization to be done to the app and the developer was very helpful, responsive and affordable."
first review I've written. Well deserved. We were on a competitor's review app and saw SO many GREAT reviews for stamped.io on a FB group. We decided to switch. The team made everything seamless and now we are paying 1/10th of the price for better content. We're getting so much more reviews with stamped.io vs the competitor's. What made us switch was I could not for the life of me figure out how to use the other interface. Stamped is user friendly so I am SO glad we made the switch!
"I really like the design of the review interface. and their support team is super on point and very helpful. And the fact that it has a free plan, really help me as I am just starting to grow my store."
Best app for recovering sales! Works straight out the box and brilliant interface
"I have started using this app about a month ago and I love it.
It makes the connection smooth and trouble-free. 
It integrates Google, Bing, and Facebook under one easy to use interface.
Support is fast and knowledgeable. When I was staring they REALLY helped me to get comfortable with the app and its functions. 
I highly recommend this app!!"
Fast customer service and easy to use interface. Recommend this app for anyone who wants to up their review game. :)
Very easy user interface and exactly what I was looking for.
"We have just finished the setup process for Stamped.IO and while we initially had difficulty configuring the app on our own, we were delighted at the support teams timely responsiveness and help in making the app what we needed it to be.  We have only set up the basic features so far, but are looking forward to seeing how the review collection process goes and hope to configure some of the additional bells and whistles like check-out comments in the future.  Again, the support team has been awesome, but sometimes we felt like a nuisance (not because of them) with all of the questions and support tickets we send and would ideally like to be more self-sufficient with the onboarding process. We hope they'll continue to build their self-help and app user interface for more ease as they grow. Thanks for your help StampedIO and now that we're set up, let the reviews roll in :-)"
Been using them for a while now. No complaints on the user interface or customer service side. Pretty happy with both.
"I recommend this app, good features and great support team behind it. The interface is great and brings value to my business"
"We use it to collect reviews, and it does that very well. It also integrates with our loyalty program, and the interface is great. The support is also fantastic. They helped me consolidate my reviews from the old and new product pages, and installed the updated widget for me. Thanks!"
"Stamped.io is one of the best review platforms I have ever used on Shopify. The interface is very simple to understand and customize, which is amazing. If you can’t figure something out, the Stamped team is SUPER friendly and is amazing at answering our inquiries. 
This is a very user-friendly platform on the consumer side as well. The e-mails are very straight forward and easy to follow up on. 
Try them out, I don’t think you will be disappointed! 
Edit: Also, the Founder is the best guy and is the biggest help ever!"
"A very good app. Still testing out different functions, but I must praise its user friendly interface. I believe it just takes some gentle learning for us."
"This is a fantastic app for the price and has an amazing feature set! Easy to use, simple interface & great support! looking forward to hooking up to our new rewards program!"
Just installed and look forward to seeing it in action. Creating professional campaigns is easy with their user friendly interface.
"Great app for submitting products to Google Shopping. Automatically updates listings. User friendly interface.
Excellent customer service for support, super quick response, very helpful. Highly recommended."
Really easy to set up and a nice interface. I have used other Shopping feed apps before and felt that it was easier to get started with this one. It even has a button to add conversion tracking ( tried to do this manually before and it was a HUGE headache to figure out by myself). Then I ran into a feature that I thought it didn't have... but luckily I reached out to support and they replied right away with a solution.
"Great app, have been using it for over 6 months. Makes it easy to set up your Google Shopping account, far easier than dealing with Googles crappy interface. Well worth the money!"
Their support is absolutely awesome!  Definitely the best part while working through little tweaks we wanted in our on-site interface.  We've been accomodated every step of the way!
"Used app to integrate and launch google shopping, much easier to use than Google's own interface and linked seamlessly with Shopify. Any issues I did have were resolved quickly by a very helpful customer services team. Would highly recommend."
"very nice easy to use, clean interface"
"A great Google Shopping Feed interface that's easy to navigate.  And support is incredibly responsive.  Thank you, thank you Milan for your help troubleshooting + extra tips.  Very much appreciated."
Clean and clear. Like the interface and they have all the functions I would expect from a good popup software. I evaluated others and this one was the best for our needs
"After a couple days using it, I feel that is the best decision ever. Configuration is very friendly, Save tons of wotk using your pre-definite templates. Interface is very easy, also have a integration woth another apps that makes more completely this app. the percentaje of email open really increase, also the percentaje of recovery carts is visibly good"
Solid interface and super easy to Use! Would recommend for any person looking to recoup Sales!
"Great app, thank you. Installation and customisation are very easy. We love the interface as well. 
100% recommended."
"This app works better than other apps I tried, plus I like the interface very much. The support goes above and beyond to help, and I like that more than anything."
"I'm was inspired to use Recart by good recommendation in Facebook group. The interface is clean & it's easy to setup. Recart have superior marketing channel in various angle such as email, push notification, messenger and many more. Feel good about the app."
"It took a few tries to get used to the interface, it's not super easy to use for beginner, after some practice, now I know how to create a new popup quickly! Thanks! Check out my site Livey Lovey for popup examples https://liveylovey.com  :D"
So far so great! Loved the interface and ease of use. Let's see how great the conversions are :)
"Good app that really helps with abandoned carts. Many useful functions and features as well. However, the interface could be improve such as the time settings, because certain timing were unable to be selected but no notifications were given."
"Easy to use app, nice interface. Great support by the team. I am really looking forward to use the app to its fullest potential."
Great! It's an all encompassing notifications app with an easy user interface.
"I haven't fully completed my first newsletter as my site is still in development, but Privy's easy-to-use drag and drop interface is making creating my first newsletter very easy and interactive."
"super easy interface
great app already increrased c onversions"
"This app is amazing and a total game changer for your shopify store, and the user interface to edit everything is super easy to use"
"This is a must app for all e-commerce owners to own. Its user-friendly interface will sure to increase the conversion of a store's abandoned carts. Thank you, Recart!"
"Yotpo was way overpriced so I went with Stamped instead. It does the job and the founder Tommy seems like a really hard working guy and gives GREAT support.
He seems to always be upgrading and improving his product which is great.
Most importantly, everything I've used works, and it's a very complete software. 
Some constructive criticism would be to improve the user interface, but this is probably easier said than done. They've recently improved the UI for the review request options koodos for them on that.
All their app improvements are logged and easily seen in the ""updates"" tab which is really convenient for me to see what new features I can experiment with.
Keep up the good work Tommy."
Works ok but it could use a better user interface.
I the easy integration and user friendly interface.
Great app and very user friendly interface!
A solution that works from the start. Automation that is crucial to improving your CRO right away. The interface is easy and functional and works out of the box. Excellent work Recart! Connect with Wheelio to experience some poetry :)
"Easy to use! The interface is intuitive, and works great with the Motion Theme"
Interface is pretty straight forward and it gets the job done! 5/5 great app
Very Good...Easy to use...beautiful interface!!!
"easy to use. nice interface. cant wait to see my lists grow,"
"Great app. Very easy to use, and the CS was very fast in answering any questions. My products are all approved, and I like the fact that the app has an interface where you can edit details like product titles, etc. right within the app."
"The interface is user-friendly. I love the support. The fact that they go and test out for you, just to check if something is working or not is amazing. Looking forward to launching my store and see how it'll boost conversions :). I highly recommend."
"We were almost ready to jump and sign up with another company (that charges an outrageous amount of money) and then we found Stamped.io!! We thought, there has to be something wrong as they were charging such an affordable amount to achieve the same results.   After reading the reviews, we contacted them to ask a few questions and to our surprise, received an email right back with all the answers!  We ended up signing up with them that day and had all our previous reviews imported to our site that same day! The online interface where you create your emails is easy to navigate and any question we had, they answered back in no time! We already have our star reviews showing up in Google and it's been 2 weeks!  We couldn't be happier with them!  They run a company the way it's supposed to be run!  If you're still on the fence, just jump like we did!"
"This app is great so far.  I love the interface.  I got an error in Google that I didn't know how to fix and Amit fixed it in minutes.  10 stars for support, I'm excited to see it work as time goes on.  Thank you Amit!!"
"This app is ESSENTIAL for every Shopify seller. It has an incredibly easy interface which constantly updates and shows you errors on your store which you can fix in bulk. There are many options to edit your product data directly on the app and feed it to the google merchant center. 
The best part of the app is its customer service. Amit is extremely approachable, friendly and prompt Google Expert who has maintained a very good relationship with our team since the beginning. He has helped understand the reasons for using his app, the benefits and course of action in a very simplified manner. 
If you want to start Google Adwords then this app is a MUST HAVE. I use only those apps in my store which make sense. And this app, along with its brilliant customer service, makes sense. 
Thanks, Amit for your help!"
"I don't write reviews often and this one is well deserved.
Amit was able to help solve our feeds problems quickly! I would recommend this app to anyone looking to set up Google Shopping ads. They have great support and an easy to use interface. 
Cheers!"
Just started using but good interface.
"The app is THE best for providing an app that syncs from Shopify into Google Merchant Centre (GMC). Amit and has team have definitely created a super-easy way to achieve the end goal.  The app also has a great user interface (UI) and provides extra conditions of controlling which products you need within GMC.
Great work guys!!"
"Easy to use interface with beautiful, reliable popus.  Very satisfied. I have been using this product for some time now and am completely satisfied."
It has a really ugly interface but this app so easy to use and takes the headache out of setting up the shopping feed. It is also a great price.
first try :) looks good. Easy interface
"Very good, nice interface, so powerful!!"
don´t really like its. complicated interface and can just submit 5 products for free
very easy to use interface! Good for me to understand and capture as many leads as possible!
"Easy to use, user friendly interface"
"The Stamped.io app is simply amazing and easy to use! Customer service is absolutely top notch and I can't say enough about how helpful the Stamped.io  team was getting us up and running (Even on the weekend). We came over from another very popular review app that is very nice but has just skyrocketed in pricing over the years. Stamped.io has every feature you need and more. The platform provides an easy to use interface for us and for our customers. You just can't go wrong with this app.
I highly recommend everyone who has a Shopify store to get this app.
Update: I usually dont follow up with updates on an app but we have been using this app for a couple of years now and the Stamped.io customer service continues to be just top notch amazing! We just have not received the type of great responses to questions and features from other apps like we have from Stamped .io. They are simply the best!"
I really like this app. The design interface makes it easy to create great content. Love it so far
"Easy interface, quick set-up - could literally not be any easier. Will see what conversion rates are, but so far so good!"
Great customer support and easy to use interface
Recart is pretty awesome! It has so many useful features to increase conversions. The interface is very clean and easy to use!
"Loving the interface, easy to use with lots of great tips."
"Recently installed this app and love it! Easy to use interface and tons of features, billing is very fair. Great app overall!"
So far easy interface. I'll review further after using for a little while and see some results
You must use this! I really like the interface and the quality that it brings
"Awesome, Easy interface, super useful"
Really Nice and Easy to use. Good Interface. =]
Very easy to use! The interface is elegant and clear. Very happy with this service.
"User friendly interface, most features are great."
Une interface très claire intuitive et le support réagit très activement.
customer ratings are critical for ecomm purchases. This app is amazing in letting me customize the user experience! .... they are also super responsive when I have questions - fabulous customer experience! highly recommended!
"Great support.  So much easier then Yotpo.  No more editing code for 2 days every time we want to update our theme.  Easy, simple to use interface with lots of customization.  Best of all, it's responsive for mobile.  Highly recommended.

UPDATED Review
-------------------------
Feeling Optimistic! Just wanted to update our review here. Originally left stamped a 5 star glowing review. I would like to say after 2 years working with stamped, they provide an outstanding, professional service, second to none. The customer service is seriously fast, professional and reliable, even working weekends. I have a lot of experience dealing with developers and App staff, these guys know their stuff so well they mostly don't even require access to your theme, CSS or HTML, they seem to just know what to do, which means they have massive experience with all shopify themes! I'm updating this review because they have helped my business grow 10 fold, the app they have created is really wonderful and easy to use and very reliable, I love the blog notifications/update centre they have within admin , it's great to keep updated on new features and integration with other App's... I Don't want to over do this review, but if you're looking for a reviews app, or have one and are being charged a fortune for it ... I highly recommend stamped. Big Shout out to Tommy! Thanks for your help dude! Best, EuropaBay Limited.

Original Review
---------------------
A must have Reliable App and a must have customer experience from shopry for all shopify shops & Users! First Class all the way. Interface is clean, crispy and easy to use, Plenty of Highly Sought After features available for FREE! There are a few review apps out there and I have tested them and Shopry is a Lot More than just a review app, its a way to engage and involve your customers with your business, You can even reward them with a coupon for the review via email. The email sent out to customers is again clean and crispy looking and easy to navigate with loads of features like remaining anonymous when leaving reviews - Glad I finally have a reviews program that is perfect for my store. Many Thanks to Tommy who helped me out with some extra cool features :)"

"So far during the free trial recart has worked great!
It's easy to understand and the interface is nice looking and straight forward unlike some other apps i have used that are just plain and take time to figure out
I will most likely upgrade to paid sub once i am finished with my trial period!"

"I just got started and I really like it so far. The instructional tour wasn't too long and it was actually helpful. The interface is easy to use, but I haven't explored all of it. About 2 minutes into setting up my first pop up, ironically they popped up with an offer to leave a review. I actually do like this app. I never leave reviews and it made me click through ... so I want to see how well it will work with my customers."

"very easy to design, nice user experience."

"It's a very tidy app, highly customisable while retaining a very simple and easy User Experience. Best pop up app on Shopify."

"GREAT APP!!! 0 complaints, and a clean interface.."
Excellent Interface. Very easy to use. Definitely Recommend!

Wow! Super user friendly :)  Great interface.
"Excellent training on the system, great support and a simple user interface. Fantastic app."
I've heard really good things about Privy and the user interface so far is superb!

"Interface is hard to learn, but the tools are good. I'll continue using it."
very good like the interface very well done
Very easy to design pop up. Clean interface and very useful!
East interface to use. Great app and friendly.
Really nice and easy to use. One of the best interfaces I've ever seen
Super easy to setup. The developer took the time to design an intuitive user interface and has taken a lot of guesswork out setting up for the first time.
really great app! interface is easy to use and design is beautiful. could maybe customise more by adding more fonts but minor issue! thanks!
"works great, nice interface, no complaints"
easy to configure and the interface is pretty clean and smooth
Super user friendly interface!
Easy to use interface and lots of help from customer service representatives
"So, so great! Thanks for making user interface so friendly."
Very easy to use and user-friendly interface !
Awesome value with an intuitive interface. Not often something so good comes along that is that easy to use.
The interface and app is great
Interface of the tool is good. But my function to capture email is not responding as per the settings i.e. not popping up when intending to leave the site.
Easy-to-use interface for starting out
Really Dope! Really flexible and the interface is intuitive :)
Wow. Brilliant concept. Amazing interface. Easy to set up. 5 stars. www.raizl.com
Great user friendly interface. Enough features in freemium to add
Works great! The interface was very easy to use. The instructions were simple enough to follow.
Your navigation back to the items I managed to create was difficult to navigate. The interface with items I'm making and how they correspond was also a little difficult to figure out. Just kept clicking and eventually it worked.
Great app.  Easy to use interface.
User interface is really easy to navigate.
Just Awesome !!! User interface is so much cool. Here now started to use i think feel better and get much more experience.
"so far so good, pretty easy to use decent user interface."
Great App. Easy to use.   T'he interface is straightforward and feel it can add more optins.
Very easy to use! Great interface!
"Interface is nice and easy to use, haven't launched our first campaign yet."
"I was torn between a 3 and 4 star review because the app itself is very easy to use and works well.
My complaints are control around customizing the user experience. On mobile, I have painfully watched recordings of customers trying in vain to click the little x to close the window. Sometimes I think they get so frustrated that they leave. There should be an option to allow click-out close on mobile. Like they should be able to click outside of the window for it to close. 
Also a custom size on mobile would be great - like just a banner instead of a whole popup. I know there are work-arounds, but they're not ideal.
Overall, I would still recommend this app. It is free, after all, and collects emails quite well. I just think there is a bit of room for improvement."
"Great little app, simple to use and seems to be working really well. Interface is easy to use also"
"This app was not only super easy to install, the user interface is a breeze.
They literally walk you step-by-step through all of the elements you can customize before launching your pop-up.
Definitely the easiest pop-up software I've ever used."
"Works as advertised, nice interface. Nuff said?"
Great user experience and tool!
"Super easy to use, the videos and interface make Privy dummy proof. I can't wait to see the results!"
"Nice interface, just using the free level for now, but impressed."
"So far, so good!  Easy interface and lots of options."
"Good Job, user friendly interface"
"I give 5 stars - easy to set up and a the support was quick and good when I wasn't sure about a pop up form issue. 
If you are testing the function ""on exit"" (a sign up form should pop up when a person is about to leave your website), please open another browser or refresh your current one because the code works only once for a user experience - to stop annoying users that either signed up already or ignored the message!! That's truly amazing..."
So far so good. The interface is very intuitive. Haven't actually started collecting emails though.
"great app, glad that it ingergrates with various programs and apps. Good interface and design too"
easy to use interface and great option for implementing this type of data capture
"Easy interface for a newby! Great design options, even with the free version."
very user friendly interface.. easy to use. great support!
I like the interface alot. its easy to use and navigate. i will continue to use this app
"Easy user interface and good features, even in the free version."
works great simple interface and easy to use.
"The interface is intuitive, and it just works.  We've been happy with it thus far."
"I only have the free version of privy but I thoroughly enjoy it's easy to use interface. Also, the integration with other apps is very helpful!"
Easy interface and user friendly. Privy makes my life easier!
Awesome app. Great features for the free level. Good user experience.
"cool app with easy interface, beautiful fonts"
"App does what it says. User interface is not the most user friendly and it takes a while to know your way around. The app would probably score better if there wasn't a pop up from day one asking for a review - at best it's annoying, at worst, it's naive. The developers are doing themselves a disservice by not let users use the app for a while before requesting a review. It may be a five star app, but I find myself reviewing early just so we can get rid of the annoying request display."
"Excellent, easy to use and nice interface!"
"Love it, great interface, easy to use, awesome that it's free"
Simple easy to use interface and much needed.
Great app! easy to use and interface is easy to setup
Great app with very nice interface!
Great design with an intuitive interface and a helpful support center if issues ever arise.
"Great app, 
+ : It keep you sync with shopify customer data account, even with free plan.
+ : Give you a lot off design and template idea. And you free to custom. even with free plan.
-: Sometimes user interface for dashboard and design customization really slow. 
Five star for privy team and privy apps."
"Just Getting Started....
Looking good so far. 
Simple Interface.
I like the on hand Help Desk CHAT."
"easy to use interface, looks good so far"
I like privy as it was a quick and simple way of adding pop ups to my store. Easy to design and plug and play with shopify. It seamlessly interfaces with mailchimp.
Great interface. Easy to build campaigns.
Privy offers a point-and-shoot interface to build popups for collecting email subscribers. Easy to use and test.
"Easy to setup, lots of customization options, VERY easy click/drag/type interface... prices for the premium features seem a little high. We'll see how far the free version gets me, and then upgrade as needed. So far so good!"
Privy made it super simple to setup an effective newsletter popup for my new discbound notebooks at www.pacificandwest.com - The design interface is really easy to use - awesome app!
"so far so good :) i started to use privy and the interface is very friendly and easy to use. i can gather many emails for my email list, the redemption rate is pretty good - so all in all i am happy with the app."
Trying out only for a few days. Simple interface. Everything going fine. I shall see how it goes in a couple of months.
Very user friendly interface. Simple and does the job!
"5/11/18 update: still working. a few bot address manage to get added each time I check but not sure anything can be done for that.
1/6 update: list growth solid so far. minimal effort on my part. 6 tars If I could.
1/1 So far so good. Just finished setting it up, very intuitive interface. Still clicking around and setting things up."
Awesome interface! Easy to understand and customize. Thank you Privy!
It's great.  We like the interface.  See the app in action at www.wrister.com
"Very easy to use, love the wizard and WYSIWYG interface!"
very good and simple beautiful interface
"Easy to set up, very clear interface. Thank you privy!"
"Great app for building an email list. Easy setup, intuitive interface, flexible design features and excellent support if needed. Our store has benefited by using Privy for the past several months."
"I am using the free version of this app and I am very happy with the functionality as well as the user interface. Simple to use and clear. There is quite a bit of value built into the free version. There are even baseline analytics which is kind of a nice extra! The pop up is very attractive. Whenever I see it, I smile. The Privy logo which shows in the free version of the pop-up is not overwhelming. I am sensitive to branding like this inside my own brand, and it honestly does not bother me enough to switch to paid. Very elegant pop up. The colors and more are customizable. I would recommend Privy as a free pop-up for anyone with a Shopify store. The paid features may tempt me eventually, but for now, the free version is perfect."
"Excellent App! Amazing interface, very easy to use, super crispy! Thanks Privy!"
good design. simple interface. quick customer support. 5/5
"Extremely Great interface. Just trying the Free version, hope the campaign works out!"
"Friendly interface, simple to set up. Seems powerful.  A lot of staff are locked in the free plan."
"Was looking for a solution to capture emails and got so much more from Privy!  Thank you for an easy to use, beautifully designed interface. Can't wait to learn what else I can do with the program!! Thanks Privy!"
Very effective for capturing quality leads and great user interface to make some really cool and professional designs.
Very user friendly interface and bring results! Glad to have it at gemsty.com
I really like their easy to use design interface.  Their free pricing with upgrade options is a wise idea.  Many others are over priced.
Straightforward design tools and interface. Easy to get up and running and mange.
"Easy to use interface and plenty of options.  In less than 24 hours I'm already seeing sign ups come in.  It would be great to be able to select which pages/templates specific marketing appears on at a lower price point, but other than that I'm very happy so far."
Nice clean interface.  Easy to install and configure.
"Really good app! Gets what you need done, in simple and easy way, also - the interface of the app and the designs options it offers, all look great."
Great interface and easy to use
works great! Easy to use and design. They are always improving the interface which I like to see.
Easy to use interface. Great deal if you're getting the free package.
Simple to use interface. Would be nice if there were a few more design options and control.
Easy to use and nice interface!
Brilliant app! Simple interface and easy to use. I've been using it for a while now on www.theappareleffect.com.au and I highly recommend it. It's free so it's great value and can link to your Mailchimp account too!
"Excellent app. Very flexible and does exactly what it is supposed to do (unlike other apps here). The user interface is lovely, and we they get brownie points for the fun confetti displayed after signup. Some paid apps could definitely learn a thing or two with these guys! Thanks!"
"Hello,  I'm just starting out, but I like the user interface and compatibility with Shopify!  I would recommend to a friend.
Thanks,
Missy"
"Interface is slightly confusing at first, but once you understand how the form builder works it's easy to use. Gets the job done (and for free!)."
"Works great. Smooth interface, was up and running very quickly."
Privy has an easy to understand interface with versatile options for obtaining visitors' information.  I like the plugin and would certainly recommend it to friends.
Easy-to-use interface. Reliable.
Very user-friendly interface.
Does exactly what it claims to offer. Easy to use interface and technology for grabbing users on their way out is effective. Good upgrade might be to allow expiring offers right in the app for creating urgency.
"This app has been doing exactly what we wanted it to do. Very simple user interface to understand for us non-programmer types.  We are about to upgrade the app now to unlock more features. But I must say.. as it stands, we give it two thumbs up! 
www.valstech.com"
"Great app, does exactly what we needed. Great user experience!"
So easy to use and works fantastic. It has settings to make it operate discreetly without driving my visitors crazy. Interfaces with my pro e-mail service seamlessly! I also like the fact the app developer is ready to help when and if you need it.
I've just started using Privy but it's the best email pop-up service I have ever used. Extremely easy to use WYSIWYG interface and helpful tutorials and tip! Thank you Privy!
"Overall this is a great app for pop-ups and email capture.
The interface is clean and professional and service is excellent.
One thing that bugs me is the monthly price.
If you want to get more detailed information from your subscribers, the dynamic hidden fields are only available on the Growth account which is 199$ per month.
I'm presently looking for another option since I can't really afford to invest 2400$ per year on this option yet..."
"I like it so far, very easy to use and implement.  The interface is great!"
Amazingly intuitive and lean interface. Professional designing with zero skill requirement. Love it!
"Absolutely loving the Privy app. We had tried quite a few apps before discovering Privy, and finally here's an app that hits it out of the park.
Extremely robust, slick and intuitive interface, in app analytics, and loaded with customizable features. So very impressed with Privy, can't wait to keep experimenting.
Don't miss out on this powerful tool, it can absolutely change your business.

"As someone who isn't a developer or designer, Privy is a great tool that was simple to setup, create great looking branded forms, and best of all start collecting leads from visitors to our store.
It easily integrated with our email marketing tool, Klaviyo, so we were up and running in minutes subscribing people to different lists/sequences based on where they signed up and what we are trying to accomplish.  
The interface to create email capture forms and lightboxes is intuitive and simple to use so anyone can easily create great looking, branded, lead capture experiences for your site.

"Awesome app! 
+ Easy to set up - no messing around with codes!
+ Seemless integration
+ User friendly interface
+ Produces results
Highly recommended!!"
"Privy is head and shoulders above any popup / messaging app we've tried. An we have tested many. Far superior to Sumo Me, Optinmonster, JustUno and the literally dozens of solutions we've trailed. The interface is elegant, simple to use and yet powerful - targeting & integration features are superb. So sorry we'd not found you months ago Privy!"
"Really clean interface, really easy to plug and play. It lets you customize when and where your pop-up appears on the page, as well as what actions you want to trigger it to appear.
I also like that you pay for features, not for the number users you acquire."
"I was looking for a good popup email recruiter to my newly launched ecommerce store, www.berobinhood.com and stumbled across privy after trying out several others and found it works great! The interface is very simple to use and integrate into my shopify page and it looks very professional as well. My list is steadily growing due to Privy! It's been a couple weeks and so far no complaints."
Awesome awesome app. Just installed it and the user interface is exceedingly friendly. Can't wait to see the results!
